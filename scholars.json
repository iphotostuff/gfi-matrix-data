    "bio": "Wolterstorff was born on January 21, 1932, to Dutch emigrants in a small farming community in southwest Minnesota. After earning his BA in philosophy at Calvin College, Grand Rapids, Michigan, in 1953, he entered Harvard University, where he earned his MA and PhD in philosophy, completing his studies in 1956. He then spent a year at the University of Cambridge, where he met C. D. Broad. From 1957 to 1959, he was an instructor in philosophy at Yale University. Then he took the post of Professor of Philosophy at Calvin College and taught for 30 years. He is now teaching at Yale as Noah Porter Professor Emeritus Philosophical Theology.\n\nIn 1987 Wolterstorff published Lament for a Son after the untimely death of his 25-year-old son Eric in a mountain climbing accident. In a series of short essays, Wolterstorff recounts how he drew on his Christian faith to cope with his grief. Wolterstorff explained that he published the book \"in the hope that it will be of help to some of those who find themselves with us in the company of mourners.\"\n\nHe has been a visiting professor at Harvard University, Princeton University, Yale University, the University of Oxford, the University of Notre Dame, the University of Texas, the University of Michigan, Temple University, the Free University of Amsterdam (Vrije Universiteit), and the University of Virginia. In 2007, he received an honorary Doctorate in Philosophy from Vrije Universiteit Amsterdam. He has been retired since June 2002.\n\nWolterstorff published his memoir with William B. Eerdmans Publishing Co. in 2019, illustrating the close relationship between his personal life and his distinguished academic career.",

      "I retired from my professorship at Yale at the end of 2001. In my case, retirement has not meant inactivity. Since retirement, I have published four books on justice, two on political philosophy and theology, two on liturgy, one on art, one titled Religion in the University, and a memoir titled In This World of Wonders. During this past year I have written a rather long article on justice for the newly-inaugurated St Andrews Encyclopedia of Theology, and the plenary address for an upcoming (January) symposium titled “Screen Stories and Moral Understanding,” organized by Prof. Carl Plantinga (Calvin U.) and sponsored by the Templeton Foundation. I continue to be strongly interested in justice, art, and liturgy. The editors of the newly established Analyzing Theology series (Jonathan Cockayne and Joshua Rutledge) have put together, for the first volume in their series, a collection of my articles, some published, some unpublished, titled United by Love: Justice, Art, and Liturgy."

His research interests included applied industrial economics, and the interface between Christian ethics and economics. His published work included one of the first papers on strategic entry deterrence in spatial markets, a paper on the impact on manufacturing firms of the Brazilian trade liberalization, a monograph (with Derek Morris, Shujie Yao, and Guy Liu) on the effects of market liberalization on Chinese manufacturing firms, and a book on Christianity and economics. He also maintained an interest in the reform of competition policy in the UK. He taught microeconomics, industrial organization (at both graduate and undergraduate level), and supervised several doctoral theses in industrial economics. He published, with Derek Morris, an advanced textbook, Industrial Economics and Organisation: Theory and Evidence (second edition, 1991). In 2000 he became the first Head of the Division of Social Sciences in the University, a position he held for five years. He acted as Pro Vice Chancellor for Planning and Resources 2006-7, and was responsible for the implementation of the University Resource Allocation System (the JRAM) in 2009. Since 2009 he has been fully retired. His main interest in retirement has been the development of a program, Developing a Christian Mind, to enable Christian graduate students, researchers and academics (across all disciplines) to begin to integrate their faith and their academic activities.",

Before his retirement, he held the Diana Unwin Chair in Restorative Justice in the University's School of Government from 2014-20. Prior to that he was the St John’s Professor of Christian Theology in the Religious Studies Programme. Dr Marshall is author of seven books and multiple articles, book chapters, reference work entries and research reports, and has been widely used as a conference speaker and lecturer in over a dozen countries around the world. He has won several awards for his teaching and for his public engagement on social issues, and has also written on human rights, religious violence and Christian non-violence. His most important work lies at the intersection between theological ethics and criminal justice theory and practice. He characterises his distinctive methodology as one of setting up a “dialogue” between biblical teaching on law, crime, justice, violence and punishment on the one hand, and the insights of restorative justice theory, legal philosophy and the social sciences on the other. His book Beyond Retribution (Eerdmans, 2001) seeks to construct a moral, theological and biblical basis for restorative justice practice, as well as to critique the dominant notion of retributive justice. His 2012 book, Compassionate Justice: An Interdisciplinary Dialogue (Cascade, 2012) uses Jesus’ two most famous parables – the Good Samaritan and the Prodigal Son – as a serious resource for undertaking theoretical, practical and even institutional reflection on the meaning of justice. His latest book All Things Reconciled (Cascade 2018) brings together nine essays that deal with issues of perennial relevance to anyone interested in exploring the mandate for Christian social engagement in peace and justice issues.",

      "Now in retirement, I continue to work on innovative applications of restorative justice theory and practice for addressing social harms and promoting the common good across the full range of institutional life, including life in the church. Restorative justice refers to a relational way of responding to wrongdoing, conflict or injustice that seeks, above all else, to repair the harm suffered, and to do so, where possible, by actively involving the affected parties in facilitated dialogue and decision-making about their needs and obligations and about how to bring about positive changes for all involved. Emerging in the criminal justice arena in the early 1970s, the principles and practices of restorative justice have since migrated into many other spheres of social life, offering productive new ways of responding to relational harm and building inclusive and democratic communities."

I am therefore particularly interested in a) the ascent of Form-Based-Codes (a post-sprawl / anti-sprawl invention of the Congress for the New Urbanism), which presume and permit a mix of uses within pedestrian proximity, and zone not according to use but according to density and building types ; and b) land value taxation, which would incentivize development and dis-incentivize private land-banking by taxing the rental value of land and not taxing the value of buildings and other improvements to land ). My interest in both FBCs and land value taxation is as alternative forms of positive law pertinent to land use that would better incentivize and reward environmental stewardship, promote a more just distribution of external / instrumental goods (including housing) to families, laborers, and entrepreneurs, and perforce better serve the common good.",

One of those places is northern Canada, the so-called Canadian Shield. Over the past decade, my students and I have investigated one particular location in the Shield about 1300 km north of Edmonton, the Acasta Gneiss Complex, that contains some rocks that are about 4 billion years old. We conduct fieldwork in this remote location and subsequent laboratory work on the rock samples we collect. Specifically, we use the chemical and isotopic composition of the rocks and individual minerals in these rocks to gain insights on how these rocks and in turn the most ancient continental crust formed."

We can then study how electricity flows through the molecule one electron at a time. We can measure vibrations in a tube of carbon atoms about 1/50,000 the diameter of a human hair, and see how the nineteenth century laws of thermodynamics developed for steam engines apply to such a tiny structure. We use machine learning (the fastest moving topic in AI) to take real time decisions in the lab about what to measure next and to perform the experiments faster and better than a human can.

    "bio": "Born in Córdoba, Spain (1970), Javier Sánchez-Cañizares studied for a degree in Physics at the Autonomous University of Madrid (1993), where he also obtained a Ph.D. with a thesis entitled “Self-consistent description of transport in quasi-one-dimensional superconducting wires” (1999) belonging in the field of Condensed Matter Physics. In 2001, he moved to Rome for a Bachelor’s and Ph.D. in Fundamental Theology at the Pontifical University of the Holy Cross. This second thesis tackled the revelation of God in creation within the patristic quotations of the Areopagus sermon (Acts 17:16-34). It was supervised by the physicist and theologian Giuseppe Tanzella-Nitti.\n\nAfter being ordained a priest in 2005, he settled in Pamplona (Spain), where he has been teaching at the University of Navarra until the present date. Since 2016 he is an Associate Professor of \"Science, Reason, and Faith\" and a member of the CRYF group, founded by the late Mariano Artigas. He is also a researcher of the Mind-brain group of the Institute for Culture and Society and, as of 2022, an accredited full professor.\n\nHe was the leader of the project “Science and Religion in Spanish Schools,” funded during the period 2018-2021 by the John Templeton Foundation. He belongs to the scientific council of the international interdisciplinary journal “Scientia et Fides.” He is also a member of the Society of Catholic Scientists, where he lectured at several conferences.\n\nJavier Sánchez-Cañizares' book \"Universo Singular\" won one of the 2018 Expanded Reason Awards in the research category, organized on a yearly basis by the Francisco de Vitoria University together with the Vatican Foundation Joseph Ratzinger - Benedict XVI. \"Universo singular\" introduces the reader to the context of contemporary physics to reveal some singularities that occur in our knowledge of the universe. The existence of these singularities points to an emergence of authentic novelties in nature, appealing to the use of an expanded reason that helps to understand the world we inhabit. The book thus offers a necessary starting point, rooted in science, to renew philosophical reflection on the cosmos.",

As a junior doctor, Tim and his wife Miriam lived and worked in Juba, South Sudan, for two years helping to establish a new clinical medical school in that very under resourced setting. On returning to UK Tm specialised in Clinical Oncology initially in Cardiff and undertook his research training at Cambridge under Prof Norman Bleehen at the MRC Clinical Oncology and Radiotherapeutics Unit. Thereafter he worked as an NHS consultant Clinical Oncologist in Cardiff, becoming Professor of Cancer Studies in 2007. During that time, he established the first clinical research network, the Wales Cancer Trials Network, and was subsequently involved in the development of the clinical research networks across the UK.\n\nTim had the vision and was appointed to set up and chair the NCRI CTRad – the clinical and translational radiotherapy working group. This organisation has been running for 10 years, is funded by a coalition of funders through the NCRI (National Cancer Research Institute) and unites and drives much of the radiotherapy related research activity in the UK.\n\nTim’s research has focused on colorectal cancer: he has initiated and led a series of national trials and currently leads the MRC FOCUS4 trial of molecular selection of treatment and the MRC/CR-UK stratified medicine consortium in colorectal cancer (S:CORT). He has published over 200 peer reviewed papers.\n\nTim Maughan was appointed Professor of Clinical Oncology and Clinical Director of the MRC-CRUK Oxford Institute of Radiation Oncology, Department of Oncology at the University of Oxford in 2011. He has chaired Cancer Research UK’s Clinical Research Committee and currently chairs the NCRI Strategy Advisory Group.\n\nThroughout his career, Tim’s Christian faith, his marriage to Miriam and their family life have been fundamental to his vision and persistence in pursuing these aims.",

She was appointed to the Reference Panel of the New Zealand Law Commission’s Review of the Law of Trusts (2010-2013). In 2015, she won the University of Otago Rowheath Trust Award and Carl Smith Medal for outstanding scholarly research achievement across all disciplines. Most recently, her research has been concerned with claims that many trusts used today ought to be disregarded because too much power rests in one party who may treat the trust assets as its own. Her publications have been influential on the approach taken by courts to these allegations in New Zealand and New South Wales. For example, two of her articles on sham trusts and the control of express trusts have been heavily relied on by the New Zealand Court of Appeal in cases that have attracted much attention for trust and matrimonial property lawyers ( Clayton v Clayton [2015] NZCA 30; Official Assignee v Wilson [2008] NZLR 45). A Court of Appeal judge and New Zealand Law Commissioner has cited her work as an example of the important contribution academic lawyers can make to the development of law (G Hammond, “Judges and Academics in New Zealand” (2013) 25 NZULR 681 at 690).\n\nJessica is an author in two leading textbooks in New Zealand on the law of trusts and on civil remedies (A Butler (ed) Equity and Trusts in New Zealand (2nd ed) Wellington, Thomson Reuters (2009; P Blanchard (ed) Civil Remedies in New Zealand (2nd ed) Wellington, Thomson Reuters (2011)).
