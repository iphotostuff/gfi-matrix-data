I am therefore particularly interested in a) the ascent of Form-Based-Codes (a post-sprawl / anti-sprawl invention of the Congress for the New Urbanism), which presume and permit a mix of uses within pedestrian proximity, and zone not according to use but according to density and building types ; and b) land value taxation, which would incentivize development and dis-incentivize private land-banking by taxing the rental value of land and not taxing the value of buildings and other improvements to land ). My interest in both FBCs and land value taxation is as alternative forms of positive law pertinent to land use that would better incentivize and reward environmental stewardship, promote a more just distribution of external / instrumental goods (including housing) to families, laborers, and entrepreneurs, and perforce better serve the common good.",
