First-order justice consists of justice in our ordinary interactions with each other: teachers and students treating each other justly, merchants and customers treating each other justly, etc. Second-order justice becomes relevant when there has been a violation of first-order justice, that is, when someone has treated someone unjustly, wronged them. It consists of reprimands, punishments, and the like.\n\nMany people, when they hear the word \u201cjustice,\u201d think exclusively of second-order justice. The term \u201cjustice\u201d connotes for them prisons, fines, condemnations. First-order justice is basic, however, in that, if there were no such thing as first-order justice and injustice, there would be no such thing as second-order justice. For that reason, I will focus my discussion on first-order justice.\n\nJustice is fundamental in Christian scripture. Over and over in the Old Testament we read, \u201cI the Lord love justice\u201d (e.g., Isaiah 61:8), and over and over the ancient Israelites were instructed to \u201cseek justice\u201d (e.g., Isaiah 1:17). When the writer of the Gospel of Matthew explains who this mysterious person Jesus is, he identifies him as the one who is fulfilling \u201cwhat had been spoken through the prophet Isaiah.\u201d He \u201cwill proclaim justice to the Gentiles\u201d and will \u201cbring justice to victory\u201d (12:17-20).\n\nAn important point to note about what the Old Testament writers say about justice and injustice in ancient Israel is that, though on occasion they have individual cases in view, usually it is social (systemic) justice that they urge and social (systemic) injustice that they condemn \u2013 that is, justice and injustice in the laws and social practices of Israel.\n\nWhat is justice? Coming down to us from antiquity are two fundamentally different ways of thinking of justice. One comes to us from the Greek philosopher Aristotle, who explained justice as equity or fairness in the distribution of benefits and burdens. The other comes to us from the Roman jurist Ulpian (ca. 170-223 CE), who defined justice as rendering to each what is his or her right, or due (Latin: ius ). I prefer Ulpian\u2019s definition, for the reason that not all cases of injustice consist of the inequitable distribution of benefits or burdens. Suppose that I violate your privacy; then, even if I do nothing with what I learn, I have wronged you, treated you unjustly. But I have not in any way distributed benefits or burdens inequitably. The Ulpian formula tells us that treating someone justly consists of rendering to them what is their right or due \u2013 treating them as they have a right to be treated. Justice is grounded in rights. But what are rights?\n\nAs one would expect, there is a good deal of disagreement on the answer to this question. My view, shared by many, and explicit in the UN documents on rights, is that rights are grounded in the worth (excellence, dignity) of the rights-bearer. Two fundamental facts about human beings are that we all have worth in certain respects and to certain degrees, and that there are ways of treating human beings that show due respect for their worth and ways of treating them that do not show due respect. I have a right to be treated a certain way when, if I were not treated that way, I would not be treated with due respect for my worth. Rights are what respect for worth requires.\n\nScholarship and teaching are inherently communal activities. In our engagement with students and colleagues we are called, one and all, to act justly \u2013 to treat our students and colleagues as they have a right to be treated, to treat them with due respect for their worth. It is evident to all who work in the academy, however, that the call to treat the other person justly is pervasively violated. In the vaunting by professors of their positions of authority, and in the competitive struggle of scholars to get ahead, they ride roughshod over the rights of others. But the biblical call to act justly is relevant not only to how professors and scholars treat each other and their students. In many disciplines and areas of inquiry, considerations of justice belong within the subject matter under consideration. This seems obvious for such disciplines and areas of inquiry as economics, political theory, management, health care, and gender studies, since these all deal directly with interactions among human beings. I say, \u201cThis seems obvious.\u201d It does not seem obvious to everyone. In the work of a good many scholars in these areas, utilitarian considerations of power, efficiency, etc. are so prominent that justice is never brought into the picture.\n\nA bit of reflection shows that considerations of justice are also relevant in disciplines and areas of inquiry where the relevance is not immediately obvious, since they do not deal directly with interactions among human beings. Architecture, for example. The focus of architecture is on buildings. But it is human beings interacting with each other who determine what is built and where. And what is built shapes, for good or ill, the lives of the human beings who inhabit those buildings and of those who must cope with them. Considerations of justice pervade architecture. Consider those disciplines and areas of inquiry that deal with the arts. Here too, while it may not be immediately obvious that considerations of justice are relevant, a bit of reflection shows that they are. Works of the arts are not just \u201cout there\u201d somewhere; they are made and engaged by human beings. And the ways in which they are made and engaged perforce raise issues of justice and injustice. Is it just, for example, that only the relatively well-to-do can afford to attend performances of the local symphony orchestra and choral society? And what colonialist studies of literature have shown us is that the worlds projected by literary works \u2013 how characters are portrayed and how society is pictured -- raise profound issues of justice: gender justice, racial, class, economic, religious.\n\nThe same point could be developed for, say, environmental studies. But rather than developing that point, let me formulate the principle toward which we have been moving: considerations of justice are relevant to any discipline or area of inquiry that deals, in whole or in part, either directly or indirectly, with the interactions of human beings. And that covers most of what takes place in our colleges and universities. It does not cover theoretical physics as such \u2013 but it does cover how physics is developed and applied. It does not cover mathematics as such \u2013 but it does cover how mathematics is developed and employed.\n\nWhen one looks at what scholars study and what professors teach, almost everywhere one sees that they are dealing, in part at least, directly or indirectly, with interactions among human beings. And whenever human beings interact with each other, they are divinely called to treat each other justly.",

    "bodyText": "How may Christian academics engage justice and rights in their scholarship and the academy? God\u2019s love of justice recurs repeatedly in the Old Testament and it is integral to the teaching of Jesus and the Apostles. Consistent with this teaching, I distinguish between first order justice , where agents, individuals and institutions, act justly in their ordinary affairs; and second order justice, which concerns the laws, sanctions and systems that secure first-order justice. I focus on first-order justice as structurally basic. First order justice is best understood as each person or institution rendering to the other what is their right or what is due to them . A right is a morally legitimate claim to something, an entitlement. There are conferred rights, such as those attached to a position or a promise or by law or social practice; and non-conferred rights grounded in the excellence (goodness, worth, dignity, praise-worthiness) of the rights-bearer, such as natural rights and human rights. I show why the recognition of rights-talk is important and how it has an intrinsic connection with duties and obligations. First-order justice should play a pervasive role in the university. On the one hand, since the university is an intensively interactive institution, it is imperative to be alert to justice and injustice, including racism and sexism, in the fine texture of teaching, research, academic administration and collegial interactions. Justice pertains also to relations of scholars and the university with funding agencies, governments, social institutions and publics. On the other hand, considerations of justice belong in the subject matter of most disciplines, in scholarly agendas, methods and theory. I conclude with questions every scholar might ask about the salience of justice and rights for their own research and scholarship and for the character of the academic institutions in which we serve.\n\nMy project in this essay is to bring to light the role of justice for the academy and the importance of being alert to that role. In order to do that, it will be necessary first to discuss the nature and importance of justice as such. [\u00a01\u00a0]\n\nJustice is fundamental in Christian Scripture. Over and over, dozens of times, the writers of the Old Testament declare God\u2019s love of justice. \u201cI the Lord love justice\u201d (61:8), writes the prophet Isaiah. And over and over the writers set forth God\u2019s injunction to Israel to join God in loving justice. In a well-known passage the prophet Micah writes,\n\nThe Lord has told you, O mortal, what is good, and what does the Lord require of you but to do justice, to love kindness, and to walk humbly with your God. (6:8)\n\nAn important point to note about what the Old Testament writers say about justice and injustice in ancient Israel is that almost always it is social (systemic) justice that they urge and social injustice that that they condemn \u2013 that is, justice and injustice in the laws and social practices of Israel. When condemning injustice, they seldom name names of individual wrongdoers. Another important point to note about justice in the Old Testament is that, over and over, the writers connect justice with shalom. Shalom consists of flourishing in all dimensions of one\u2019s existence: in one\u2019s relation to God, to one\u2019s fellow human beings, to the natural world, to oneself. Insofar as one is a victim of injustice, one is obviously not flourishing in that respect. Justice is thus intrinsic to shalom. However, one might be justly treated by all and yet not be flourishing; one might be seriously ill, or the victim of widespread famine. Justice is, as it were, the ground floor of shalom\n\nThe claim has rather often been made by Christian theologians and ethicists that, though justice is indeed prominent in the Old Testament, in the New Testament, justice has been superseded by love. Jesus, it is noted, issued a love-command; he did not issue a justice-command. The classic statement of this position is the 1930s publication, Agape and Eros, by the Swedish Lutheran bishop Anders Nygren. What this position implies, of course, is a dispensationalist understanding of God\u2019s work in history.\n\nI hold that this is a serious misreading of the New Testament. Let\u2019s look at just two of the many relevant New Testament passages. In the Gospel of Luke we read that shortly after Jesus began speaking in public, he attended the synagogue in Nazareth on a Sabbath and was invited to read Scripture and comment on what he had read. He was given the scroll of the prophet Isaiah, unrolled it, and, on Luke\u2019s narration, read the following:\n\nThe Spirit of the Lord is upon me, because he has anointed me to bring good news to the poor. He has sent me to proclaim release to the captives and recovery of sight to the blind, to let the oppressed go free, to proclaim the year of the Lord\u2019s favor.\n\nLuke reports that Jesus then rolled up the scroll, gave it back to the attendant, and sat down. \u201cThe eyes of all were fixed on him,\u201d writes Luke, expecting him to offer some comment on what he had read. Jesus then said, \u201cToday this scripture has been fulfilled in your hearing.\u201d\n\nWhat Luke reports Jesus as reading is an adaptation of the opening verses of Isaiah 61, which read as follows:\n\nThe Spirit of the Lord God is upon me, because the Lord has anointed me; he has sent me to bring good news to the oppressed, to bind up the brokenhearted, to proclaim liberty to the captives, and release to the prisoners; to proclaim the year of the Lord\u2019s favor, and the day of vengeance of our God.\n\nThe passage is a close parallel of a passage in an earlier chapter in which the prophet spoke explicitly of God\u2019s demand for justice:\n\nIs not this the fast that I choose: to loose the bonds of injustice, to undo the thongs of the yoke, to let the oppressed go free and to break every yoke? (Isaiah 58:6-7).\n\nThe import of Jesus\u2019 declaration, \u201cToday this scripture has been fulfilled in your hearing,\u201d is unmistakable: Jesus identified himself as the one anointed by God to proclaim to the poor, the captives, the oppressed, the good news of the inauguration in his person of \u201cthe year of the Lord\u2019s favor\u201d (the Year of Jubilee), when justice will reign.\n\nIn Matthew\u2019s gospel, Jesus has already been teaching and healing for some time when the writer intrudes himself into the story he has been telling to offer his interpretation of Jesus\u2019 identity \u2013 the same interpretation as that which Jesus himself offered in the synagogue. Jesus is \u201cto fulfill what had been spoken through the prophet Isaiah,\u201d namely,\n\nI will put my Spirit upon him, and he will proclaim justice ( krisis ) to the Gentiles\u2026. He will not break a bruised reed or quench a smoldering wick until he brings justice ( krisis ) to victory. (Matthew12:17-20)\n\nWhy is it that, in spite of the passages I have quoted, and a good many others that could be cited as well, it is rather often claimed that justice has been superseded in the New Testament by love? Let me offer a few suggestions.\n\nIn many writers, perhaps most, what accounts for their supersessionist interpretation is primarily their understanding of the meaning of \u201clove\u201d ( agap\u00ea) in the New Testament. Agape is understood as gratuitous benevolence: seeking the good of the other person out of sheer benevolence, rather than because justice (or anything else) requires it. This was Nygren\u2019s interpretation of New Testament agap\u00ea, as it was that of the American theologian Reinhold Niebuhr throughout his career. [\u00a02\u00a0]\n\nIntrinsic to this way of thinking of agap\u00ea is the claim, or assumption, that justice and agapic love are incompatible: if one acts out of agapic love, one does not act as one does because justice requires it; and conversely: if one acts as one does because justice requires it, one does not act out of agapic love.\n\nIs this interpretation of agap\u00ea in the New Testament correct? Might it not be the case that some actions are instances of both agapic love and acting justly? I hold that that is indeed the case. The matter deserves a lengthy discussion; here let me introduce just one consideration.\n\nAll three synoptic gospels report the episode in which Jesus cited the two love commands (Matthew 22: 34-40, Mark 12: 28-34, Luke 10: 25-37). In Matthew\u2019s account of the episode, the Pharisees learned that the Sadducees had been unsuccessful in their attempt to trap Jesus, so they decided to see what they could do.\n\nOne of them, a lawyer, asked him a question to test him: \u2018Teacher, which commandment in the law is the greatest?\u2019\n\nJesus replied:\n\n\u201cYou shall love the Lord your God with all your heart, and with all your soul, and with all your mind.\u201d This is the greatest and first commandment. And a second is like it: \u201cYou shall love your neighbor as yourself.\u201d On these two commandments hang all the law and the prophets.\n\nMatthew reports no response on the part of the lawyer or his Pharisee colleagues. Jesus got it right!\n\nThe first love command is to be found in Deuteronomy 6:5; the second, in Leviticus 19:18. Nothing in the context in which the commands occur in the gospels helps us in determining the meaning of agap\u00ea. Perhaps the context in which they occur in the Torah does help. The second love command is the one relevant to our purposes here.\n\nIn Leviticus, the command to love one\u2019s neighbor as oneself concludes a long list of specific injunctions to Israel as to how it is to live. Jesus and his interlocutors did not regard the love-command as just one among others on that long list. It is \u201cthe greatest.\u201d And not just the greatest. Its function in the Leviticus passage is to sum up the preceding injunctions: \u201cIn short, love your neighbor as yourself.\u201d\n\nFor our purposes, what\u2019s important to note is that, among the long list of injunctions summed up by the command to love one\u2019s neighbor as oneself, are injunctions to act justly: \u201cYou shall not render an unjust judgment; you shall not be partial to the poor or defer to the great; with justice you shall judge your neighbor\u201d (19:15).\n\nThe conclusion is inescapable: acting justly is not incompatible with acting out of agapic love; it\u2019s an example of such love. Love and justice must be understood in such a way that love incorporates justice. Later I will suggest how to understand justice so as to fit this requirement. As for how love should be understood: I suggest that love should be understood not as gratuitous benevolence that pays no attention to what justice requires but as care \u2013 not care for but care about. When I care about you, I seek to promote your good, including the good of your being treated by myself and others as justice requires. Agapic love, understood as care, incorporates acting justly. Its comprehensive goal is shalom.\n\nThe adjective dikaios and the noun dikaiosun\u00ea occur hundreds of times in the Greek text of the New Testament. When those same words occur in the classical Greek writers \u2013 Plato, Aristotle, etc. \u2013 they are almost always translated into English as \u201cjust\u201d and \u201cjustice\u201d respectively. When they occur in commonly used English translations of the Bible, they are almost always translated as \u201crighteous\u201d and \u201crighteousness.\u201d\n\nI take it as obvious that, in present-day idiomatic English, \u201crighteousness\u201d is not a synonym of \u201cjustice,\u201d nor is \u201crighteous\u201d a synonym of \u201cjust.\u201d \u201cRighteousness\u201d denotes a certain trait of personal character. In everyday speech we don\u2019t often, nowadays, describe a person as righteous ; when we do, what we suggest is that the person in question is scrupulously concerned with his or her personal rectitude. Justice, by contrast, is an inter-personal normative state of affairs, specifically, the state of affairs that obtains when people treat each other justly. And a just person is one who habitually treats his or her fellows justly.\n\nWhen we look at the contexts within which the terms dikaios and dikaiosun\u00ea occur in the Greek New Testament, we have to conclude that the reference is seldom to the interior character trait of righteousness. Almost always there is a reference or allusion to action \u2013 sometimes, to just action, sometimes, less precisely, to right action . Let\u2019s look at just two occurrences of the terms, out of hundreds, and judge, in the light of their context, how they are best translated; one doesn\u2019t have to know Greek to do this. [\u00a03\u00a0] I will use the NRSV translation.\n\nIn the Beatitudes as reported in Matthew we read, \u201cBlessed are those who hunger and thirst for righteousness , for they will be filled\u201d (5:6). The Greek word translated as \u201crighteousness\u201d is, again, dikaiosun\u00ea. This translation strikes me as strange. Does one hunger and thirst for a certain character trait? Striving for righteousness, for personal rectitude, that makes sense. But hungering and thirsting for it ? One wants to say: \u201cDon\u2019t just hunger and thirst for rectitude; act uprightly.\u201d By contrast: whether justice is present in society is mostly out of one\u2019s control; it depends on what others are doing. That\u2019s why one hungers and thirsts for justice. Jesus is blessing those who hunger and thirst for justice in society.\n\nIn Romans 1:17, Paul states the main theme of the letter that follows: The gospel \u201cis the power of God for salvation to everyone who has faith, to the Jew first and also to the Greek. For in it the dikaiosun\u00ea of God is revealed through faith for faith; as it is written, \u2018The one who is dikaios will live by faith\u2019.\u201d In most commonly used translations, dikaiosun\u00ea is translated as \u201crighteousness\u201d and dikaios as righteous. But when we read the letter that follows, what we learn is that God offers justification impartially to Jews and Greeks alike. \u201cGod shows no partiality\u201d (2:11). To distribute a benefit impartially is to act justly. The main theme of Romans is not about God righteousness \u2013 whatever that might be \u2013 but about God\u2019s justice. [\u00a04\u00a0]\n\nIn one of the Psalms we read:\n\nHappy are those who observe justice, who act rightly at all times (106:3)\n\nIn the law code delivered by Moses to Israel, and recorded in the Old Testament book of Deuteronomy, we find this passage:\n\nYou shall appoint judges and officials throughout your tribes, in all your towns that the Lord your God is giving you, and they shall render just decisions for the people. You must not distort justice, you must not show partiality; and you must not accept bribes, for a bribe blinds the eyes of the wise and subverts the cause of those who are in the right. Justice, and only justice, you shall pursue. (16:18-20)\n\nMoses is clearly referring to a fundamentally different type of justice from that to which the Psalmist is referring. The Psalmist is referring to justice in how we treat others in our ordinary affairs \u2013 justice in how people \u201cconduct their affairs.\u201d \u201cHappy are those who observe justice\u2026at all times.\u201d Moses, by contrast, is referring to justice in judicial proceedings \u2013 the type of justice that becomes relevant when someone has not \u201cconduct[ed] their affairs with justice.\u201d [\u00a05\u00a0]\n\nThat there are these two fundamentally different types of justice was noted already by Aristotle. The traditional terms for them are \u201cdistributive justice\u201d and \u201cretributive justice.\u2019 I think neither term is satisfactory. Let me here explain here why I think the term \u201cdistributive justice\u201d is not satisfactory; a bit later I will explain why the term \u201cretributive justice\u201d is not.\n\nAristotle held that justice of both types consists of the equitable (fair) distribution of benefits and/or burdens; injustice, of an inequitable distribution. As one would expect, what constitutes equity of distribution has been the subject of extended discussions among philosophers. Aristotle\u2019s idea, in the words of the contemporary American political philosopher Joel Feinberg, was that \u201cjustice requires that relevantly similar cases be treated similarly, and relevantly dissimilar cases be treated dissimilarly in direct proportion to the relevant differences between them.\u201d [\u00a06\u00a0] I have elsewhere argued that there is no one thing, neither equity nor anything else, that accounts for what makes distributions in general just. Distributions are just (and unjust) for a variety of different reasons.\n\nBe that as it may, the reason I hold that the term \u201cdistributive justice\u201d should be rejected for that type of justice which consists of agents acting justly in their ordinary affairs is that, though such justice is often to be located in how benefits and/or burdens are distributed, that is not always the case. Rape is a profound violation of justice, a profound wrong. But what fundamentally makes it wrong is not that benefits and burdens have been mal-distributed -- though they have been. What makes it wrong is that the victim has been violated, treated with indignity. Another example: suppose the government secretly invades my privacy without warrant. It has violated justice, wronged me. But there has been no distribution of benefits or burdens, and hence no mal -distribution.\n\nI propose calling the type of justice that consists of agents acting justly in their ordinary affairs, first-order justice: universities treating their support staff justly, teachers and students treating each other justly, banks treating justly people of color who are seeking loans, etc. Justice in the distribution of benefits and/or burdens is one among other forms of first-order justice.\n\nFirst-order justice includes both systemic justice and \u201cone off\u201d cases of just action. And the term \u201cagents,\u201d in the formula for first-order justice that I offered above, must be understood as including not only individuals but also social entities such as institutions, organizations, groups, and the like. There is justice and injustice in the relation between banks and corporations, between a coal-burning plant and an asthmatic child in the area, between a Syrian refugee and an affluent European country, between health providers and patients, between states at the center of geopolitics and tiny Pacific island states \u2013 on and on. It\u2019s because social entities can act unjustly and be treated unjustly that they can sue and be sued. [\u00a07\u00a0]\n\nWhen there has been a violation of first-order justice, there are just and unjust ways of responding to that violation; I shall call just ways of responding, second-order justice . Punishment is a common form of second-order justice; but there are many other forms as well, such as fines, restitution, censure, banishment, reprimands, pardons, and forgiveness. A type of second-order justice that has become popular in the last fifty years or so is so-called restorative justice , this typically including the wrongdoer acknowledging that he did wrong and apologizing, the victim or their representative offering forgiveness in response to the apology, and restitution by the wrongdoer when that is possible\n\nIt is my impression that many people, when they hear the word \u201cjustice,\u201d think primarily, if not exclusively, of second-order justice; they think of police, court proceedings, punishment, prisons, and the like. Second-order justice is obviously of fundamental importance \u2013 not only for its own sake but also because, given our human proclivity for wrongdoing, first-order justice cannot flourish without the support of a just and effective system of second-order justice. A just and effective legal system will institute both a system of laws and sanctions aimed at securing first-order justice among individuals and social entities, including justice in how the state treats its citizens, and a system of laws and procedures aimed at securing a just exercise by the state of second-order justice.\n\nThough first-order and second-order justice are intertwined, first-order justice is structurally basic in that, if there were no such things as first-order justice and injustice, there would be no such things as second-order justice and injustice. Given this structural connection between the two types of justice, only if one understands first-order justice can one understand second-order justice. For that reason, I will focus my attention, in what follows, on first-order justice. Much of what I say will apply, however, to second-order justice as well.\n\nLest my single-minded focus on justice in this essay leave readers with the wrong impression, let me emphasize that loving God above all and one\u2019s neighbor as oneself are fundamental; justice is a component of neighbor-love, not an alternative. Furthermore, not only is justice never the only virtue exercised (or not exercised) in our interactions; acting justly requires the exercise of other virtues. To name just a few: it requires attentiveness to the worth and dignity of others, it requires empathy with the condition of others, it requires humility.\n\nThe biblical writers do not explain what justice is; they assume we understand what they are talking about when they speak of justice. They do not offer a \u201ctheory\u201d of justice. For an explanation of what justice is, a theory, we have to turn to philosophers. [\u00a08\u00a0] Christians will, of course, require of a philosophical theory of justice that it be, among other things, compatible with what the biblical writers say about justice \u2013 and more than compatible, that it illuminate what they say.\n\nComing down to us from antiquity are two fundamentally different accounts of what justice is. One comes from Aristotle who, as we saw, explained justice as equity (fairness) in the distribution of benefits and/or burdens. [\u00a09\u00a0] The other comes from the Roman jurist Ulpian (ca. 170-223 CE). Referring to the virtue of being just, Ulpian says that justice ( iustitia ) is a steady and enduring will to render to each his or her ius ( suum ius cuique tribuere ).\n\nHow should we translate Ulpian\u2019s term ius into present-day English? A common translation is \u201cright\u201d: justice is rendering to each their right. An alternative translation would be \u201cdue\u201d: justice is rendering to each what is their due. Ulpian\u2019s thought is that the virtue of justice (being just) is a steady and enduring will to render to each what is their right, their due. Justice understood as a state of affairs in society consists, correspondingly, of each individual or social entity rendering to each what they have a right to, what is due them.\n\nI have already indicated why Aristotle\u2019s account will not do. Not all instances of first-order justice are cases of an equitable distribution of benefits and/or burdens, nor are all instances of injustice cases of an inequitable distribution of benefits and/or burdens. Ulpian seems to me to have gotten it right. All instances of first-order justice are cases of an agent rendering to another what is their right or due; all instances of first-order injustice are cases of an agent not rendering to another their right or due.\n\nBut what are rights, and what accounts for agents having the rights they do have? The answer to this question is a subject of deep controversy among philosophers. To the best of my knowledge, all parties agree that a right is a morally legitimate claim to something; rights are entitlements. And as to what accounts for agents having the rights they do have, all parties agree that individuals possess certain rights because of some official position that the person occupies, that individuals and social entities possess other rights because of some speech act directed toward them, such as a promise, and that individuals and social entities possess yet other rights because they have been conferred, by law or social practice, on all individuals or social entities of a certain standing. My right to a monthly Social Security check from the U.S government is an example of this last sort. Rights of this last sort have traditionally been called positive rights; rights of the other two sorts have no common name. Let me call rights of all three sorts, conferred rights.\n\nHowever, by no means are all rights conferred. We have some of our rights just by virtue of being the sort of creature that we are \u2013 a person needing food, clothes, respect, and so forth\u2014and standing in the sort of relations in which we do stand. So what accounts for the fact that one has a non-conferred right to some ways of being treated that would be a good in one\u2019s life whereas, to other such ways, one does not have a right? This, in my judgment, is the most difficult and controversial question that a theory of rights has to face.\n\nBegin with the fact that what one has a right to is always a good in one\u2019s life, a life-good, never a life-evil. A life-good to which one has a right is, or implies, a way of being treated. That is not always evident on the face of things. My purchase of a ticket gives me the right to a seat on the plane; and that, obviously, is not a way of being treated! However, what\u2019s implied by my right to a seat on the plane is that I have a right to the airline officials permitting me to take a seat on the plane; and that is a way of being treated . The right to free exercise of one\u2019s religion is, similarly, the right to be permitted to exercise one\u2019s religion freely; it is a freedom right, of which there are many others as well: the right to freedom of speech, for example, the right to assemble, to vote, to start a business.\n\nThough that to which one has a right always is, or implies, some life-good of being treated a certain way, the converse is not the case: there are many ways of being treated that would be a good in one\u2019s life to which one does not have a right.\n\nA view on the matter that is currently prominent in the literature is that such rights are all either conditions for the enjoyment of, or specifications of, our fundamental non-conferred right to autonomy \u2013 that is, our fundamental non-conferred right to form for ourselves a plan of life and to enact that plan. [\u00a010\u00a0] Popular though this theory is, it has to be rejected. One problem confronting the theory is explaining what that purported non-conferred right to autonomy amounts to. Clearly nobody has the right to do whatever he or she sees fit; so what, then, is that purported right to autonomy? I judge that no autonomy theorist has succeeded in answering this question. But we don\u2019t have to read around in the discussions surrounding the nature of autonomy to see that the theory won\u2019t do. I trust that everybody reading this essay will agree that to torture imprisoned criminals as a way of punishing them is to wrong them; they have a non-conferred right not to be punished by torture. To employ torture as a method of punishment is to treat them unjustly. But what makes it wrong is not that their autonomy is thereby impaired; their autonomy is already impaired; they are locked up. What\u2019s wrong about torturing them, I suggest, is that their dignity as human beings is violated\n\nAnd in general, it\u2019s my view, shared by many and explicit in the UN rights documents, that non-conferred rights are grounded in the excellence (goodness, worth, dignity, praise-worthiness) of the rights-bearer. I have a right to the life-good of being treated a certain way ju8st in case, were I not treated that way, I would be treated in a way that does not befit my worth, my dignity, my praiseworthiness. The philosopher Jean Hampton put it well: A person wrongs another, treats them as they have a right not to be treated, \u201cif and only if (while acting as a responsible agent) she treat him in a way that is objectively\u2026demeaning, that is disrespectful of [that person\u2019s] worth.\u201d [\u00a011\u00a0]\n\nTwo fundamental facts about human beings is that we all have excellence in certain respects and to certain degrees, and that there are ways of treating us that show due respect for some excellence that we possess, and other ways of treating us that do not show due respect. Non-conferred rights are what respect for excellence requires. For example: if an election official rejects my ballot for the irrelevant reason that my signature did not include my middle name whereas my driver\u2019s license does, I am not being treated with due respect for my being a duly registered adult citizen of the state of Michigan.\n\nThe praiseworthiness that grounds the right to the gold medal of the person who has won the race is an acquired praiseworthiness. But not all rights-grounding excellences are acquired. Some we have on account of some property we naturally possess, such as bearing the image of God, being capable of speech (which grounds one\u2019s right to freedom of speech), and being religious (which grounds one\u2019s right to free exercise of one\u2019s religion). The rights grounded by such excellences have traditionally been called natural rights. An important sub-set of natural rights are human rights \u2013 rights that one has just by virtue of being a human person or human being. [\u00a012\u00a0] An example of an excellence that grounds a natural right that is not a human right is having exceptional mathematical ability. This sort of praiseworthiness is not acquired; the right of such a person to due respect for his mathematical ability is, accordingly, a natural right. But it\u2019s not a right he has just by virtue of being a human. It\u2019s a right he has by virtue of being a particular sort of human; so it\u2019s not a human right. Two excellences of human persons that ground genuinely human rights are the capacity to interpret oneself and the reality in which one finds oneself, including interpreting it religiously, and the capacity to perform an action for the reason that one judges it to be good or obligatory (the Kantian tradition singled out this excellence). [\u00a013\u00a0]\n\nIt would be a mistake to move on without taking note of the fact that there is hostility in many quarters nowadays to talk about rights, including Christian quarters. This hostility has many roots, the most common being, so it appears to me, the conviction that rights-talk is made to order for expressing one of the most pervasive and malignant diseases of modern society \u2013 namely, the mentality of possessive individualism. It\u2019s made to order, so it is said, for an \u201centitlement society\u201d such as ours in which individuals place themselves at the center of the moral universe, focusing on their own entitlements to the neglect of their obligations toward others and to the neglect of the cultivation of those virtues that are indispensable for the flourishing of our lives together. It both encourages, and is encouraged by, the possessive individualism of the capitalist economy and the liberal polity. The theologian Joan Lockwood O\u2019Donovan puts the point crisply: \u201cthe modern liberal concept of right belongs to the socially atomistic and disintegrative philosophy of possessive individualism.\u201d [\u00a014\u00a0] To the best of my knowledge, all those who espouse this critique of rights-thought and rights-talk claim, in support of their interpretation of rights, that the idea of natural rights was devised by the secular individualist philosophers of the Enlightenment. The medieval intellectual historian, Brian Tierney, showed decisively in his 1997 publication, The Idea of Natural Rights, that this historical claim is mistaken. He shows that the canon lawyers of the 12th century were explicitly employing the idea. It was from the seedbed of medieval Christendom that the concept of natural rights emerged, not from the 18th century Enlightenment. [\u00a015\u00a0]\n\nNo doubt rights-talk is often employed in exactly the way the critic charges. But being employed in this way is not intrinsic to rights-talk; it\u2019s an abuse. Every component of our moral vocabulary is subject to abuse. The correct response to the abuse of some moral concept is not to toss out that concept \u2013 we would have no moral vocabulary left -- but to do what one can to correct the abuse.\n\nWhen you and I interact with each other, our normative situation is symmetrical: I have a morally legitimate claim, a right, to being treated in certain ways by you, and you have a morally legitimate claim, a right, to being treated in certain ways by me. One of the respondents to the preview for this essay made this point nicely by saying that we are called to be not only claimants for justice but agents of justice. The possessive individualist employs the language of rights to focus on the former to the neglect of the latter. It\u2019s the mentality of possessive individualism that is the culprit in such cases, not the language of rights. And let\u2019s recall a point made earlier: not only do individuals have rights; social entities such as institutions, organizations, and communities also have rights. My bank can wrong me, but I can also wrong my bank.\n\nHere is perhaps a good place to note that there is an intrinsic connection between rights and duties (obligations): if you have a right to my treating you a certain way, then I have an obligation to treat you that way; and conversely. Given this correlation, it turns out that justice, on the Ulpian conception, consists equally in agents honoring the rights of others and in agents honoring their duties to others.\n\nBut if rights and duties are correlative in that way, and if rights-talk is often abused in the way indicated, why not eliminate rights-talk from our moral vocabulary and make do with talk about duties, obligations, and responsibilities?\n\nCertain things of great importance would be lost if we eliminated rights-talk from our moral vocabulary. The moral order has two dimensions, distinct but intimately connected: the agent-dimension , the dimension of what we do, where the language of duty, obligation, responsibility, guilt, etc. are for bringing to speech this dimension of the moral order; and the patient-dimension , the dimension of how we are done unto, where the language of rights, of what is due one, of being wronged, is for bringing to speech this dimension of the moral order. In some situations, it\u2019s important to bring to speech the agent-dimension by speaking of responsibilities; in other situations, it\u2019s important to bring to speech the patient-dimension by speaking of rights.\n\nConsider the abused wife. With the language of duty, guilt, etc., she can bring to light the agent-dimension of the situation, the moral significance of what her husband is doing. He is failing in his responsibilities to her, his duties; he is guilty. But she cannot bring to light the patient-dimension of the situation, the moral significance of how she is being done unto. For that, she needs the language of rights: she is being wronged, her rights are being violated, she is not being rendered what is due her.\n\nIt\u2019s no accident that all the great social justice movements of the twentieth century, struggling against one or another form of systemic injustice, employed the language of rights: women\u2019s rights, labor rights, civil rights, on and on. It was their use of such language that enabled the members of those movements to bring to speech the moral condition of those who were being systemically wronged.\n\nThere is something else of great importance that would be lost if we eliminated rights-talk from our moral vocabulary. A feature of rights that I have thus far not taken note of is what is sometimes called their trumping force, sometimes, their peremptory force. The idea is this: if you have a right to my treating you a certain way, then, no matter how many good things I might bring about by not treating you that way, I am morally required to treat you that way.\n\nThe best way to see that rights do indeed have this trumping force is to recall the connection, noted above, between rights and duties. If you have a right to my treating you a certain way, then I have an obligation to treat you that way. But if I have an obligation to treat you that way, then I am morally required to treat you that way, period, no matter how many good things I might bring about by not treating you that way. Nothing trumps obligation!\n\nThe twentieth century was rife with authoritarian regimes pursuing policies that they claimed to be for the greater good over the long haul: Hitler, Stalin, Pol Pot, the Afrikaners. If we do not have available to us the language of rights to call attention to the fact that, no matter how much good such policies might bring about, they are nonetheless morally unacceptable because they are trampling on the rights of people, we have no way of putting the brakes on such (self-perceived) benevolence. The point is relevant at the micro-level as well. All too often, benevolence is extended in such a way as to violate the dignity of the recipient; it humiliates. We need the recognition and language of rights for putting a brake on paternalistic benevolence.\n\nThe question has also been raised: can living creatures other than human beings have rights \u2013 animals and plants? When discussing the nature of non-conferred first-order rights I said, with my eye on human beings, that a right one has is always to a way of being treated that would be a good in one\u2019s life \u2013 a life-good. [\u00a016\u00a0] Animals and plants have lives, and there are goods in their lives -- states and happenings in their lives that contribute to their flourishing in their own distinct way, including ways of being treated by human beings that would be goods in their lives.\n\nAt least some of these goods are good in that they contribute to the good of a human being: instrumental goods. Perhaps one thing good about your dog is that it provides you with companionship; that\u2019s an instrumental good. But are animals intrinsically praiseworthy in certain respects, not just instrumentally? My own conviction is that they are. In the opening chapter of the book of Genesis we read that at the end of the sixth day of creation, before the creation of human beings on the seventh day, God stood back, contemplated what had been created, and \u201csaw that it was good.\u201d [\u00a017\u00a0] Aldo Leopold\u2019s A Sand Country Almanac [\u00a018\u00a0] is a treasure trove of extraordinarily perceptive celebrations of the praiseworthiness of the wild plants and animals in his surroundings. The question that needs deep reflection, so it seems to me, is not whether animals and plants are intrinsically praiseworthy in certain ways and to certain degrees, but what form due respect for their excellence should take.\n\nIt is time that we turned our attention to the role of justice in and by and for the academy, and to the importance of being alert to that role. My discussion will be little more than suggestive. My aim is to point to the pervasive role of justice in the academy and to the pervasive presence of injustice.\n\nFirst-order justice pertains to how agents engage each other, how they interact. Teaching is an inherently interactive activity: teachers and students interacting with each other. Scholarship is inherently interactive: scholars interacting with other scholars in their discipline. Academic administration is inherently interactive: administrators interacting with faculty, students, and staff. Laboratory research is interactive. In all these interactions, we are called to act justly -- and to seek the wellbeing of our fellows and institutions in ways that go beyond what justice requires.\n\nThe present-day American academy, for instance, is pervaded by instrumentalist appraisals, that is, appraisals in terms of one or another form of success and failure. What proportion of those who graduate from the college with a pre-med degree are getting into medical school? What proportion of those who graduate from the university with a Ph.D. in English are getting tenure-track positions within a year? How many citations have there been over the past year of publications by members of the philosophy department? Etc. The academy is an arena of success and failure. But it\u2019s also an arena of justice and injustice. And it is at least as important to appraise academic life in terms of justice and injustice, in terms of doing right and being wronged, as it is in terms of success and failure.\n\nIn making such appraisals, it\u2019s imperative that we not only be alert to the racism, sexism, and sexual abuse that pervade the academy but also to justice and injustice in the fine texture of our interactions. Anyone who has participated in the academy for any length of time has heard about, or witnessed, teachers giving unfair tests, teachers humiliating students to whom they have taken a dislike, senior scholars blackmailing young scholars whom they perceive as potential competitors, faculty badmouthing administrators, administrators being rude and heartless to staff. All such actions, and others like them, are instances of injustice, instances of someone being wronged. Those who have heard the biblical call for justice will themselves refrain from all such actions and will seek to halt the injustices they witness.\n\nJustice pertains not only to interactions within the academy but to interactions of academic institutions, and their faculty and staff, with individuals and social entities outside the academy \u2013 scholars interacting with fund-granting entities and publishers, professors functioning as consultants or as public intellectuals, universities interacting with other universities and with state legislatures, policymakers and international organizations, universities interacting with sports associations \u2013 the list goes on and on.\n\nConsider research funding and agenda-setting. One of the respondents to the prospectus for this essay wrote, \u201cResearch priorities are skewed.\u2026.Most studies on global health inequality consider unequal health care and socio-economic conditions but neglect inequality in the production of health knowledge\u2026.Conditions common to developed countries garnered more clinical research than those common to less developed countries. Many of the health needs in less developed countries do not attract attention among developed country researchers, who produce the vast majority of global health knowledge.\u201d\n\nThe relevance to the academy of considerations of justice is not limited, however, to how academic institutions and their members treat each other and how they engage with individuals and social entities outside the academy. In many disciplines and areas of inquiry, considerations of justice belong within the subject-matter of the discipline and a scholar\u2019s area of inquiry. This is obvious for those that deal directly with interactions among human beings and social entities, such as economics, political theory, business and management, sociology and social work, health care, gender studies. I say, \u201cThis is obvious.\u201d Apparently it is not obvious to everyone. In the work of a good many scholars in these disciplines, utilitarian considerations of power, efficiency, cost, preference, etc., are so pervasive that justice is never brought into the picture.\n\nThose who have heard the biblical call for justice will see it as their responsibility to do what they can to resist such reductionism. Those whose specialty is public health will go beyond considerations of cost and efficiency to ask what justice in health care calls for \u2013 attending especially to justice for \u201cthe little ones.\u201d Those whose field is economics will not be content, when appraising the economic health of a society, with determining its GNP but will ask whether that GNP is justly distributed among members of the society. Those who work in the field of education will explore what it is to teach justly, and will ask whether access to quality education is justly distributed within a school district, a city, a county, a state; they too will attend especially to the fate of \u201cthe little ones.\u201d Those who work in political theory and international relations will ask what a just refugee and immigration policy would look like.\n\nHistory is both similar to, and different from, the disciplines mentioned above: similar in that it deals directly with interactions among individuals and social entities, different in that it does not make policy suggestions. Historians who have heard the biblical call for justice will not write hagiographical Great Men histories in which the flaws of the \u201cgreat man\u201d are airbrushed away and the fate of \u201cthe little people\u201d ignored. They will show human history for what it is: a mixture of the noble and the ignoble, of the just and the unjust. And they will narrate not only the accomplishments of the elite and powerful but also the lives of the ordinary people.\n\nA bit of reflection will make clear that considerations of justice are also relevant in disciplines and areas of inquiry that do not deal directly with interactions among human beings and social entities. Architecture, for example. The focus of architecture is on buildings and the space among buildings. But it is human beings interacting with other human beings who design buildings and spaces, deciding, in doing so, for what use and by whom they will be designed and where they will be located. Considerations of justice pervade the practice of architectural design.\n\nOnce buildings have been built, they shape the lives of those who inhabit those buildings and the lives of those who must cope with them. Considerations of justice are relevant at these points as well. Red-lining, zoning, gentrification, and government housing projects, are just four of many examples that could be given of building practices that raise profound issues of justice and injustice. [\u00a019\u00a0]\n\nEngineering and environmental studies raise issues of justice and injustice similar to those raised by architecture. But I must move on. Consider those disciplines and areas of inquiry that deal with arts other than architecture: music, drama, literature, visual art. That considerations of justice are relevant here is even less evident that it was in the case of architecture. But again, a bit of reflection shows that they are.\n\nGender and colonialist studies of literature have shown, in recent years, that the worlds projected by literary works \u2013 how characters are portrayed, how society is pictured, etc. \u2013 raise profound issues of justice: gender justice, racial justice, class justice, economic justice, religious justice. Traditional aesthetics, with its exclusive focus on the aesthetic properties of works of art, ignores such issues.\n\nAdd to this that works of art are not just \u201cout there\u201d somewhere. They are made, performed, displayed, and engaged by human beings; and the ways in which they are made, performed, displayed, and engaged perforce raise issues of justice and injustice. Is it just, for example, that only the relatively well-to-do can attend performances of the local symphony, the local opera, and the local choral society? Does injustice lurk behind the fact that so few of the composers who people the canon of Western classical music are women and so few, people of color?\n\nLet me formulate the principle toward which we have been moving: considerations of justice are relevant to the subject-matter of any discipline or area of inquiry that deals, in whole or in part, either directly or indirectly, with the interactions of human beings and social entities. And that covers most of the disciplines and areas of study in our colleges and universities. It does not cover theoretical natural science as such; but it does cover how physics, chemistry, biology, computer science, etc., are developed, supported, taught, and applied. Neither does it cover mathematics as such; but it does cover how mathematics is developed, supported, taught, and applied.\n\nWhen one looks closely at what scholars study and professors teach, one discerns that, outside mathematics and the natural sciences, they all deal, in part at least, directly or indirectly, with interactions among human beings and social entities. Considerations of justice are relevant to all such interactions.\n\nI wrote the initial draft of this section of my essay on the very same day, July 30, 2020, that the final written words of John Lewis, great American civil rights activist and congressman, appeared in The New York Times (p. A23) . His brief essay included the following words: \u201cI heard the voice of Martin Luther King Jr. on an old radio\u2026.He said it is not enough to say it will get better by and by. He said each of us has a moral obligation to stand up, speak up and speak out. When you see something that is not right, you must say something. You must do something.\u201d King was referring to civil society. His words are as applicable to the academy as they are to civil society.\n\nIn this essay I have posed many questions that I could not address on this occasion. I have had to skip lightly over the verdant terrain of justice and its role in the academy. Much more could be said. Let me conclude with questions that every scholar might ask that bring the theology and ethics of justice and rights into the fullness of the academy and scholarship.\n\nIs there any aspect of my current research, writing or academic performance where the question, \u201cIs it just?\u201d, has salience? (e.g., in my scholarly agenda or method or theory I bring to bear on it)\n\nTo what extent does my discipline in general, and my research topic in particular, incorporate interactions between people and/ or groups?\n\nAre there just or unjust ways that my scholarly products may be applied or utilized?\n\nTo whom does the scholar in my field owe a duty or obligation? Within the academy and beyond the academy?\n\nDo my academic practices, or do academic practices in my discipline, give all persons their due, affirming and cultivating their excellence (e.g., in acknowledgements, attributions and citations, authorship, mentorship, collegial support, teaching and training)?\n\nIn my experience, how just are the core institutions of the academy: recruitment of students and faculty, academic governance, scholarly publishing, academic societies, academic award-giving, academic promotion?\n\nIn the interactional spaces of my scholarly field, where is there manifest injustice, i.e., a failure to express love through giving others their due, or enhancing the quality of their \u201clife-worlds?\u201d\n\nAgencies funding research must establish priorities on topics, research institutions, qualifications of researchers, etc. Are you personally cognizant of what you judge to be injustices in the setting of such priorities?\n\nEmil Brunner, Justice and the Social Order (New York: Harper & Brothers, 1945), for a classic example of a theological account of justice.\n\nJohn Finnis, Natural Law and Human Rights (Oxford: Oxford University Press, 1980), for an attempt to ground human rights in natural law.\n\nLenn E.

I thank them for the extraordinarily rich body of suggestions that they offered for topics to be discussed in the essay itself.\n\n[\u00a02\u00a0] I discuss Nygren and Niebuhr extensively in Part One of my Justice in Love (Grand Rapids: Wm. B. Eerdmans Publ. Co., 2011).\n\n[\u00a03\u00a0] I discuss this issue of translation extensively in Chapter Five of my Justice: Rights and Wrongs (Princeton: Princeton University Press, 2008) and in chapters 14 through 16 of my Journey toward Justice (Grand Rapids: Baker Academic, 2013).\n\n[\u00a04\u00a0] The New Testament scholar, N.T. Wright, in his recently published translation of the New Testament, renders the passage as follows: \u201cThe good news [is] God\u2019s power, bringing salvation for everyone who believes \u2013 to the Jew first, and also, equally, to the Greek. This is because God\u2019s covenant justice is unveiled in it from faithfulness to faithfulness. As it says in the Bible, \u2018the just shall live by faith\u2019.\u201d\n\n[\u00a05\u00a0] Oliver O\u2019Donovan, in The Desire of the Nations , contends that \u201cjustice\u201d ( mishpat ) in the Old Testament refers almost exclusively to justice in judicial proceedings, and that even when, on rare occasions, it does not refer to justice in judicial proceedings, \u201cit has still not lost touch with the context of litigation.\u201d I engage O\u2019Donovan\u2019s claim on pp. 68-75 of my Justice: Rights and Wrongs.\n\n[\u00a06\u00a0] Quoted on p. 209 of my Justice in Love. In Theory of Justice, John Rawls develops a very different understanding of equity (fairness) from Aristotle\u2019s.\n\n[\u00a07\u00a0] The fact that both individuals and social entities can act and be treated justly and unjustly generates four possibilities: justice and injustice in how social entities treat other social entities, in how social entities treat individuals, in how individuals treat social entities, and in how individuals treat individuals.\n\n[\u00a08\u00a0] Someone might suggest that theologians also offer theories of justice. I think not; what they offer is, rather, a systematic account of how justice fits into God\u2019s \u201ceconomy.\u201d\n\n[\u00a09\u00a0] This is how John Rawls understands justice, in his much-discussed Theory of Justice.\n\n[\u00a010\u00a0] A good example of this line of thought is James Griffin, Human Rights (Oxford: Oxford University Press, 2008).\n\n[\u00a011\u00a0] Quoted on p. 296 of my Justice: Rights and Wrongs.\n\n[\u00a012\u00a0] By the term \u201chuman person\u201d I mean a human being capable of functioning as a person. Tiny infants, those in a coma, those sunk deep into dementia, are human beings but not human persons.\n\n[\u00a013\u00a0] In \u201cGrounding the Rights We Have as Human Persons,\u201d in Understanding Liberal Democracy (Oxford: Oxford University Press, 2012), I discuss at length the various excellences of human beings that ground human rights.\n\n[\u00a014\u00a0] Justice: Rights and Wrongs , p.51. The theological ethicist Oliver O\u2019Donovan shares this view of rights. I discuss their view of rights in Part I of my Justice: Rights and Wrongs , titled \u201cThe Archeology of Rights.\u201d\n\n[\u00a015\u00a0] I discuss what I call this \u201ccontest of narratives\u201d in Chapter Two of my Justice: Rights and Wrongs.\n\n[\u00a016\u00a0] A question that naturally arises here is whether social entities have lives. Literally speaking, they do not. But they can flourish, and there can be enhancements and diminutions in their flourishing, and that makes it possible for them to have rights.\n\n[\u00a017\u00a0] A full discussion of what Scripture tells us about the intrinsic praiseworthiness of animals and plants would take note of the repeated declaration that God\u2019s glory is revealed in creation.\n\n[\u00a018\u00a0] New York: Ballantine Books, 1970.\n\n[\u00a019\u00a0] The Inner City Christian Federation in Grand Rapids, Michigan, is an excellent example of a private non-profit organization that consistently employs considerations of justice in its renovation and construction of inner-city housing.",

God\u2019s love of justice recurs repeatedly in the Old Testament and it is integral to the teaching of Jesus and the Apostles.

I focus on first-order justice as structurally basic. First order justice is best understood as each person or institution rendering to the other what is their right or what is due to them<em>. </em>A right is a morally legitimate claim to something, an entitlement. There are <em>conferred </em>rights, such as those attached to a position or a promise or by law or social practice; and <em>non-conferred </em>rights grounded in the excellence (goodness, worth, dignity, praise-worthiness) of the rights-bearer, such as natural rights and human rights. I show why the recognition of rights-talk is important and how it has an intrinsic connection with duties and obligations. First-order justice should play a pervasive role in the university. On the one hand, since the university is an intensively interactive institution, it is imperative to be alert to justice and injustice, including racism and sexism, in the fine texture of teaching, research, academic administration and collegial interactions.

I conclude with questions every scholar might ask about the salience of justice and rights for their own research and scholarship and for the character of the academic institutions in which we serve.</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>My project in this essay is to bring to light the role of justice for the academy and the importance of being alert to that role. In order to do that, it will be necessary first to discuss the nature and importance of justice as such.<a class=\"anchor\" name=\"note1anc\">\u00a0</a><a class=\"note\" href=\"#note1sym\">[\u00a01\u00a0]</a></p>\n<p>Justice is fundamental in Christian Scripture. Over and over, dozens of times, the writers of the Old Testament declare God\u2019s love of justice. \u201cI the Lord love justice\u201d (61:8), writes the prophet Isaiah. And over and over the writers set forth God\u2019s injunction to Israel to join God in loving justice. In a well-known passage the prophet Micah writes,</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>The Lord has told you, O mortal, what is good,<br/>\nand what does the Lord require of you<br/>\nbut to do justice, to love kindness,<br/>\nand to walk humbly with your God. (6:8)</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>The Lord has told you, O mortal, what is good,<br/>\nand what does the Lord require of you<br/>\nbut to do justice, to love kindness,<br/>\nand to walk humbly with your God. (6:8)</p>\n<p>An important point to note about what the Old Testament writers say about justice and injustice in ancient Israel is that almost always it is social (systemic) justice that they urge and social injustice that that they condemn \u2013 that is, justice and injustice in the laws and social practices of Israel. When condemning injustice, they seldom name names of individual wrongdoers. Another important point to note about justice in the Old Testament is that, over and over, the writers connect justice with shalom. Shalom consists of flourishing in all dimensions of one\u2019s existence: in one\u2019s relation to God, to one\u2019s fellow human beings, to the natural world, to oneself. Insofar as one is a victim of injustice, one is obviously not flourishing in that respect. Justice is thus intrinsic to shalom. However, one might be justly treated by all and yet not be flourishing; one might be seriously ill, or the victim of widespread famine. Justice is, as it were, the ground floor of shalom</p>\n<p>The claim has rather often been made by Christian theologians and ethicists that, though justice is indeed prominent in the Old Testament, in the New Testament, justice has been superseded by love. Jesus, it is noted, issued a love-command; he did not issue a justice-command. The classic statement of this position is the 1930s publication,<em> Agape and Eros,</em> by the Swedish Lutheran bishop Anders Nygren.<em> </em>What this position implies, of course, is a dispensationalist understanding of God\u2019s work in history.</p>\n<p>I hold that this is a serious misreading of the New Testament. Let\u2019s look at just two of the many relevant New Testament passages. In the Gospel of Luke we read that shortly after Jesus began speaking in public, he attended the synagogue in Nazareth on a Sabbath and was invited to read Scripture and comment on what he had read. He was given the scroll of the prophet Isaiah, unrolled it, and, on Luke\u2019s narration, read the following:</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>The Spirit of the Lord is upon me,<br/>\nbecause he has anointed me to bring good news to the poor.<br/>\nHe has sent me to proclaim release to the captives<br/>\nand recovery of sight to the blind,<br/>\nto let the oppressed go free,<br/>\nto proclaim the year of the Lord\u2019s favor.</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>The Spirit of the Lord is upon me,<br/>\nbecause he has anointed me to bring good news to the poor.<br/>\nHe has sent me to proclaim release to the captives<br/>\nand recovery of sight to the blind,<br/>\nto let the oppressed go free,<br/>\nto proclaim the year of the Lord\u2019s favor.</p>\n<p>Luke reports that Jesus then rolled up the scroll, gave it back to the attendant, and sat down. \u201cThe eyes of all were fixed on him,\u201d writes Luke, expecting him to offer some comment on what he had read. Jesus then said, \u201cToday this scripture has been fulfilled in your hearing.\u201d</p>\n<p>What Luke reports Jesus as reading is an adaptation of the opening verses of Isaiah 61, which read as follows:</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>The Spirit of the Lord God is upon me,<br/>\nbecause the Lord has anointed me;<br/>\nhe has sent me to bring good news to the oppressed,<br/>\nto bind up the brokenhearted,<br/>\nto proclaim liberty to the captives,<br/>\nand release to the prisoners;<br/>\nto proclaim the year of the Lord\u2019s favor,<br/>\nand the day of vengeance of our God.</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>The Spirit of the Lord God is upon me,<br/>\nbecause the Lord has anointed me;<br/>\nhe has sent me to bring good news to the oppressed,<br/>\nto bind up the brokenhearted,<br/>\nto proclaim liberty to the captives,<br/>\nand release to the prisoners;<br/>\nto proclaim the year of the Lord\u2019s favor,<br/>\nand the day of vengeance of our God.</p>\n<p>The passage is a close parallel of a passage in an earlier chapter in which the prophet spoke explicitly of God\u2019s demand for justice:</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>Is not this the fast that I choose:<br/>\nto loose the bonds of injustice,<br/>\nto undo the thongs of the yoke,<br/>\nto let the oppressed go free<br/>\nand to break every yoke? (Isaiah 58:6-7).</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>Is not this the fast that I choose:<br/>\nto loose the bonds of injustice,<br/>\nto undo the thongs of the yoke,<br/>\nto let the oppressed go free<br/>\nand to break every yoke? (Isaiah 58:6-7).</p>\n<p>The import of Jesus\u2019 declaration, \u201cToday this scripture has been fulfilled in your hearing,\u201d is unmistakable: Jesus identified himself as the one anointed by God to proclaim to the poor, the captives, the oppressed, the good news of the inauguration in his person of \u201cthe year of the Lord\u2019s favor\u201d (the Year of Jubilee), when justice will reign.</p>\n<p>In Matthew\u2019s gospel, Jesus has already been teaching and healing for some time when the writer intrudes himself into the story he has been telling to offer his interpretation of Jesus\u2019 identity \u2013 the same interpretation as that which Jesus himself offered in the synagogue. Jesus is \u201cto fulfill what had been spoken through the prophet Isaiah,\u201d namely,</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>I will put my Spirit upon him,<br/>\nand he will proclaim justice (<em>krisis</em>) to the Gentiles\u2026.<br/>\nHe will not break a bruised reed<br/>\nor quench a smoldering wick<br/>\nuntil he brings justice (<em>krisis</em>) to victory. (Matthew12:17-20)</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>I will put my Spirit upon him,<br/>\nand he will proclaim justice (<em>krisis</em>) to the Gentiles\u2026.<br/>\nHe will not break a bruised reed<br/>\nor quench a smoldering wick<br/>\nuntil he brings justice (<em>krisis</em>) to victory. (Matthew12:17-20)</p>\n<h2>Why the de-justicizing interpretation of the New Testament</h2>\n<p>Why is it that, in spite of the passages I have quoted, and a good many others that could be cited as well, it is rather often claimed that justice has been superseded in the New Testament by love? Let me offer a few suggestions.</p>\n<p>In many writers, perhaps most, what accounts for their supersessionist interpretation is primarily their understanding of the meaning of \u201clove\u201d (<em>agap\u00ea)</em> in the New Testament. Agape is understood as gratuitous benevolence: seeking the good of the other person out of sheer benevolence, rather than because justice (or anything else) requires it. This was Nygren\u2019s interpretation of New Testament <em>agap\u00ea, </em>as it was that of the American theologian Reinhold Niebuhr throughout his career.<a class=\"anchor\" name=\"note2anc\"></a><a class=\"anchor\" name=\"note2anc\">\u00a0</a><a class=\"note\" href=\"#note2sym\">[\u00a02\u00a0]</a></p>\n<p>Intrinsic to this way of thinking of <em>agap\u00ea</em> is the claim, or assumption, that justice and agapic love are incompatible: if one acts out of agapic love, one does not act as one does because justice requires it; and conversely: if one acts as one does because justice requires it, one does not act out of agapic love.</p>\n<p>Is this interpretation of <em>agap\u00ea</em> in the New Testament correct? Might it not be the case that some actions are instances of both agapic love and acting justly? I hold that that is indeed the case. The matter deserves a lengthy discussion; here let me introduce just one consideration.</p>\n<p>All three synoptic gospels report the episode in which Jesus cited the two love commands (Matthew 22: 34-40, Mark 12: 28-34, Luke 10: 25-37). In Matthew\u2019s account of the episode, the Pharisees learned that the Sadducees had been unsuccessful in their attempt to trap Jesus, so they decided to see what they could do.</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>One of them, a lawyer, asked him a question to test him: \u2018Teacher, which commandment in the law is the greatest?\u2019</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>One of them, a lawyer, asked him a question to test him: \u2018Teacher, which commandment in the law is the greatest?\u2019</p>\n<p>Jesus replied:</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>\u201cYou shall love the Lord your God with all your heart, and with all your soul, and with all your mind.\u201d This is the greatest and first commandment. And a second is like it: \u201cYou shall love your neighbor as yourself.\u201d On these two commandments hang all the law and the prophets.</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>\u201cYou shall love the Lord your God with all your heart, and with all your soul, and with all your mind.\u201d This is the greatest and first commandment. And a second is like it: \u201cYou shall love your neighbor as yourself.\u201d On these two commandments hang all the law and the prophets.</p>\n<p>Matthew reports no response on the part of the lawyer or his Pharisee colleagues. Jesus got it right!</p>\n<p>The first love command is to be found in Deuteronomy 6:5; the second, in Leviticus 19:18. Nothing in the context in which the commands occur in the gospels helps us in determining the meaning of <em>agap\u00ea. </em>Perhaps the context in which they occur in the Torah does help. The second love command is the one relevant to our purposes here.</p>\n<p>In Leviticus, the command to love one\u2019s neighbor as oneself concludes a long list of specific injunctions to Israel as to how it is to live. Jesus and his interlocutors did not regard the love-command as just one among others on that long list. It is \u201cthe greatest.\u201d And not just the greatest. Its function in the Leviticus passage is to sum up the preceding injunctions: \u201cIn short, love your neighbor as yourself.\u201d</p>\n<p>For our purposes, what\u2019s important to note is that, among the long list of injunctions summed up by the command to love one\u2019s neighbor as oneself, are injunctions to act justly: \u201cYou shall not render an unjust judgment; you shall not be partial to the poor or defer to the great; with justice you shall judge your neighbor\u201d (19:15).</p>\n<p>The conclusion is inescapable: acting justly is not incompatible with acting out of agapic love; it\u2019s an example of such love. Love and justice must be understood in such a way that love incorporates justice. Later I will suggest how to understand justice so as to fit this requirement. As for how love should be understood: I suggest that love should be understood not as gratuitous benevolence that pays no attention to what justice requires but as <em>care </em>\u2013 not care <em>for </em>but care <em>about. </em>When I care about you, I seek to promote your good, including the good of your being treated by myself and others as justice requires. Agapic love, understood as care, incorporates acting justly. Its comprehensive goal is shalom.</p>\n<h2>A matter of translation</h2>\n<p>The adjective <em>dikaios </em>and the noun <em>dikaiosun\u00ea </em>occur hundreds of times in the Greek text of the New Testament. When those same words occur in the classical Greek writers \u2013 Plato, Aristotle, etc. \u2013 they are almost always translated into English as \u201cjust\u201d and \u201cjustice\u201d respectively. When they occur in commonly used English translations of the Bible, they are almost always translated as \u201crighteous\u201d and \u201crighteousness.\u201d</p>\n<p>I take it as obvious that, in present-day idiomatic English, \u201crighteousness\u201d is not a synonym of \u201cjustice,\u201d nor is \u201crighteous\u201d a synonym of \u201cjust.\u201d \u201cRighteousness\u201d denotes a certain trait of personal character. In everyday speech we don\u2019t often, nowadays, describe a person as <em>righteous</em>; when we do, what we suggest is that the person in question is scrupulously concerned with his or her personal rectitude. Justice, by contrast, is an inter-personal normative state of affairs, specifically, the state of affairs that obtains when people treat each other justly. And a just person is one who habitually treats his or her fellows justly.</p>\n<p>When we look at the contexts within which the terms <em>dikaios </em>and <em>dikaiosun\u00ea</em> occur in the Greek New Testament, we have to conclude that the reference is seldom to the interior character trait of righteousness. Almost always there is a reference or allusion to action \u2013 sometimes, to <em>just action, </em>sometimes, less precisely, to <em>right action</em>. Let\u2019s look at just two occurrences of the terms, out of hundreds, and judge, in the light of their context, how they are best translated; one doesn\u2019t have to know Greek to do this.<a class=\"anchor\" name=\"note3anc\">\u00a0</a><a class=\"note\" href=\"#note3sym\">[\u00a03\u00a0]</a> I will use the NRSV translation.</p>\n<p>In the Beatitudes as reported in Matthew we read, \u201cBlessed are those who hunger and thirst for righteousness<em>, </em>for they will be filled\u201d (5:6). The Greek word translated as \u201crighteousness\u201d is, again, <em>dikaiosun\u00ea.</em> This translation strikes me as strange. Does one hunger and thirst for a certain character trait? <em>Striving </em>for righteousness, for personal rectitude, that makes sense. But <em>hungering and thirsting for it</em>? One wants to say: \u201cDon\u2019t just hunger and thirst for rectitude; act uprightly.\u201d By contrast: whether justice is present in society is mostly out of one\u2019s control; it depends on what others are doing. That\u2019s why one hungers and thirsts for justice. Jesus is blessing those who hunger and thirst for justice in society.</p>\n<p>In Romans 1:17, Paul states the main theme of the letter that follows: The gospel \u201cis the power of God for salvation to everyone who has faith, to the Jew first and also to the Greek. For in it the <em>dikaiosun\u00ea</em> of God is revealed through faith for faith; as it is written, \u2018The one who is <em>dikaios</em> will live by faith\u2019.\u201d In most commonly used translations, <em>dikaiosun\u00ea </em>is translated as \u201crighteousness\u201d and <em>dikaios</em> as righteous. But when we read the letter that follows, what we learn is that God offers justification impartially to Jews and Greeks alike. \u201cGod shows no partiality\u201d (2:11). To distribute a benefit impartially is to act justly. The main theme of Romans is not about God righteousness \u2013 whatever that might be \u2013 but about God\u2019s justice.<a class=\"anchor\" name=\"note4anc\">\u00a0</a><a class=\"note\" href=\"#note4sym\">[\u00a04\u00a0]</a></p>\n<h2>Two types of justice</h2>\n<p>In one of the Psalms we read:</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>Happy are those who observe justice,<br/>\nwho act rightly at all times (106:3)</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>Happy are those who observe justice,<br/>\nwho act rightly at all times (106:3)</p>\n<p>In the law code delivered by Moses to Israel, and recorded in the Old Testament book of Deuteronomy, we find this passage:</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>You shall appoint judges and officials throughout your tribes, in all your towns that the Lord your God is giving you, and they shall render just decisions for the people. You must not distort justice, you must not show partiality; and you must not accept bribes, for a bribe blinds the eyes of the wise and subverts the cause of those who are in the right.

(16:18-20)</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>You shall appoint judges and officials throughout your tribes, in all your towns that the Lord your God is giving you, and they shall render just decisions for the people. You must not distort justice, you must not show partiality; and you must not accept bribes, for a bribe blinds the eyes of the wise and subverts the cause of those who are in the right. Justice, and only justice, you shall pursue. (16:18-20)</p>\n<p>Moses is clearly referring to a fundamentally different type of justice from that to which the Psalmist is referring. The Psalmist is referring to justice in how we treat others in our ordinary affairs \u2013 justice in how people \u201cconduct their affairs.\u201d \u201cHappy are those who observe justice\u2026at all times.\u201d Moses, by contrast, is referring to justice in judicial proceedings \u2013 the type of justice that becomes relevant when someone has not \u201cconduct[ed] their affairs with justice.\u201d<a class=\"anchor\" name=\"note5anc\">\u00a0</a><a class=\"note\" href=\"#note5sym\">[\u00a05\u00a0]</a></p>\n<p>That there are these two fundamentally different types of justice was noted already by Aristotle. The traditional terms for them are \u201cdistributive justice\u201d and \u201cretributive justice.\u2019 I think neither term is satisfactory. Let me here explain here why I think the term \u201cdistributive justice\u201d is not satisfactory; a bit later I will explain why the term \u201cretributive justice\u201d is not.</p>\n<p>Aristotle held that justice of both types consists of the equitable (fair) distribution of benefits and/or burdens; injustice, of an inequitable distribution. As one would expect, what constitutes equity of distribution has been the subject of extended discussions among philosophers. Aristotle\u2019s idea, in the words of the contemporary American political philosopher Joel Feinberg, was that \u201cjustice requires that relevantly similar cases be treated similarly, and relevantly dissimilar cases be treated dissimilarly in direct proportion to the relevant differences between them.\u201d<a class=\"anchor\" name=\"note6anc\">\u00a0</a><a class=\"note\" href=\"#note6sym\">[\u00a06\u00a0]</a> I have elsewhere argued that there is no one thing, neither equity nor anything else, that accounts for what makes distributions in general just. Distributions are just (and unjust) for a variety of different reasons.</p>\n<p>Be that as it may, the reason I hold that the term \u201cdistributive justice\u201d should be rejected for that type of justice which consists of agents acting justly in their ordinary affairs is that, though such justice is often to be located in how benefits and/or burdens are distributed, that is not always the case. Rape is a profound violation of justice, a profound wrong. But what fundamentally makes it wrong is not that benefits and burdens have been mal-distributed -- though they have been. What makes it wrong is that the victim has been violated, treated with indignity. Another example: suppose the government secretly invades my privacy without warrant. It has violated justice, wronged me. But there has been no distribution of benefits or burdens, and hence no <em>mal</em>-distribution.</p>\n<p>I propose calling the type of justice that consists of agents acting justly in their ordinary affairs, <em>first-order </em>justice: universities treating their support staff justly, teachers and students treating each other justly, banks treating justly people of color who are seeking loans, etc. Justice in the distribution of benefits and/or burdens is one among other forms of first-order justice.</p>\n<p>First-order justice includes both systemic justice and \u201cone off\u201d cases of just action. And the term \u201cagents,\u201d in the formula for first-order justice that I offered above, must be understood as including not only individuals but also social entities such as institutions, organizations, groups, and the like. There is justice and injustice in the relation between banks and corporations, between a coal-burning plant and an asthmatic child in the area, between a Syrian refugee and an affluent European country, between health providers and patients, between states at the center of geopolitics and tiny Pacific island states \u2013 on and on. It\u2019s because social entities can act unjustly and be treated unjustly that they can sue and be sued.<a class=\"anchor\" name=\"note7anc\">\u00a0</a><a class=\"note\" href=\"#note7sym\">[\u00a07\u00a0]</a></p>\n<p>When there has been a violation of first-order justice, there are just and unjust ways of responding to that violation; I shall call just ways of responding, <em>second-order justice</em>. Punishment is a common form of second-order justice; but there are many other forms as well, such as fines, restitution, censure, banishment, reprimands, pardons, and forgiveness. A type of second-order justice that has become popular in the last fifty years or so is so-called <em>restorative justice</em>, this typically including the wrongdoer acknowledging that he did wrong and apologizing, the victim or their representative offering forgiveness in response to the apology, and restitution by the wrongdoer when that is possible</p>\n<p>It is my impression that many people, when they hear the word \u201cjustice,\u201d think primarily, if not exclusively, of second-order justice; they think of police, court proceedings, punishment, prisons, and the like. Second-order justice is obviously of fundamental importance \u2013 not only for its own sake but also because, given our human proclivity for wrongdoing, first-order justice cannot flourish without the support of a just and effective system of second-order justice. A just and effective legal system will institute both a system of laws and sanctions aimed at securing first-order justice among individuals and social entities, including justice in how the state treats its citizens, and a system of laws and procedures aimed at securing a just exercise by the state of second-order justice.</p>\n<p>Though first-order and second-order justice are intertwined, first-order justice is structurally basic in that, if there were no such things as first-order justice and injustice, there would be no such things as second-order justice and injustice. Given this structural connection between the two types of justice, only if one understands first-order justice can one understand second-order justice. For that reason, I will focus my attention, in what follows, on first-order justice. Much of what I say will apply, however, to second-order justice as well.</p>\n<p>Lest my single-minded focus on justice in this essay leave readers with the wrong impression, let me emphasize that loving God above all and one\u2019s neighbor as oneself are fundamental; justice is a component of neighbor-love, not an alternative. Furthermore, not only is justice never the only virtue exercised (or not exercised) in our interactions; acting justly <em>requires</em> the exercise of other virtues. To name just a few: it requires attentiveness to the worth and dignity of others, it requires empathy with the condition of others, it requires humility.</p>\n<h2>What is justice?</h2>\n<p>The biblical writers do not explain what justice is; they assume we understand what they are talking about when they speak of justice. They do not offer a \u201ctheory\u201d of justice. For an explanation of what justice is, a theory, we have to turn to philosophers.<a class=\"anchor\" name=\"note8anc\">\u00a0</a><a class=\"note\" href=\"#note8sym\">[\u00a08\u00a0]</a> Christians will, of course, require of a philosophical theory of justice that it be, among other things, compatible with what the biblical writers say about justice \u2013 and more than compatible, that it illuminate what they say.</p>\n<p>Coming down to us from antiquity are two fundamentally different accounts of what justice is. One comes from Aristotle who, as we saw, explained justice as equity (fairness) in the distribution of benefits and/or burdens.<a class=\"anchor\" name=\"note9anc\">\u00a0</a><a class=\"note\" href=\"#note9sym\">[\u00a09\u00a0]</a> The other comes from the Roman jurist Ulpian (ca. 170-223 CE). Referring to the virtue of being just, Ulpian says that justice (<em>iustitia</em>) is a steady and enduring will to render to each his or her <em>ius</em> (<em>suum ius cuique tribuere</em>).</p>\n<p>How should we translate Ulpian\u2019s term <em>ius </em>into present-day English? A common translation is \u201cright\u201d: justice is rendering to each their right. An alternative translation would be \u201cdue\u201d: justice is rendering to each what is their due. Ulpian\u2019s thought is that the virtue of justice (being just) is a steady and enduring will to render to each what is their right, their due. Justice understood as a state of affairs in society consists, correspondingly, of each individual or social entity rendering to each what they have a right to, what is due them.</p>\n<p>I have already indicated why Aristotle\u2019s account will not do. Not all instances of first-order justice are cases of an equitable distribution of benefits and/or burdens, nor are all instances of injustice cases of an inequitable distribution of benefits and/or burdens. Ulpian seems to me to have gotten it right. All instances of first-order justice are cases of an agent rendering to another what is their right or due; all instances of first-order injustice are cases of an agent not rendering to another their right or due.</p>\n<p>But what are rights, and what accounts for agents having the rights they do have? The answer to this question is a subject of deep controversy among philosophers. To the best of my knowledge, all parties agree that a right is a morally legitimate claim to something; rights are entitlements. And as to what accounts for agents having the rights they do have, all parties agree that individuals possess certain rights because of some official position that the person occupies, that individuals and social entities possess other rights because of some speech act directed toward them, such as a promise, and that individuals and social entities possess yet other rights because they have been conferred, by law or social practice, on all individuals or social entities of a certain standing. My right to a monthly Social Security check from the U.S government is an example of this last sort. Rights of this last sort have traditionally been called <em>positive</em> rights; rights of the other two sorts have no common name. Let me call rights of all three sorts, <em>conferred </em>rights.</p>\n<p>However, by no means are all rights conferred. We have some of our rights just by virtue of being the sort of creature that we are \u2013 a person needing food, clothes, respect, and so forth\u2014and standing in the sort of relations in which we do stand. So what accounts for the fact that one has a <em>non-conferred</em> right to some ways of being treated that would be a good in one\u2019s life whereas, to other such ways, one does not have a right? This, in my judgment, is the most difficult and controversial question that a theory of rights has to face.</p>\n<p>Begin with the fact that what one has a right to is always a good in one\u2019s life, a life-good, never a life-evil. A life-good to which one has a right is, or implies, a way of being treated. That is not always evident on the face of things. My purchase of a ticket gives me the right to a seat on the plane; and that, obviously, is not a way of being treated! However, what\u2019s implied by my right to a seat on the plane is that I have a right to the airline officials <em>permitting</em> me to take a seat on the plane; and that is a way of being treated<em>.</em> The right to free exercise of one\u2019s religion is, similarly, the right to be <em>permitted </em>to exercise one\u2019s religion freely; it is a <em>freedom </em>right, of which there are many others as well: the right to freedom of speech, for example, the right to assemble, to vote, to start a business.</p>\n<p>Though that to which one has a right always is, or implies, some life-good of being treated a certain way, the converse is not the case: there are many ways of being treated that would be a good in one\u2019s life to which one does not have a right.</p>\n<p>A view on the matter that is currently prominent in the literature is that such rights are all either conditions for the enjoyment of, or specifications of, our fundamental non-conferred right to autonomy \u2013 that is, our fundamental non-conferred right to form for ourselves a plan of life and to enact that plan.<a class=\"anchor\" name=\"note10anc\">\u00a0</a><a class=\"note\" href=\"#note10sym\">[\u00a010\u00a0]</a> Popular though this theory is, it has to be rejected. One problem confronting the theory is explaining what that purported non-conferred right to autonomy amounts to. Clearly nobody has the right to do whatever he or she sees fit; so what, then, is that purported right to autonomy? I judge that no autonomy theorist has succeeded in answering this question. But we don\u2019t have to read around in the discussions surrounding the nature of autonomy to see that the theory won\u2019t do. I trust that everybody reading this essay will agree that to torture imprisoned criminals as a way of punishing them is to wrong them; they have a non-conferred right not to be punished by torture. To employ torture as a method of punishment is to treat them unjustly. But what makes it wrong is not that their autonomy is thereby impaired; their autonomy is already impaired; they are locked up. What\u2019s wrong about torturing them, I suggest, is that their dignity as human beings is violated</p>\n<p>And in general, it\u2019s my view, shared by many and explicit in the UN rights documents, that non-conferred rights are grounded in the excellence (goodness, worth, dignity, praise-worthiness) of the rights-bearer. I have a right to the life-good of being treated a certain way ju8st in case, were I not treated that way, I would be treated in a way that does not befit my worth, my dignity, my praiseworthiness. The philosopher Jean Hampton put it well: A person wrongs another, treats them as they have a right not to be treated, \u201cif and only if (while acting as a responsible agent) she treat him in a way that is objectively\u2026demeaning, that is disrespectful of [that person\u2019s] worth.\u201d<a class=\"anchor\" name=\"note11anc\">\u00a0</a><a class=\"note\" href=\"#note11sym\">[\u00a011\u00a0]</a></p>\n<p>Two fundamental facts about human beings is that we all have excellence in certain respects and to certain degrees, and that there are ways of treating us that show due respect for some excellence that we possess, and other ways of treating us that do not show due respect. Non-conferred rights are what respect for excellence requires. For example: if an election official rejects my ballot for the irrelevant reason that my signature did not include my middle name whereas my driver\u2019s license does, I am not being treated with due respect for my being a duly registered adult citizen of the state of Michigan.</p>\n<p>The praiseworthiness that grounds the right to the gold medal of the person who has won the race is an acquired praiseworthiness. But not all rights-grounding excellences are acquired. Some we have on account of some property we naturally possess, such as bearing the image of God, being capable of speech (which grounds one\u2019s right to freedom of speech), and being religious (which grounds one\u2019s right to free exercise of one\u2019s religion). The rights grounded by such excellences have traditionally been called <em>natural </em>rights. An important sub-set of natural rights are <em>human </em>rights \u2013 rights that one has just by virtue of being a human person or human being.<a class=\"anchor\" name=\"note12anc\">\u00a0</a><a class=\"note\" href=\"#note12sym\">[\u00a012\u00a0]</a> An example of an excellence that grounds a natural right that is not a human right is <em>having exceptional mathematical ability.</em> This sort of praiseworthiness is not acquired; the right of such a person to due respect for his mathematical ability is, accordingly, a natural right. But it\u2019s not a right he has just by virtue of being a human. It\u2019s a right he has by virtue of being a particular sort of human; so it\u2019s not a human right. Two excellences of human persons that ground genuinely human rights are the capacity to interpret oneself and the reality in which one finds oneself, including interpreting it religiously, and the capacity to perform an action for the reason that one judges it to be good or obligatory (the Kantian tradition singled out this excellence).<a class=\"anchor\" name=\"note13anc\">\u00a0</a><a class=\"note\" href=\"#note13sym\">[\u00a013\u00a0]</a></p>\n<h2>Why the recognition of rights is important</h2>\n<p>It would be a mistake to move on without taking note of the fact that there is hostility in many quarters nowadays to talk about rights, including Christian quarters. This hostility has many roots, the most common being, so it appears to me, the conviction that rights-talk is made to order for expressing one of the most pervasive and malignant diseases of modern society \u2013 namely, the mentality of possessive individualism. It\u2019s made to order, so it is said, for an \u201centitlement society\u201d such as ours in which individuals place themselves at the center of the moral universe, focusing on their own entitlements to the neglect of their obligations toward others and to the neglect of the cultivation of those virtues that are indispensable for the flourishing of our lives together. It both encourages, and is encouraged by, the possessive individualism of the capitalist economy and the liberal polity. The theologian Joan Lockwood O\u2019Donovan puts the point crisply: \u201cthe modern liberal concept of right belongs to the socially atomistic and disintegrative philosophy of possessive individualism.\u201d<a class=\"anchor\" name=\"note14anc\">\u00a0</a><a class=\"note\" href=\"#note14sym\">[\u00a014\u00a0]</a> To the best of my knowledge, all those who espouse this critique of rights-thought and rights-talk claim, in support of their interpretation of rights, that the idea of natural rights was devised by the secular individualist philosophers of the Enlightenment. The medieval intellectual historian, Brian Tierney, showed decisively in his 1997 publication, <em>The Idea of Natural Rights,</em> that this historical claim is mistaken. He shows that the canon lawyers of the 12th century were explicitly employing the idea. It was from the seedbed of medieval Christendom that the concept of natural rights emerged, not from the 18th century Enlightenment.<a class=\"anchor\" name=\"note15anc\">\u00a0</a><a class=\"note\" href=\"#note15sym\">[\u00a015\u00a0]</a></p>\n<p>No doubt rights-talk is often employed in exactly the way the critic charges. But being employed in this way is not intrinsic to rights-talk; it\u2019s an abuse. Every component of our moral vocabulary is subject to abuse. The correct response to the abuse of some moral concept is not to toss out that concept \u2013 we would have no moral vocabulary left -- but to do what one can to correct the abuse.</p>\n<p>When you and I interact with each other, our normative situation is symmetrical: I have a morally legitimate claim, a right, to being treated in certain ways by you, and you have a morally legitimate claim, a right, to being treated in certain ways by me. One of the respondents to the preview for this essay made this point nicely by saying that we are called to be not only <em>claimants </em>for justice but <em>agents</em> of justice. The possessive individualist employs the language of rights to focus on the former to the neglect of the latter. It\u2019s the mentality of possessive individualism that is the culprit in such cases, not the language of rights. And let\u2019s recall a point made earlier: not only do individuals have rights; social entities such as institutions, organizations, and communities also have rights. My bank can wrong me, but I can also wrong my bank.</p>\n<p>Here is perhaps a good place to note that there is an intrinsic connection between rights and duties (obligations): if you have a right to my treating you a certain way, then I have an obligation to treat you that way; and conversely. Given this correlation, it turns out that justice, on the Ulpian conception, consists equally in agents honoring the rights of others and in agents honoring their duties to others.</p>\n<p>But if rights and duties are correlative in that way, and if rights-talk is often abused in the way indicated, why not eliminate rights-talk from our moral vocabulary and make do with talk about duties, obligations, and responsibilities?</p>\n<p>Certain things of great importance would be lost if we eliminated rights-talk from our moral vocabulary. The moral order has two dimensions, distinct but intimately connected: the <em>agent-dimension</em>, the dimension of what we do, where the language of duty, obligation, responsibility, guilt, etc. are for bringing to speech this dimension of the moral order; and the <em>patient-dimension</em>, the dimension of how we are done unto, where the language of rights, of what is due one, of being wronged, is for bringing to speech this dimension of the moral order. In some situations, it\u2019s important to bring to speech the agent-dimension by speaking of responsibilities; in other situations, it\u2019s important to bring to speech the patient-dimension by speaking of rights.</p>\n<p>Consider the abused wife. With the language of duty, guilt, etc., she can bring to light the agent-dimension of the situation, the moral significance of what her husband is doing. He is failing in his responsibilities to her, his duties; he is guilty. But she cannot bring to light the patient-dimension of the situation, the moral significance of how she is being done unto. For that, she needs the language of rights: she is being wronged, her rights are being violated, she is not being rendered what is due her.</p>\n<p>It\u2019s no accident that all the great social justice movements of the twentieth century, struggling against one or another form of systemic injustice, employed the language of rights: women\u2019s rights, labor rights, civil rights, on and on. It was their use of such language that enabled the members of those movements to bring to speech the moral condition of those who were being systemically wronged.</p>\n<p>There is something else of great importance that would be lost if we eliminated rights-talk from our moral vocabulary. A feature of rights that I have thus far not taken note of is what is sometimes called their <em>trumping </em>force, sometimes, their <em>peremptory </em>force. The idea is this: if you have a right to my treating you a certain way, then, no matter how many good things I might bring about by not treating you that way, I am morally required to treat you that way.</p>\n<p>The best way to see that rights do indeed have this trumping force is to recall the connection, noted above, between rights and duties. If you have a right to my treating you a certain way, then I have an obligation to treat you that way. But if I have an obligation to treat you that way, then I am morally required to treat you that way, <em>period,</em> no matter how many good things I might bring about by not treating you that way. Nothing trumps obligation!</p>\n<p>The twentieth century was rife with authoritarian regimes pursuing policies that they claimed to be for the greater good over the long haul: Hitler, Stalin, Pol Pot, the Afrikaners. If we do not have available to us the language of rights to call attention to the fact that, no matter how much good such policies might bring about, they are nonetheless morally unacceptable because they are trampling on the rights of people, we have no way of putting the brakes on such (self-perceived) benevolence. The point is relevant at the micro-level as well. All too often, benevolence is extended in such a way as to violate the dignity of the recipient; it humiliates. We need the recognition and language of rights for putting a brake on paternalistic benevolence.</p>\n<p>The question has also been raised: can living creatures other than human beings have rights \u2013 animals and plants? When discussing the nature of non-conferred first-order rights I said, with my eye on human beings, that a right one has is always to a way of being treated that would be a good in one\u2019s life \u2013 a life-good.<a class=\"anchor\" name=\"note16anc\">\u00a0</a><a class=\"note\" href=\"#note16sym\">[\u00a016\u00a0]</a> Animals and plants have lives, and there are goods in their lives -- states and happenings in their lives that contribute to their flourishing in their own distinct way, including ways of being treated by human beings that would be goods in their lives.</p>\n<p>At least some of these goods are good in that they contribute to the good of a human being: <em>instrumental</em> goods. Perhaps one thing good about your dog is that it provides you with companionship; that\u2019s an instrumental good. But are animals <em>intrinsically</em> praiseworthy in certain respects, not just instrumentally? My own conviction is that they are. In the opening chapter of the book of <em>Genesis </em>we read that at the end of the sixth day of creation, before the creation of human beings on the seventh day, God stood back, contemplated what had been created, and \u201csaw that it was good.\u201d<a class=\"anchor\" name=\"note17anc\">\u00a0</a><a class=\"note\" href=\"#note17sym\">[\u00a017\u00a0]</a> Aldo Leopold\u2019s <em>A Sand Country Almanac</em><a class=\"anchor\" name=\"note18anc\">\u00a0</a><a class=\"note\" href=\"#note18sym\">[\u00a018\u00a0]</a> is a treasure trove of extraordinarily perceptive celebrations of the praiseworthiness of the wild plants and animals in his surroundings. The question that needs deep reflection, so it seems to me, is not whether animals and plants are intrinsically praiseworthy in certain ways and to certain degrees, but what form due respect for their excellence should take.</p>\n<h2>Justice in the academy</h2>\n<p>It is time that we turned our attention to the role of justice in and by and for the academy, and to the importance of being alert to that role. My discussion will be little more than suggestive. My aim is to point to the pervasive role of justice in the academy and to the pervasive presence of injustice.</p>\n<h3>As an Institution</h3>\n<p>First-order justice pertains to how agents engage each other, how they interact. Teaching is an inherently interactive activity: teachers and students interacting with each other. Scholarship is inherently interactive: scholars interacting with other scholars in their discipline. Academic administration is inherently interactive: administrators interacting with faculty, students, and staff. Laboratory research is interactive. In all these interactions, we are called to act justly -- and to seek the wellbeing of our fellows and institutions in ways that go beyond what justice requires.</p>\n<p>The present-day American academy, for instance, is pervaded by instrumentalist appraisals, that is, appraisals in terms of one or another form of success and failure. What proportion of those who graduate from the college with a pre-med degree are getting into medical school? What proportion of those who graduate from the university with a Ph.D. in English are getting tenure-track positions within a year? How many citations have there been over the past year of publications by members of the philosophy department? Etc. The academy is an arena of success and failure. But it\u2019s also an arena of justice and injustice. And it is at least as important to appraise academic life in terms of justice and injustice, in terms of doing right and being wronged, as it is in terms of success and failure.</p>\n<p>In making such appraisals, it\u2019s imperative that we not only be alert to the racism, sexism, and sexual abuse that pervade the academy but also to justice and injustice in the fine texture of our interactions. Anyone who has participated in the academy for any length of time has heard about, or witnessed, teachers giving unfair tests, teachers humiliating students to whom they have taken a dislike, senior scholars blackmailing young scholars whom they perceive as potential competitors, faculty badmouthing administrators, administrators being rude and heartless to staff. All such actions, and others like them, are instances of injustice, instances of someone being wronged. Those who have heard the biblical call for justice will themselves refrain from all such actions and will seek to halt the injustices they witness.</p>\n<p>Justice pertains not only to interactions within the academy but to interactions of academic institutions, and their faculty and staff, with individuals and social entities outside the academy \u2013 scholars interacting with fund-granting entities and publishers, professors functioning as consultants or as public intellectuals, universities interacting with other universities and with state legislatures, policymakers and international organizations, universities interacting with sports associations \u2013 the list goes on and on.</p>\n<p>Consider research funding and agenda-setting. One of the respondents to the prospectus for this essay wrote, \u201cResearch priorities are skewed.\u2026.Most studies on global health inequality consider unequal health care and socio-economic conditions but neglect inequality in the production of health knowledge\u2026.Conditions common to developed countries garnered more clinical research than those common to less developed countries. Many of the health needs in less developed countries do not attract attention among developed country researchers, who produce the vast majority of global health knowledge.\u201d</p>\n<h3>On Scholarly Frontiers</h3>\n<p>The relevance to the academy of considerations of justice is not limited, however, to how academic institutions and their members treat each other and how they engage with individuals and social entities outside the academy. In many disciplines and areas of inquiry, considerations of justice belong within the subject-matter of the discipline and a scholar\u2019s area of inquiry. This is obvious for those that deal directly with interactions among human beings and social entities, such as economics, political theory, business and management, sociology and social work, health care, gender studies. I say, \u201cThis is obvious.\u201d Apparently it is not obvious to everyone. In the work of a good many scholars in these disciplines, utilitarian considerations of power, efficiency, cost, preference, etc., are so pervasive that justice is never brought into the picture.</p>\n<p>Those who have heard the biblical call for justice will see it as their responsibility to do what they can to resist such reductionism. Those whose specialty is public health will go beyond considerations of cost and efficiency to ask what justice in health care calls for \u2013 attending especially to justice for \u201cthe little ones.\u201d Those whose field is economics will not be content, when appraising the economic health of a society, with determining its GNP but will ask whether that GNP is justly distributed among members of the society. Those who work in the field of education will explore what it is to teach justly, and will ask whether access to quality education is justly distributed within a school district, a city, a county, a state; they too will attend especially to the fate of \u201cthe little ones.\u201d Those who work in political theory and international relations will ask what a just refugee and immigration policy would look like.</p>\n<p>History is both similar to, and different from, the disciplines mentioned above: similar in that it deals directly with interactions among individuals and social entities, different in that it does not make policy suggestions. Historians who have heard the biblical call for justice will not write hagiographical Great Men histories in which the flaws of the \u201cgreat man\u201d are airbrushed away and the fate of \u201cthe little people\u201d ignored. They will show human history for what it is: a mixture of the noble and the ignoble, of the just and the unjust. And they will narrate not only the accomplishments of the elite and powerful but also the lives of the ordinary people.</p>\n<p>A bit of reflection will make clear that considerations of justice are also relevant in disciplines and areas of inquiry that do not deal directly with interactions among human beings and social entities. Architecture, for example. The focus of architecture is on buildings and the space among buildings. But it is human beings interacting with other human beings who design buildings and spaces, deciding, in doing so, for what use and by whom they will be designed and where they will be located. Considerations of justice pervade the practice of architectural design.</p>\n<p>Once buildings have been built, they shape the lives of those who inhabit those buildings and the lives of those who must cope with them. Considerations of justice are relevant at these points as well. Red-lining, zoning, gentrification, and government housing projects, are just four of many examples that could be given of building practices that raise profound issues of justice and injustice.<a class=\"anchor\" name=\"note19anc\">\u00a0</a><a class=\"note\" href=\"#note19sym\">[\u00a019\u00a0]</a></p>\n<p>Engineering and environmental studies raise issues of justice and injustice similar to those raised by architecture. But I must move on. Consider those disciplines and areas of inquiry that deal with arts other than architecture: music, drama, literature, visual art. That considerations of justice are relevant here is even less evident that it was in the case of architecture. But again, a bit of reflection shows that they are.</p>\n<p>Gender and colonialist studies of literature have shown, in recent years, that the worlds projected by literary works \u2013 how characters are portrayed, how society is pictured, etc. \u2013 raise profound issues of justice: gender justice, racial justice, class justice, economic justice, religious justice. Traditional aesthetics, with its exclusive focus on the aesthetic properties of works of art, ignores such issues.</p>\n<p>Add to this that works of art are not just \u201cout there\u201d somewhere. They are made, performed, displayed, and engaged by human beings; and the ways in which they are made, performed, displayed, and engaged perforce raise issues of justice and injustice. Is it just, for example, that only the relatively well-to-do can attend performances of the local symphony, the local opera, and the local choral society? Does injustice lurk behind the fact that so few of the composers who people the canon of Western classical music are women and so few, people of color?</p>\n<p>Let me formulate the principle toward which we have been moving: considerations of justice are relevant to the subject-matter of any discipline or area of inquiry that deals, in whole or in part, either directly or indirectly, with the interactions of human beings and social entities. And that covers most of the disciplines and areas of study in our colleges and universities. It does not cover theoretical natural science as such; but it does cover how physics, chemistry, biology, computer science, etc., are developed, supported, taught, and applied. Neither does it cover mathematics as such; but it does cover how mathematics is developed, supported, taught, and applied.</p>\n<p>When one looks closely at what scholars study and professors teach, one discerns that, outside mathematics and the natural sciences, they all deal, in part at least, directly or indirectly, with interactions among human beings and social entities. Considerations of justice are relevant to all such interactions.</p>\n<p>I wrote the initial draft of this section of my essay on the very same day, July 30, 2020, that the final written words of John Lewis, great American civil rights activist and congressman, appeared in <em>The New York Times </em>(p. A23)<em>. </em>His brief essay included the following words: \u201cI heard the voice of Martin Luther King Jr. on an old radio\u2026.He said it is not enough to say it will get better by and by. He said each of us has a moral obligation to stand up, speak up and speak out. When you see something that is not right, you must say something. You must do something.\u201d<em> </em>King was referring to civil society. His words are as applicable to the academy as they are to civil society.</p>\n<h2>The Scholarly Pursuit of Justice</h2>\n<p>In this essay I have posed many questions that I could not address on this occasion. I have had to skip lightly over the verdant terrain of justice and its role in the academy. Much more could be said. Let me conclude with questions that every scholar might ask that bring the theology and ethics of justice and rights into the fullness of the academy and scholarship.</p>\n<h3>Research and Scholarship</h3>\n<p>Is there any aspect of my current research, writing or academic performance where the question, \u201cIs it just?\u201d, has salience? (e.g., in my scholarly agenda or method or theory I bring to bear on it)</p>\n<p>To what extent does my discipline in general, and my research topic in particular, incorporate interactions between people and/ or groups?</p>\n<p>Are there just or unjust ways that my scholarly products may be applied or utilized?</p>\n<h3>Academic institutions</h3>\n<p>To whom does the scholar in my field owe a duty or obligation? Within the academy and beyond the academy?</p>\n<p>Do my academic practices, or do academic practices in my discipline, give all persons their due, affirming and cultivating their excellence (e.g., in acknowledgements, attributions and citations, authorship, mentorship, collegial support, teaching and training)?</p>\n<p>In my experience, how just are the core institutions of the academy: recruitment of students and faculty, academic governance, scholarly publishing, academic societies, academic award-giving, academic promotion?</p>\n<p>In the interactional spaces of my scholarly field, where is there manifest injustice, i.e., a failure to express love through giving others their due, or enhancing the quality of their \u201clife-worlds?\u201d</p>\n<p>Agencies funding research must establish priorities on topics, research institutions, qualifications of researchers, etc. Are you personally cognizant of what you judge to be injustices in the setting of such priorities?</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<h2 class=\"new_page\">Further reading</h2>\n<p>Emil Brunner, <em>Justice and the Social Order </em>(New York: Harper &amp; Brothers, 1945), for a classic example of a theological account of justice.</p>\n<p>John Finnis, <em>Natural Law and Human Rights </em>(Oxford: Oxford University Press, 1980), for an attempt to ground human rights in natural law.</p>\n<p>Lenn E.

    "bodyText": "As for what I found surprising, let me mention just two things. I was surprised \u2013 amazed, actually \u2013 by the wide range of justice issues highlighted by Allan Bell in his essay, \u201cLinguistic Justice.\u201d Before reading his essay, when thinking about justice and speech I would immediately focus my thoughts on the legal right to free speech; I doubt that I was peculiar in that regard. I now realize what a blinkered view of the matter that was. Bell\u2019s essay opened my eyes to the presence of justice and injustice in who is allowed to speak, and when and where, and what they are allowed to say, to the presence of justice and injustice in which language a group is allowed to use, to the presence of justice and injustice in whose accent is deemed estimable and whose is deemed inferior \u2013 and so forth, on and on.\n\nAnother thing that surprised me was a comment by Christopher Hays in his essay, \u201cThe Obligations of Justice for Colombia\u2019s Displaced Persons.\u201d After noting that \u201crights language is pervasive\u201d in Colombia, Hays writes: \u201cThe emphasis on rights has fostered a great deal of passivity.\u201d He explains that \u201cgovernment is seen as the primary. . . restorer of violated rights\u201d \u2013 in spite of the fact that the government of Colombia is incapable of doing so \u2013 and that individuals exercise little agency in the matter. Hays\u2019 comment jolted me into realizing that, before reading his essay, I had rather thoughtlessly assumed that a group\u2019s recognition that its rights are being violated is a spur to action \u2013 as it was, for example, in the American civil rights movement. I now see that it might instead motivate the opposite response, passivity. \u201cIt\u2019s not up to us to correct the situation; we\u2019ll just put up with it.\u201c The passivity might or might not be accompanied by a sense of grievance, or by sly sullen resistance.\n\nComing down to us from antiquity are two fundamentally different accounts of what justice is. One comes from Aristotle who. . . explained justice as equity (fairness) in the distribution of benefits and/or burdens. The other comes from the Roman jurist Ulpian. Referring to the virtue of being just, Ulpian says that justice is a steady and enduring will to render to each his or her jus .\n\nThe standard translations of jus are \u201cright\u201d or \u201cdue.\u201d In my brief, what followed the passage just quoted were reasons for preferring Ulpian\u2019s account to Aristotle\u2019s.\n\nI now think that what I said was incorrect. Antiquity did not bequeath to us two distinct accounts of what justice is. Aristotle, in his discussion of justice in the Nicomachean Ethics, does not say what justice is ; he does not say what constitutes justice. What he does, instead, is offer a general characterization of those situations in which justice is present: justice is present, he says, when benefits and/or burdens (goods and/or harms) are distributed equitably. That general characterization is compatible with Ulpian\u2019s account of what justice is . One might hold that, in general, what persons have a right to is that they be treated equitably in the distribution of benefits and/or burdens.\n\nIn interpreting, as I now do, the relation between what Aristotle and Ulpian said about justice, I am following in the footsteps of Thomas Aquinas. Aquinas was, of course, profoundly influenced in his thought by Aristotle. Given that fact, and given that Aristotle nowhere says or suggests that justice consists of being rendered what is one\u2019s right or due, one wonders whether, perhaps, the Ulpian account of justice is missing in Aquinas. It is not. Aquinas remarks that \u201cjustice denotes a kind of equality\u201d ( S. Th. II-II 57, 1; see also II-II 58, 2 and 59, 2). But it\u2019s clear that he did not regard that as an explanation of what justice is. For when he asks, in S. Th. II-I, 58, 1, \u201cwhat is justice,\u201d how \u201cjustice is fittingly defined,\u201d his answer is that justice is \u201crendering to each his right. . . . A man is said to be just because he respects the rights [ jura ] of others.\u201d Aquinas goes on to say that justice can also be defined as rendering to each \u201c what is his\u201d or \u201cwhat is due to him\u201d ( S. Th. II-II 58, 11).\n\nShortly after Justinian became ruler of the Byzantine Empire in 527 C.E., he ordered the preparation of three compilations of Roman law: the Codex , which collected the legal pronouncements of the Roman emperors, the Institutes , a beginning student\u2019s handbook, and the Digest , which culled and organized everything of value from earlier Roman law. The Digest opened with Ulpian\u2019s definition of \u201cjustice.\u201d\n\nThe Digest was the largest of the three texts, and proved to be by far the most influential. Its influence on the subsequent legal tradition of Christendom was enormous; it became its fundamental legal text. In offering Ulpian\u2019s explanation of what justice is, Aquinas was reflecting the influence of Justinian\u2019s Digest.\n\nI know of no writers who explicitly contest Ulpian\u2019s account of justice in terms of rendering to one\u2019s fellows their right or due. Some of those who write about justice pay no attention to the connection between justice and rights. Some argue that there are no natural rights, only conferred rights \u2013 that is, rights conferred on us by some action, such as a promise performed by an individual, or a legislative act performed by an authority. [\u00a01\u00a0] And some hold that thought and talk about rights is so seriously abused in the modern world that we should forego such thought and talk. But to the best of my knowledge, no one explicitly contests Ulpian\u2019s thought that justice \u2013 in contrast, say, to benevolence \u2013 consists of rendering to each their right, what they have a right to, what is due them, what would wrong them if they were denied it.\n\nA parenthetical note: it\u2019s unfortunate that English does not enable us to translate Ulpian\u2019s maxim with a pair of nouns like the Latin pair justitia and jus ; we have to translate jus with terms that have no linguistic relation to the term \u201cjustice,\u201d such as \u201cright\u201d and \u201cdue.\u201d The closest we can come in English to the linguistic pairing available in Latin is this: \u201djustice is rendering to each what is justly theirs.\u201d\n\nThe biblical writers do not explain what justice is; they assume we know what they are talking about when they speak of justice. They do not offer a \u201ctheory\u201d of justice. For an explanation of what justice is, a theory, we have to turn to philosophers.\n\nI then launched into my discussion of Aristotle and Ulpian.\n\nSome respondents found this transition problematic. When I said that the biblical writers do not offer a theory of justice, I had, in the back of my mind, an observation by the Old Testament scholar, Walter Brueggemann, that the dominant overarching character of \u201cIsrael\u2019s speech about God is that of testimony\u201d ( Theology of the Old Testament, 119). Testimony is obviously different from theory.\n\nNone of the respondents argued, to the contrary, that the biblical writers do offer a theory of justice. But the passage gave some the impression of suggesting that, for the purpose of understanding justice, we can leave Scripture behind and turn to philosophers. They found this suggestion problematic \u2013 rightly so. One respondent wondered \u201cwhether there is not a distinctly biblical concept of justice.\u201d\n\nI don\u2019t think there is a distinct concept of justice in Scripture \u2013 not, at least, if one understands the term \u201cconcept\u201d as philosophers understand it, namely, as the sort of thing one would find in a dictionary\u2019s definition of the term. But there is a distinct understanding of justice in Scripture, a distinct way of thinking about justice. So let me now flesh out that understanding beyond the little I said in the brief, identifying what I see as salient features of the biblical understanding of justice. There are other understandings of justice that share some of the features of the biblical understanding; but when we put all the features of the biblical understanding together, the result is highly distinctive.\n\n\u201cI the Lord love justice,\u201d writes the prophet Isaiah (61:8). And in a well-known passage the prophet Micah writes:\n\nThe Lord has told you, O mortal, what is good, and what does the Lord require of you but to do justice, and to love kindness, and to walk humbly with your God (6:8).\n\nPlato\u2019s Republic is an extended dialogue on justice; Aristotle\u2019s Nicomachean Ethics includes an extended discourse on justice. In neither of these is there any mention of divinity; the accounts offered are purely secular. The biblical understanding of justice is an intrinsically theological understanding. God is up-front-center.\n\nAs Osam Temple notes in his response, \u201cthere can be justice without love. . . . You can do justice not out of conviction but out of fear of the law and punishment.\u201d On the biblical understanding of justice, doing justice is both required by love and to be an exercise of love.\n\nThe English word \u201clove\u201d denotes a rather wide variety of different phenomena (see Chapter One of my United in Love ). The love of neighbor that Jesus enjoins on us \u2013 agap\u00ea \u2013consists of seeking the good of the neighbor. Being treated justly is, obviously, a good in one\u2019s life. Though agapic love of neighbor often goes beyond doing what justice requires, it never falls short of doing what justice requires. It never perpetrates injustice.\n\nShalom, often rendered as \u201cpeace\u201d in English translations, is better translated as \u201cwell-being\u201d or \u201cflourishing.\u201d Shalom consists of flourishing in all dimensions of one\u2019s existence: in one\u2019s relation to God, to one\u2019s fellow human beings, to the natural world, to human artifacts, to oneself. The thought of the writers was that insofar as one is a victim of injustice, one is not fully flourishing \u2013 even if, for some reason, one is content with one\u2019s condition. Though true and full shalom goes beyond what justice requires \u2013 a just community might suffer from famine caused by drought, and thus not experience shalom \u2013 justice is a condition of shalom. Justice is, as it were, the ground floor of shalom.\n\nLuke writes that shortly after Jesus began speaking in public, he attended the synagogue in Nazareth on a Sabbath and was invited to read Scripture and comment on what he read. He was handed the scroll of the prophet Isaiah, unrolled it, and read the following:\n\nThe Spirit of the Lord is upon me, because he has anointed me to bring good news to the poor. He has sent me to proclaim release to the captives and recovery of sight to the blind, to let the oppressed go free, to proclaim the year of the Lord.\n\nLuke reports that Jesus then rolled up the scroll, gave it back to the attendant, and sat down. \u201cThe eyes of all were fixed on him,\u201d writes Luke, expecting him to offer some commentary on what he had read. Jesus then said, \u201cToday this scripture has been fulfilled in your hearing.\u201d\n\nWhat Luke reported Jesus as reading was an adaptation of the opening verses of Isaiah 61, a passage that is a close parallel of a passage a few chapters earlier in which the prophet spoke explicitly of God\u2019s call for justice:\n\nIs this not the fast that I choose, to loose the bonds of injustice, to undo the thongs of the yoke, to let the oppressed go free and to break every yoke? (58:6-7)\n\nThe import of Jesus\u2019s declaration, \u201cToday this scripture has been fulfilled in your hearing,\u201d is unmistakable. Jesus identified himself as the one anointed by the Spirit of the Lord to proclaim the coming of justice in the year of the Lord\u2019s favor (the Year of Jubilee).\n\nIn Matthew\u2019s gospel, Jesus has already been teaching and healing for some time when the gospel writer intrudes himself into the narrative to offer his interpretation of Jesus\u2019 identity \u2013 the same interpretation as that which Jesus himself offered in the synagogue. Jesus is \u201cto fulfill what had been spoken through the prophet Isaiah,\u201d namely,\n\nI will put my Spirit upon him, and he will proclaim justice [ krisis ] to the Gentiles\u2026 He will not break a bruised reed Or quench a smoldering wick Until he brings justice [ krisis ] to victory. (12:17-20)\n\nThat is, justice and injustice in the laws and social practices of Israel. When condemning injustice, they seldom mention individual wrongdoers. The prophet Micah is typical:\n\nThe official and the judge ask for a bribe, and the powerful dictate what they desire; thus they pervert justice. (7:1)\n\nSo striking is this that one is compelled to ask \u201cWhy? What does it mean?\u201d\n\nA number of South American theologians, writing in the 60s and 70s of the last century, suggested that the emphasis on the quartet of the vulnerable has theological significance; it is, they said, an indication of what they called \u201cGod\u2019s preferential option for the poor.\u201d\n\nThis suggestion did not sit well with a good many North American Christians: \u201cDoesn\u2019t God love everybody alike, rich as well as poor?\u201d The answer, surely, is yes; God loves all those who bear God\u2019s image, rich and poor alike. But why then is it the case, as it clearly is in the biblical testimony, that God has a preferential option for the poor \u2013 or more precisely, for the vulnerable?\n\nNowhere in Plato\u2019s long dialogue about justice in the Republic does he make reference to the vulnerable in Athens. The reason he does not is that he is articulating principles of justice for an ideal society. [\u00a03\u00a0] The biblical writers held out the hope for a messianic age; that is the form the ideal society took for them. But when they speak about justice, their eye is seldom on justice in the messianic age; almost always it is on justice and injustice in this present, far-from-ideal, age. They represent God as working to redeem humankind, and the cosmos in general, from fallenness, and as calling us to share in this cause.\n\nThose who seek the undoing of social injustice must set priorities. No doubt the wealthy and the powerful in Israel were sometimes victims of injustice, as they are in our present-day society \u2013 victims of episodes of injustice. The injustice experienced by the widows, the orphans, the sojourners, and the impoverished in ancient Israel was not episodes of injustice but the daily condition of injustice. It\u2019s because the biblical God is a redeeming God that there is, in God, a preferential option for the vulnerable \u2013 an option that we are to imitate.\n\nThe vulnerable today include many more than the biblical quartet \u2013 prisoners, for example. In his response, Terry Halliday forcefully reminds us that they also include refugees and asylum seekers. I write these words two weeks after Russia invaded Ukraine. Today\u2019s edition of the New York Times reports that already more than 2 million Ukrainians have fled as refugees to neighboring countries.\n\nThe opening verses of Psalm 72 present a picture of the good king.\n\nGive the king your justice, O God, and your doing right to the king\u2019s son. May he judge your people rightly, and your poor with justice\u2026. May he defend the cause of the poor of the people, give deliverance to the needy and crush the oppressor. [\u00a04\u00a0]\n\nIn the thirteenth chapter of his letter to the Romans, Paul repeats this understanding of the task of government, though less expansively: \u201cthe governing authority. . . is God\u2019s servant for your good. . . . It is the servant of God to execute wrath on the wrongdoer.\u201d\n\nIn his book Republican Theology: The Civil Religion of American Evangelicals, Benjamin T. Lynerd shows, with impressive documentation, that over the past century the dominant view among American evangelicals concerning the task of government was that its main task is to secure individual liberty. In the writings that he quotes, there is rarely any mention of justice. This is a sharp departure from the biblical understanding. Securing justice does often require securing individual liberty; but they are not the same. Liberty without justice is freedom for the lions and eagles of the world to seek their prey.\n\nThe psalmist says:\n\nAscribe to the Lord, O families of peoples, ascribe to the Lord glory and honor. Ascribe to the Lord the glory due his name. (96:7-8)\n\nAnd in another passage:\n\nPraise is due to you, O God in Zion, and to you shall vows be performed. (65:1)\n\nThis theme is echoed in many Christian liturgies. To cite just one example: in The Holy Eucharist: Rite One of the Episcopal Church, the Great Thanksgiving begins with the following words, spoken by the celebrant:\n\nIt is very meet, right, and our bounden duty, that we should at all times, and in all places, give thanks unto Thee, O Lord, holy Father, almighty everlasting God. [\u00a05\u00a0]\n\nAs I mentioned at the beginning of this section, some of the features salient in the biblical understanding of justice can also be found in other understandings of justice. But nowhere else is there anything like the complete biblical understanding. It is unique.\n\nThese respondents are correct in noting that, apart from a short discussion of the relation between justice and love, the brief did not place justice within the context of the good and moral life generally; they are also correct in claiming that not doing so runs the danger of encouraging a myopic concern with justice. So let me now make some remarks on the relation of justice to other components of the good and moral life.\n\nUlpian\u2019s formula, from which I took my lead, was a definition of the virtue justitia: justitia is a steady and enduring will to render to each their jus. In my brief I focused my attention not on that virtue but on the action which the virtue actualizes. I asked, what constitutes rendering to each their jus ? What constitutes acting justly ? The action has explanatory priority over the virtue: to explain what the virtue is, one has to know what the action is.\n\nThe virtue is obviously important, however. If there were not, in the members of society, the virtue of a \u201csteady and enduring will\u201d to treat each other justly, just action would be, at best, a haphazard and fortuitous thing.\n\nThe English term \u201cjustice,\u201d unlike the Latin jusititia, does not name a virtue. It\u2019s the term \u201cbeing just\u201d that names the virtue. For justice to prevail in society, the virtue of being just must prevail.\n\nThe virtue of being just cannot be exercised all by itself, however; it requires the exercise of a range of other virtues. It requires, above all, a certain kind of humility, a humility which takes the form of decentering, of being attentive to the dignity, the praiseworthiness, of the other person. Typically such decentering requires a willingness to listen to the other person, to listen to their story. Being just also requires the virtues of empathy and anger: empathy with victims of injustice, anger at the perpetrators. And very often it requires the virtue of having overcome prejudices of various sorts: prejudice against members of another race, against members of another religion, against members of another political party, against speakers of another language, against persons who are obese, on and on.\n\nNot only does exercising the virtue of being just require the exercise of many other virtues. Sometimes just action consists of exercising some other virtue. For example, sometimes treating the other person justly requires telling them the truth; the person who is not in the habit of truth-telling will often act unjustly. Sometimes treating the other person justly does not just require listening to them but consists of listening to them.\n\nAnd sometimes the exercise of some other virtue, or the pursuit of some other value, requires exercising the virtue of being just. Friendship is a good example of the point. Though friendship, obviously, does not consist of treating each other justly it certainly doing so.\n\nThe example of friendship suggests a general point. Not only is it important to note the intricate intertwinement of being just and acting justly with other virtues and values. Acting justly and being treated justly are but two of the innumerable multiplicity of things that are of value in our human existence: a home of one\u2019s own, surroundings in which one can take aesthetic delight, awe before the unfathomable intricacy and immensity of God\u2019s creation, gratitude. The list has no end.\n\nSome of the respondents expressed uneasiness with the prominence of rights in my discussion. In my brief I observed that uneasiness with, and hostility toward, rights-talk are widespread, and I addressed what I saw as the root of this uneasiness or hostility. This is part of what I wrote:\n\nThis hostility has many roots, the most common being, so it appears to me, the conviction that rights-talk is made to order for expressing one of the most pervasive and malignant diseases of modern society, namely, the mentality of possessive individualism. It\u2019s made to order, so it is said, for an \u201centitlement society,\u201d such as ours in which individuals place themselves at the center of the moral universe, focusing on their own entitlements to the neglect of the cultivation of those virtues that are indispensable for the flourishing of our lives together. . . . The theologian Joan Lockwood O\u2019Donovan puts the point crisply: \u201cthe modern liberal concept of rights belongs to the socially atomistic and disintegrative philosophy of possessive individualism.\u201d\n\nI went on to argue that the preoccupation of the possessive individualist with claiming his own rights is an abuse of rights-talk. When I am in the presence of another, not only do I have rights vis-\u00e0-vis the other person; she has rights vis-a-vis me. All components of our moral vocabulary are subject to abuse. When confronted with such abuse, one does not argue for eliminating that component of our moral vocabulary; one does what one can to combat the abuse.\n\nI now think that this response, though not mistaken, is not entirely adequate. It appears to me that not all of those who feel uneasy with, or hostile to, rights-talk, have their eye on the malign influence of the \u201cphilosophy of possessive individualism.\u201d They do not all have their eye on the abuse of rights-talk by possessive individualists. Rather, so it appears to me, a good many of them, when thinking of rights, think primarily of claiming rights ; and they are convinced that claiming rights \u2013 whether the claim is made by oneself or another person \u2013 is incompatible with, and intrinsically inferior morally to, the \u201cbeing-for-the-other\u201d (Karl Barth\u2019s words) which Jesus enjoined in his second love-command \u2013 and also incompatible with, and morally inferior to, attending to one\u2019s responsibilities toward the other.\n\nPart of my response to this analysis is similar to my response to the previous analysis: just as it is a mistake to focus just on the abuse of rights-talk by possessive individualists, so also it is a mistake, when thinking of rights, to think primarily of claiming rights. Rights are not only to be claimed, they are also to be acknowledged . Rights-talk is not only for claiming rights but also for acknowledging rights.\n\nLet me take the argument a step further. Jesus\u2019 second love-command was not \u201cLove your neighbor.\u201d It was \u201cLove your neighbor as yourself\u201d (quoting Leviticus 19:18). It was, to adapt Barth, \u201cBe for the other as you are for yourself.\u201d The command implies the moral propriety of well-ordered self-regard \u2013 the moral propriety of well-ordered self-love. Speaking up for one\u2019s own rights, claiming them, out of well-ordered self-regard, is not intrinsically inferior morally to acknowledging the rights of others.\n\nIt\u2019s true that to forego claiming certain of one\u2019s rights, to forego speaking up for them, is sometimes the right thing to do. But the person who thinks she has no right to claim her own rights \u2013 worse yet, the person who thinks she has no rights \u2013 is morally defective in a deep and profound way, perhaps through no fault of her own. She fails to recognize that she too has dignity, that she too has worth that calls to be honored. In my brief I remarked that all the great social justice movements of the twentieth century employed the language of rights. In doing so, the members of those movements were giving voice to their recognition that they too had dignity.\n\nOf course, it remains the case that not all rights-claims are true; a good many are false. But the same is the case for duty-claims; many of those too are false. The husband who tells his abused wife that she has a duty to submit is speaking falsehood.\n\nResponding to some questions raised about rights requires that I expand on what I said in the brief about the nature of rights and the relation of rights to duties.\n\nA number of scholars noted that rights sometimes conflict, and asked what we are to make of that. Some writers on these matters have suggested that this is a reason for rejecting the very idea of rights; the idea, they say, is incoherent.\n\nObligations conflict in the same way that rights conflict. In Plato\u2019s Republic , Socrates offers the example of someone who has promised to return in due time a weapon that he borrowed from a friend. The friend, in the meantime, has gone mad and is likely to use the weapon to harm himself or others. The borrower has an obligation to keep his promise; but he also has an obligation not to put a dangerous weapon in the hands of someone who is likely to use it to harm someone. Conflicting obligations.\n\nThe standard way in which philosophers deal with such conflicts is by distinguishing between prima facie duties and all-things-considered duties \u2013 the latter typically called ultima facie or pro tanto duties. Prima facie duties do, indeed, often conflict. But it is the view of most philosophers that all-things-considered duties do not conflict. If one considers just the promise the person made to return the weapon to his friend, he ought to do that; that is his prima facie duty. If one considers just putting a dangerous weapon in the hands of someone who has lost his sanity, he ought not to do that; that is his prima facie duty. Two conflicting prima facie duties or obligations. But if one asks what he ought to do all things considered , it seems clear that all-things-considered he ought to prevent his friend from harming himself or others by not keeping his promise to return the weapon. That is his ultima facie obligation. No conflict.\n\nAlong the same lines, we should distinguish prima facie rights from ultima facie ( pro tanto ) rights. If we consider just the promise made, the friend has a prima face right to the borrower keeping his promise by returning the weapon. If we consider just putting a dangerous weapon in the hands of someone who has gone insane, the friend has a prima facie right to the borrower not putting a dangerous weapon in his hands. Two conflicting prima facie rights. But all things considered, surely the friend has a right to the borrower breaking his promise and not putting a dangerous weapon in his hands. That is his ultima facie right. No conflict.\n\nFrom these observations about the nature of rights let\u2019s move on to some points about the relation of rights to duties. In my brief, I affirmed a principle of correlation between rights and duties (obligations). Here is how I stated the principle: if you have a right to my treating you a certain way, then I have an obligation to treat you that way, and conversely.\n\nThis way of stating the principle fails to take account of third-party duties and rights. Rather than its being my duty to treat you a certain way, it may be my duty to you to treat Malchus a certain way. Correspondingly, rather than your having a right to my treating you a certain way, you may have a right to my treating Malchus a certain way. Taking account of third-party duties and rights, the way to state the principle of correlatives is this: If I have a duty to you to treat X a certain way, then you have a right to my treating X that way, and conversely.\n\nAn objection one sometimes hears to the existence of so-called benefit rights is that often it is impossible to specify a party responsible for honoring the right. Suppose, for example, that in a well-to-do modern society everybody has a right to adequate health care. If so, who is responsible for honoring that right? The question appears to have no answer. The principle of correlatives appears not to hold. Permission rights are different. If I have a right to assemble with others for religious worship, then everybody has a duty to permit me to assemble.\n\nHere, too, thinking about duties helps us to get clear about rights. Immanuel Kant introduced the idea of what he called imperfect duties. An imperfect duty is a duty to treat someone or other a certain way without there being anyone such that it is one\u2019s duty to treat them that way. Many duties of charity are like that. I may have a duty to extend a certain kind of charity to someone or other without there being anyone such that it is my duty to extend that charity to them. I am free to choose.\n\nI suggest that we think of rights along the same lines. Just as there are imperfect duties, so too there are imperfect rights: the right to be treated a certain way by someone or other without there being anyone such that one has the right to be treated that way by them . Again, charity offers familiar examples. The beggar has a right to someone or other alleviating his need; if no one did, he would be wronged. But there may be no one such that he has the right to that person alleviating his need. The right to adequate health care is like that \u2013 a genuine right, albeit an imperfect right.\n\nReturn to the principle of correlatives between duties and rights. With that principle in mind, a natural question to ask concerning my analysis of justice \u2013 and a question some respondents did ask \u2013 is this: if duties and rights really are correlated in the way indicated, why not work out an account of justice in terms of duties rather than in terms of rights?\n\nIt\u2019s a question I have never previously considered, and I don\u2019t feel entirely satisfied with my answer. I think it is the influence on me, and on most other writers in the West, of Ulpian\u2019s formula, transmitted to us by way of Justinian\u2019s Digest. Ulpian did not explain justitia as the steady and enduring will to treat others as one ought to treat them. He explained justitia as the steady and enduring will to treat others as they have a right to be treated. Justitia is explained not in terms of an agent\u2019s obligations but in terms of a recipient\u2019s rights. The Latin pair, justitia and jus, made this formula compelling.\n\nWe have all followed in Ulpian\u2019s footsteps, connecting justice to rights rather than to obligations, doing so in spite of the principle of correlatives. I don\u2019t know what a theory of justice developed in terms of duties rather than rights would look like. Perhaps not much different. Possibly quite different.\n\nAn important, recently published, book directly relevant to our discussion is The Blessings of Liberty: Human Rights and Religious Freedom in the Western Legal Tradition, by the legal historian John Witte. [\u00a06\u00a0] In my brief I wrote that it is commonly said, by secular and Christian writers alike, that \u201cthe idea of natural rights was devised by the secular individualist philosophers of the Enlightenment, and that it continues to carry the DNA of its origins.\u201d Secular writers who tell this story about origins typically praise the idea on account of its origins; Christian writers who tell the story invariably condemn the idea for the same reason. I went on to note that \u201cthe medieval intellectual historian, Brian Tierney, showed decisively in his 1997 publication, The Idea of Natural Rights, that this historical clam is mistaken. He shows that the canon lawyers of the 12 th century were explicitly employing the idea of natural rights.\u201d\n\nI predict that The Blessings of Liberty will prove to be the decisive treatment of the matter. Based on a lifetime of scholarship, Witte goes far beyond Tierney\u2019s focus on the medieval period to tell the story of human rights and religious freedom from their earliest appearance in the Western legal tradition up to the present. [\u00a07\u00a0] Summarizing his treatment of the early modern period, Witte writes, \u201cearly modern Protestant theologians and jurists on both sides of the Atlantic expounded complex theories of natural law and natural rights\u201d (76). And summarizing his opening discussion of Roman and medieval jurisprudence he writes, \u201cFor Western jurists and judges, rights-talk was a common way to define and defend the law\u2019s protection, support, limitations, and entitlements of persons and groups in society as well as the proper relationships between political and other authorities and their respective subjects. For Western lawyers, subjective rights were not a modern invention. . . . Lawyers since classical Roman and medieval times used rights ideas and terms. . . \u201d (72). The Blessings of Liberty should put to rest once and for all the claim that the idea of natural rights was an invention of the secular philosophers of the Enlightenment.\n\nIn my 2019 publication, Religion in the University , [\u00a08\u00a0] I defend the thesis, against a number of objections, that religious voices have a place in the modern university. The argument remains purely abstract, of course, if it turns out that religious people have nothing significant to say on matters relevant to the academy, or if they remain silent because they feel insecure or intimidated. The project of the Global Faculty Initiative is to encourage and enhance the Christian voice on topics that are, or should be, of concern to the academy. Among those topics is justice, both within the academy and outside.\n\n[\u00a01\u00a0] Those who argue that there are no natural rights typically do not think of them as non-conferred rights \u2013 which I judge is how we ought to think of them. They think of them, for example, as rights that we would have in a Lockean state of nature. They then argue that there can be no such thing as a state of nature.\n\n[\u00a02\u00a0] In his response titled \u201cThe Justice of God,\u201d Brendan Case very perceptively analyses some puzzles concerning the justice of God. The Hebrew Bible/ Old Testament book of Joshua is often cited as a prime example of the injustice of Israel\u2019s God. In my essay \u201cReading Joshua\u201d I argued that when the genre of Joshua is rightly understood, the book is not a (purported) record of God\u2019s instructing Israel to engage in the genocide of the Palestinians. (The essay is published in M. Bergmann, M.J. Murray, and M.C. Rea (eds.) The Moral Character of the God of Abraham [Oxford U. Press, 2011].)\n\n[\u00a03\u00a0] The highly influential book of the contemporary political philosopher John Rawls, A Theory of Justice, is also a theory of justice for an ideal society.\n\n[\u00a04\u00a0] Where I have \u201cdoing right\u201d and \u201crightly,\u201d the NRSV has \u201crighteousness.\u201d The prayer is not that the king and his son have the character trait of righteousness but that they do the right thing.\n\n[\u00a05\u00a0] Many additional examples can be found in the Eucharistic prayers collected by Lucien Deiss in The Springtime of the Liturgy and in those collected by Jasper and Cuming in Prayers of the Eucharist: Early and Reformed.\n\n[\u00a06\u00a0] Cambridge: Cambridge University Press, 2022.\n\n[\u00a07\u00a0] What Witte calls \u201chuman rights\u201d are what I have been calling \u201cnatural rights.\u201d\n\n[\u00a08\u00a0] New Haven: Yale University Press.",
    "bodyHtml": "<p>As for what I found surprising, let me mention just two things. I was surprised \u2013 amazed, actually \u2013 by the wide range of justice issues highlighted by Allan Bell in his essay, \u201cLinguistic Justice.\u201d Before reading his essay, when thinking about justice and speech I would immediately focus my thoughts on the legal right to free speech; I doubt that I was peculiar in that regard. I now realize what a blinkered view of the matter that was. Bell\u2019s essay opened my eyes to the presence of justice and injustice in who is allowed to speak, and when and where, and what they are allowed to say, to the presence of justice and injustice in which language a group is allowed to use, to the presence of justice and injustice in whose accent is deemed estimable and whose is deemed inferior \u2013 and so forth, on and on.</p>\n<p>Another thing that surprised me was a comment by Christopher Hays in his essay, \u201cThe Obligations of Justice for Colombia\u2019s Displaced Persons.\u201d After noting that \u201crights language is pervasive\u201d in Colombia, Hays writes: \u201cThe emphasis on rights has fostered a great deal of passivity.\u201d He explains that \u201cgovernment is seen as the primary. . . restorer of violated rights\u201d \u2013 in spite of the fact that the government of Colombia is incapable of doing so \u2013 and that individuals exercise little agency in the matter. Hays\u2019 comment jolted me into realizing that, before reading his essay, I had rather thoughtlessly assumed that a group\u2019s recognition that its rights are being violated is a spur to action \u2013 as it was, for example, in the American civil rights movement. I now see that it might instead motivate the opposite response, passivity. \u201cIt\u2019s not up to us to correct the situation; we\u2019ll just put up with it.\u201c The passivity might or might not be accompanied by a sense of grievance, or by sly sullen resistance.</p>\n<p>In this essay I propose responding to a number of the questions raised and points made in the responses to my theology brief, mainly to the extended responses, but also to some of the earlier brief responses. I propose doing six things. First, correcting something I said in my theology brief about the origins in antiquity of our way of thinking about justice. Second, addressing the question, posed by a couple of respondents, whether there is a distinct biblical concept of justice. Third, addressing concerns about my single-minded focus on justice, to the ignoring of other components of the moral and good life. Fourth, addressing the uneasiness about rights-talk felt by some respondents. Fifth, responding to questions of several respondents about rights by amplifying what I said about the nature of rights and the relation of rights to duties. And finally, calling attention to a recent publication on the history of the idea of natural rights.</p>\n<h2>A Correction</h2>\n<p>In my Theology Brief I wrote the following:</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>Coming down to us from antiquity are two fundamentally different accounts of what justice is. One comes from Aristotle who. . . explained justice as equity (fairness) in the distribution of benefits and/or burdens. The other comes from the Roman jurist Ulpian. Referring to the virtue of being just, Ulpian says that justice is a steady and enduring will to render to each his or her <i>jus</i>.</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>Coming down to us from antiquity are two fundamentally different accounts of what justice is. One comes from Aristotle who. . . explained justice as equity (fairness) in the distribution of benefits and/or burdens. The other comes from the Roman jurist Ulpian. Referring to the virtue of being just, Ulpian says that justice is a steady and enduring will to render to each his or her <i>jus</i>.</p>\n<p>The standard translations of <i>jus </i>are \u201cright\u201d or \u201cdue.\u201d In my brief, what followed the passage just quoted were reasons for preferring Ulpian\u2019s account to Aristotle\u2019s.</p>\n<p>I now think that what I said was incorrect. Antiquity did not bequeath to us two distinct accounts of what justice is. Aristotle, in his discussion of justice in the <i>Nicomachean Ethics, </i>does not say what justice <i>is</i>; he does not say what <i>constitutes </i>justice. What he does, instead, is offer a general characterization of those situations in which justice is present: justice is present, he says, when benefits and/or burdens (goods and/or harms) are distributed equitably. That general characterization is compatible with Ulpian\u2019s account of what justice <i>is</i>. One might hold that, in general, what persons have a right to is that they be treated equitably in the distribution of benefits and/or burdens.</p>\n<p>In interpreting, as I now do, the relation between what Aristotle and Ulpian said about justice, I am following in the footsteps of Thomas Aquinas. Aquinas was, of course, profoundly influenced in his thought by Aristotle. Given that fact, and given that Aristotle nowhere says or suggests that justice consists of being rendered what is one\u2019s right or due, one wonders whether, perhaps, the Ulpian account of justice is missing in Aquinas. It is not. Aquinas remarks that \u201cjustice denotes a kind of equality\u201d (<i>S. Th. </i>II-II 57, 1; see also II-II 58, 2 and 59, 2). But it\u2019s clear that he did not regard that as an explanation of what justice is. For when he asks, in <i>S. Th.</i> II-I, 58, 1, \u201cwhat is justice,\u201d how \u201cjustice is fittingly defined,\u201d his answer is that justice is \u201crendering to each his right. . . . A man is said to be just because he respects the rights [<i>jura</i>] of others.\u201d Aquinas goes on to say that justice can also be defined as rendering to each \u201c what is his\u201d or \u201cwhat is due to him\u201d (<i>S. Th. </i>II-II 58, 11).</p>\n<p>Shortly after Justinian became ruler of the Byzantine Empire in 527 C.E., he ordered the preparation of three compilations of Roman law: the <i>Codex</i>, which collected the legal pronouncements of the Roman emperors, the <i>Institutes</i>, a beginning student\u2019s handbook, and the <i>Digest</i>, which culled and organized everything of value from earlier Roman law. The <i>Digest </i>opened with Ulpian\u2019s definition of \u201cjustice.\u201d</p>\n<p>The <i>Digest </i>was the largest of the three texts, and proved to be by far the most influential. Its influence on the subsequent legal tradition of Christendom was enormous; it became its fundamental legal text. In offering Ulpian\u2019s explanation of what justice is, Aquinas was reflecting the influence of Justinian\u2019s <i>Digest.</i></p>\n<p>I know of no writers who explicitly contest Ulpian\u2019s account of justice in terms of rendering to one\u2019s fellows their right or due. Some of those who write about justice pay no attention to the connection between justice and rights. Some argue that there are no natural rights, only conferred rights \u2013 that is, rights conferred on us by some action, such as a promise performed by an individual, or a legislative act performed by an authority.<a class=\"anchor\" id=\"content100note1anc\" name=\"content100note1anc\">\u00a0</a><a class=\"note\" href=\"#content100note1sym\">[\u00a01\u00a0]</a> And some hold that thought and talk about rights is so seriously abused in the modern world that we should forego such thought and talk. But to the best of my knowledge, no one explicitly contests Ulpian\u2019s thought that justice \u2013 in contrast, say, to benevolence \u2013 consists of rendering to each their right, what they have a right to, what is due them, what would wrong them if they were denied it.</p>\n<p>A parenthetical note: it\u2019s unfortunate that English does not enable us to translate Ulpian\u2019s maxim with a pair of nouns like the Latin pair <i>justitia </i>and <i>jus</i>; we have to translate <i>jus </i>with terms that have no linguistic relation to the term \u201cjustice,\u201d such as \u201cright\u201d and \u201cdue.\u201d The closest we can come in English to the linguistic pairing available in Latin is this: \u201djustice is rendering to each what is justly theirs.\u201d</p>\n<h2>The biblical understanding of justice</h2>\n<p>In my Theology Brief, after an all-too-brief presentation of what the biblical writers say about justice, I wrote this:</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>The biblical writers do not explain what justice is; they assume we know what they are talking about when they speak of justice. They do not offer a \u201ctheory\u201d of justice. For an explanation of what justice is, a theory, we have to turn to philosophers.</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>The biblical writers do not explain what justice is; they assume we know what they are talking about when they speak of justice. They do not offer a \u201ctheory\u201d of justice. For an explanation of what justice is, a theory, we have to turn to philosophers.</p>\n<p>I then launched into my discussion of Aristotle and Ulpian.</p>\n<p>Some respondents found this transition problematic. When I said that the biblical writers do not offer a theory of justice, I had, in the back of my mind, an observation by the Old Testament scholar, Walter Brueggemann, that the dominant overarching character of \u201cIsrael\u2019s speech about God is that of testimony\u201d (<i>Theology of the Old Testament, </i>119). Testimony is obviously different from theory.</p>\n<p>None of the respondents argued, to the contrary, that the biblical writers do offer a theory of justice. But the passage gave some the impression of suggesting that, for the purpose of understanding justice, we can leave Scripture behind and turn to philosophers. They found this suggestion problematic \u2013 rightly so. One respondent wondered \u201cwhether there is not a distinctly biblical concept of justice.\u201d</p>\n<p>I don\u2019t think there is a distinct <i>concept </i>of justice in Scripture \u2013 not, at least, if one understands the term \u201cconcept\u201d as philosophers understand it, namely, as the sort of thing one would find in a dictionary\u2019s definition of the term. But there is a distinct <i>understanding </i>of justice in Scripture, a distinct <i>way of</i> <i>thinking about </i>justice. So let me now flesh out that understanding beyond the little I said in the brief, identifying what I see as salient features of the biblical understanding of justice. There are other understandings of justice that share some of the features of the biblical understanding; but when we put all the features of the biblical understanding together, the result is highly distinctive.</p>\n<h3><b>1. Fundamental to the biblical understanding of justice is the declaration that God is just and loves justice, and enjoins human beings to imitate God in doing and seeking justice.</b><a class=\"note\" href=\"#content100note2sym\">[\u00a02\u00a0]</a></h3>\n<p>\u201cI the Lord love justice,\u201d writes the prophet Isaiah (61:8). And in a well-known passage the prophet Micah writes:</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>The Lord has told you, O mortal, what is good,<br/>\n\u00a0\u00a0and what does the Lord require of you<br/>\nbut to do justice, and to love kindness,<br/>\n\u00a0\u00a0and to walk humbly with your God (6:8).</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>The Lord has told you, O mortal, what is good,<br/>\n\u00a0\u00a0and what does the Lord require of you<br/>\nbut to do justice, and to love kindness,<br/>\n\u00a0\u00a0and to walk humbly with your God (6:8).</p>\n<p>Plato\u2019s <i>Republic </i>is an extended dialogue on justice; Aristotle\u2019s <i>Nicomachean Ethics</i> includes an extended discourse on justice. In neither of these is there any mention of divinity; the accounts offered are purely secular. The biblical understanding of justice is an intrinsically theological understanding. God is up-front-center.</p>\n<h3>2. Equally fundamental to the biblical understanding of justice is that love for one\u2019s neighbor requires treating them justly and that one is to treat them justly out of love.</h3>\n<p>As Osam Temple notes in his response, \u201cthere can be justice without love. . . . You can do justice not out of conviction but out of fear of the law and punishment.\u201d On the biblical understanding of justice, doing justice is both required by love and to be an exercise of love.</p>\n<p>The English word \u201clove\u201d denotes a rather wide variety of different phenomena (see Chapter One of my <i>United in Love</i>). The love of neighbor that Jesus enjoins on us \u2013 <i>agap\u00ea </i>\u2013consists of seeking the good of the neighbor. Being treated justly is, obviously, a good in one\u2019s life. Though agapic love of neighbor often goes beyond doing what justice requires, it never falls short of doing what justice requires. It never perpetrates injustice.</p>\n<p>In my Theology Brief I noted that, in his influential 1930s publication <i>Agape and Eros</i>, the Swedish Lutheran bishop Anders Nygren argued that the love-command of Jesus supplants and supersedes the injunction of the Hebrew prophets to act justly. In chapters four and five of my <i>Justice: Rights and Wrongs, </i>I argued at some length against this supersessionist interpretation of the relation between the two testaments. The testaments are united in teaching that love incorporates acting justly and that we are to act justly out of love.</p>\n<p>It is not only theologians and biblical scholars who have pitted love and justice against each other. In the intellectual culture of the West there is a long tradition of doing so. The tradition continues. In her response to the theology brief, Eleonore Stump notes that \u201cIn the view of some [contemporary] feminist philosophers, . . . ethics based on justice needs to be supplemented or even supplanted by an \u2018ethics of care\u2019.\u201d I hold that caring about someone necessarily includes treating them justly, and doing what one can to see that others do so as well.</p>\n<h3><b>3. Another distinctive feature of how justice figures in the Hebrew Bible/Old Testament is that, over and over, the writers connect justice with what they call, in Hebrew, </b><i><b>shalom</b></i><i> </i>(for example, Isaiah 12: 16-17).</h3>\n<p>Shalom, often rendered as \u201cpeace\u201d in English translations, is better translated as \u201cwell-being\u201d or \u201cflourishing.\u201d Shalom consists of flourishing in all dimensions of one\u2019s existence: in one\u2019s relation to God, to one\u2019s fellow human beings, to the natural world, to human artifacts, to oneself. The thought of the writers was that insofar as one is a victim of injustice, one is not fully flourishing \u2013 even if, for some reason, one is content with one\u2019s condition. Though true and full shalom goes beyond what justice requires \u2013 a just community might suffer from famine caused by drought, and thus not experience shalom \u2013 justice is a condition of shalom. Justice is, as it were, the ground floor of shalom.</p>\n<h3><b>4. In the biblical understanding of justice, justice is an intrinsic component of what the New Testament writers call </b><i><b>the kingdom of God.</b></i></h3>\n<p>Luke writes that shortly after Jesus began speaking in public, he attended the synagogue in Nazareth on a Sabbath and was invited to read Scripture and comment on what he read. He was handed the scroll of the prophet Isaiah, unrolled it, and read the following:</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>The Spirit of the Lord is upon me,<br/>\n\u00a0\u00a0because he has anointed me to bring good news to the poor.<br/>\nHe has sent me to proclaim release to the captives<br/>\n\u00a0\u00a0and recovery of sight to the blind,<br/>\nto let the oppressed go free,<br/>\n\u00a0\u00a0to proclaim the year of the Lord.</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>The Spirit of the Lord is upon me,<br/>\n\u00a0\u00a0because he has anointed me to bring good news to the poor.<br/>\nHe has sent me to proclaim release to the captives<br/>\n\u00a0\u00a0and recovery of sight to the blind,<br/>\nto let the oppressed go free,<br/>\n\u00a0\u00a0to proclaim the year of the Lord.</p>\n<p>Luke reports that Jesus then rolled up the scroll, gave it back to the attendant, and sat down. \u201cThe eyes of all were fixed on him,\u201d writes Luke, expecting him to offer some commentary on what he had read. Jesus then said, \u201cToday this scripture has been fulfilled in your hearing.\u201d</p>\n<p>What Luke reported Jesus as reading was an adaptation of the opening verses of Isaiah 61, a passage that is a close parallel of a passage a few chapters earlier in which the prophet spoke explicitly of God\u2019s call for justice:</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>Is this not the fast that I choose,<br/>\n\u00a0\u00a0to loose the bonds of injustice,<br/>\n\u00a0\u00a0to undo the thongs of the yoke,<br/>\nto let the oppressed go free<br/>\n\u00a0\u00a0and to break every yoke? (58:6-7)</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>Is this not the fast that I choose,<br/>\n\u00a0\u00a0to loose the bonds of injustice,<br/>\n\u00a0\u00a0to undo the thongs of the yoke,<br/>\nto let the oppressed go free<br/>\n\u00a0\u00a0and to break every yoke? (58:6-7)</p>\n<p>The import of Jesus\u2019s declaration, \u201cToday this scripture has been fulfilled in your hearing,\u201d is unmistakable. Jesus identified himself as the one anointed by the Spirit of the Lord to proclaim the coming of justice in the year of the Lord\u2019s favor (the Year of Jubilee).</p>\n<p>In Matthew\u2019s gospel, Jesus has already been teaching and healing for some time when the gospel writer intrudes himself into the narrative to offer his interpretation of Jesus\u2019 identity \u2013 the same interpretation as that which Jesus himself offered in the synagogue. Jesus is \u201cto fulfill what had been spoken through the prophet Isaiah,\u201d namely,</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>I will put my Spirit upon him,<br/>\n\u00a0\u00a0and he will proclaim justice [<i>krisis</i>] to the Gentiles\u2026<br/>\nHe will not break a bruised reed<br/>\n\u00a0\u00a0Or quench a smoldering wick<br/>\nUntil he brings justice [<i>krisis</i>] to victory. (12:17-20)</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>I will put my Spirit upon him,<br/>\n\u00a0\u00a0and he will proclaim justice [<i>krisis</i>] to the Gentiles\u2026<br/>\nHe will not break a bruised reed<br/>\n\u00a0\u00a0Or quench a smoldering wick<br/>\nUntil he brings justice [<i>krisis</i>] to victory. (12:17-20)</p>\n<h3>5. When the biblical writers speak of justice and injustice, it is almost always social (systemic) justice and injustice that they have in mind</h3>\n<p>That is, justice and injustice in the laws and social practices of Israel. When condemning injustice, they seldom mention individual wrongdoers. The prophet Micah is typical:</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>The official and the judge ask for a bribe,<br/>\n\u00a0\u00a0and the powerful dictate what they desire;<br/>\nthus they pervert justice. (7:1)</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>The official and the judge ask for a bribe,<br/>\n\u00a0\u00a0and the powerful dictate what they desire;<br/>\nthus they pervert justice. (7:1)</p>\n<h3><b>6. No mention of names: A striking feature of what the biblical writers say about social justice and injustice in Israel is their emphasis on the condition of the widows, the orphans, the sojourners, and the impoverished \u2013 call them </b><i><b>the quartet of the vulnerable</b></i><b>.</b></h3>\n<p>So striking is this that one is compelled to ask \u201cWhy? What does it mean?\u201d</p>\n<p>A number of South American theologians, writing in the 60s and 70s of the last century, suggested that the emphasis on the quartet of the vulnerable has theological significance; it is, they said, an indication of what they called \u201cGod\u2019s preferential option for the poor.\u201d</p>\n<p>This suggestion did not sit well with a good many North American Christians: \u201cDoesn\u2019t God love everybody alike, rich as well as poor?\u201d The answer, surely, is yes; God loves all those who bear God\u2019s image, rich and poor alike. But why then is it the case, as it clearly is in the biblical testimony, that God has a preferential option for the poor \u2013 or more precisely, for the vulnerable?</p>\n<p>Nowhere in Plato\u2019s long dialogue about justice in the <i>Republic</i> does he make reference to the vulnerable in Athens. The reason he does not is that he is articulating principles of justice for an ideal society.<a class=\"anchor\" id=\"content100note3anc\" name=\"content100note3anc\">\u00a0</a><a class=\"note\" href=\"#content100note3sym\">[\u00a03\u00a0]</a> The biblical writers held out the hope for a messianic age; that is the form the ideal society took for them. But when they speak about justice, their eye is seldom on justice in the messianic age; almost always it is on justice and injustice in this present, far-from-ideal, age. They represent God as working to redeem humankind, and the cosmos in general, from fallenness, and as calling us to share in this cause.</p>\n<p>Those who seek the undoing of social injustice must set priorities. No doubt the wealthy and the powerful in Israel were sometimes victims of injustice, as they are in our present-day society \u2013 victims of <i>episodes </i>of injustice. The injustice experienced by the widows, the orphans, the sojourners, and the impoverished in ancient Israel was not <i>episodes </i>of injustice but <i>the daily condition </i>of injustice. It\u2019s because the biblical God is a redeeming God that there is, in God, a preferential option for the vulnerable \u2013 an option that we are to imitate.</p>\n<p>The vulnerable today include many more than the biblical quartet \u2013 prisoners, for example. In his response, Terry Halliday forcefully reminds us that they also include refugees and asylum seekers. I write these words two weeks after Russia invaded Ukraine. Today\u2019s edition of the <i>New York Times</i> reports that already more than 2 million Ukrainians have fled as refugees to neighboring countries.</p>\n<h3>7. In the biblical understanding of justice, securing justice in society is central to the God-given task of government.</h3>\n<p>The opening verses of Psalm 72 present a picture of the good king.</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>Give the king your justice, O God,<br/>\nand your doing right to the king\u2019s son.<br/>\nMay he judge your people rightly,<br/>\nand your poor with justice\u2026.<br/>\nMay he defend the cause of the poor of the people,<br/>\ngive deliverance to the needy and crush the oppressor.<a class=\"anchor\" id=\"content100note4anc\" name=\"content100note4anc\">\u00a0</a><a class=\"note\" href=\"#content100note4sym\">[\u00a04\u00a0]</a></p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>Give the king your justice, O God,<br/>\nand your doing right to the king\u2019s son.<br/>\nMay he judge your people rightly,<br/>\nand your poor with justice\u2026.<br/>\nMay he defend the cause of the poor of the people,<br/>\ngive deliverance to the needy and crush the oppressor.<a class=\"anchor\" id=\"content100note4anc\" name=\"content100note4anc\">\u00a0</a><a class=\"note\" href=\"#content100note4sym\">[\u00a04\u00a0]</a></p>\n<p>In the thirteenth chapter of his letter to the Romans, Paul repeats this understanding of the task of government, though less expansively: \u201cthe governing authority. . . is God\u2019s servant for your good. . . . It is the servant of God to execute wrath on the wrongdoer.\u201d</p>\n<p>In his book <i>Republican Theology: The Civil Religion of American Evangelicals, </i>Benjamin T. Lynerd shows, with impressive documentation, that over the past century the dominant view among American evangelicals concerning the task of government was that its main task is to secure individual liberty. In the writings that he quotes, there is rarely any mention of justice. This is a sharp departure from the biblical understanding. Securing justice does often require securing individual liberty; but they are not the same. Liberty without justice is freedom for the lions and eagles of the world to seek their prey.</p>\n<h3>8. In the biblical understanding of justice, to worship God is to render to God what is due God \u2013 to render to God what justice requires.</h3>\n<p>The psalmist says:</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>Ascribe to the Lord, O families of peoples,<br/>\n\u00a0\u00a0ascribe to the Lord glory and honor.<br/>\nAscribe to the Lord the glory due his name. (96:7-8)</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>Ascribe to the Lord, O families of peoples,<br/>\n\u00a0\u00a0ascribe to the Lord glory and honor.<br/>\nAscribe to the Lord the glory due his name. (96:7-8)</p>\n<p>And in another passage:</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>Praise is due to you, O God in Zion,<br/>\n\u00a0\u00a0and to you shall vows be performed. (65:1)</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>Praise is due to you, O God in Zion,<br/>\n\u00a0\u00a0and to you shall vows be performed. (65:1)</p>\n<p>This theme is echoed in many Christian liturgies. To cite just one example: in The Holy Eucharist: Rite One of the Episcopal Church, the Great Thanksgiving begins with the following words, spoken by the celebrant:</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>It is very meet, right, and our bounden duty, that we should at all times, and in all places, give thanks unto Thee, O Lord, holy Father, almighty everlasting God.<a class=\"anchor\" id=\"content100note5anc\" name=\"content100note5anc\">\u00a0</a><a class=\"note\" href=\"#content100note5sym\">[\u00a05\u00a0]</a></p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>It is very meet, right, and our bounden duty, that we should at all times, and in all places, give thanks unto Thee, O Lord, holy Father, almighty everlasting God.<a class=\"anchor\" id=\"content100note5anc\" name=\"content100note5anc\">\u00a0</a><a class=\"note\" href=\"#content100note5sym\">[\u00a05\u00a0]</a></p>\n<p>As I mentioned at the beginning of this section, some of the features salient in the biblical understanding of justice can also be found in other understandings of justice. But nowhere else is there anything like the complete biblical understanding. It is unique.</p>\n<h2>Justice in context</h2>\n<p>Several scholars expressed uneasiness with the Theology Brief\u2019s almost exclusive focus on justice; they heard in it a <i>justice-is-everything</i> tone. They argued that justice is but one component in a good and moral life, an indispensable component, indeed, but not the whole, and that it is important to locate it within that larger context. (See especially the responses by Nicholas Aroney and Patrick Parkinson.)</p>\n<p>These respondents are correct in noting that, apart from a short discussion of the relation between justice and love, the brief did not place justice within the context of the good and moral life generally; they are also correct in claiming that not doing so runs the danger of encouraging a myopic concern with justice. So let me now make some remarks on the relation of justice to other components of the good and moral life.</p>\n<p>Ulpian\u2019s formula, from which I took my lead, was a definition of the virtue <i>justitia: justitia </i>is a steady and enduring will to render to each their<i> jus. </i>In my brief I focused my attention not on that virtue but on the action which the virtue actualizes. I asked, what constitutes <i>rendering to each their</i> <i>jus</i>? What constitutes <i>acting justly</i>? The action has explanatory priority over the virtue: to explain what the virtue is, one has to know what the action is.</p>\n<p>The virtue is obviously important, however. If there were not, in the members of society, the virtue of a \u201csteady and enduring will\u201d to treat each other justly, just action would be, at best, a haphazard and fortuitous thing.</p>\n<p>The English term \u201cjustice,\u201d unlike the Latin <i>jusititia,</i> does not name a virtue. It\u2019s the term \u201cbeing just\u201d that names the virtue. For justice to prevail in society, the virtue of <i>being just </i>must prevail.</p>\n<p>The virtue of being just cannot be exercised all by itself, however; it requires the exercise of a range of other virtues. It requires, above all, a certain kind of humility, a humility which takes the form of decentering, of being attentive to the dignity, the praiseworthiness, of the other person. Typically such decentering requires a willingness to listen to the other person, to listen to their story. Being just also requires the virtues of empathy and anger: empathy with victims of injustice, anger at the perpetrators. And very often it requires the virtue of having overcome prejudices of various sorts: prejudice against members of another race, against members of another religion, against members of another political party, against speakers of another language, against persons who are obese, on and on.</p>\n<p>Not only does exercising the virtue of being just require the exercise of many other virtues. Sometimes just action <i>consists of </i>exercising some other virtue. For example, sometimes treating the other person justly<i> </i>requires telling them the truth; the person who is not in the habit of truth-telling will often act unjustly. Sometimes treating the other person justly does not just <i>require </i>listening to them but <i>consists of </i>listening to them.</p>\n<p>And sometimes the exercise of some other virtue, or the pursuit of some other value, requires exercising the virtue of being just. Friendship is a good example of the point. Though friendship, obviously, does not consist of treating each other justly it certainly doing so.</p>\n<p>The example of friendship suggests a general point. Not only is it important to note the intricate intertwinement of being just and acting justly with other virtues and values. Acting justly and being treated justly are but two of the innumerable multiplicity of things that are of value in our human existence: a home of one\u2019s own, surroundings in which one can take aesthetic delight, awe before the unfathomable intricacy and immensity of God\u2019s creation, gratitude. The list has no end.</p>\n<h2>Uneasiness with thought and talk about rights</h2>\n<p>Some of the respondents expressed uneasiness with the prominence of rights in my discussion. In my brief I observed that uneasiness with, and hostility toward, rights-talk are widespread, and I addressed what I saw as the root of this uneasiness or hostility. This is part of what I wrote:</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>This hostility has many roots, the most common being, so it appears to me, the conviction that rights-talk is made to order for expressing one of the most pervasive and malignant diseases of modern society, namely, the mentality of possessive individualism. It\u2019s made to order, so it is said, for an \u201centitlement society,\u201d such as ours in which individuals place themselves at the center of the moral universe, focusing on their own entitlements to the neglect of the cultivation of those virtues that are indispensable for the flourishing of our lives together. . . . The theologian Joan Lockwood O\u2019Donovan puts the point crisply: \u201cthe modern liberal concept of rights belongs to the socially atomistic and disintegrative philosophy of possessive individualism.\u201d</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>This hostility has many roots, the most common being, so it appears to me, the conviction that rights-talk is made to order for expressing one of the most pervasive and malignant diseases of modern society, namely, the mentality of possessive individualism. It\u2019s made to order, so it is said, for an \u201centitlement society,\u201d such as ours in which individuals place themselves at the center of the moral universe, focusing on their own entitlements to the neglect of the cultivation of those virtues that are indispensable for the flourishing of our lives together. . . . The theologian Joan Lockwood O\u2019Donovan puts the point crisply: \u201cthe modern liberal concept of rights belongs to the socially atomistic and disintegrative philosophy of possessive individualism.\u201d</p>\n<p>I went on to argue that the preoccupation of the possessive individualist with claiming his own rights is an abuse of rights-talk. When I am in the presence of another, not only do I have rights <i>vis-\u00e0-vis </i>the other person; she has rights <i>vis-a-vis </i>me. All components of our moral vocabulary are subject to abuse. When confronted with such abuse, one does not argue for eliminating that component of our moral vocabulary; one does what one can to combat the abuse.</p>\n<p>I now think that this response, though not mistaken, is not entirely adequate. It appears to me that not all of those who feel uneasy with, or hostile to, rights-talk, have their eye on the malign influence of the \u201cphilosophy of possessive individualism.\u201d They do not all have their eye on the abuse of rights-talk by possessive individualists. Rather, so it appears to me, a good many of them, when thinking of rights, think primarily of <i>claiming rights</i>; and they are convinced that claiming rights \u2013 whether the claim is made by oneself or another person \u2013 is incompatible with, and intrinsically inferior morally to, the \u201cbeing-for-the-other\u201d (Karl Barth\u2019s words) which Jesus enjoined in his second love-command \u2013 and also incompatible with, and morally inferior to, attending to one\u2019s responsibilities toward the other.</p>\n<p>Part of my response to this analysis is similar to my response to the previous analysis: just as it is a mistake to focus just on the abuse of rights-talk by possessive individualists, so also it is a mistake, when thinking of rights, to think primarily of <i>claiming</i> rights. Rights are not only to be <i>claimed, </i>they are also to be <i>acknowledged</i>. Rights-talk is not only for claiming rights but also for acknowledging rights.</p>\n<p>Let me take the argument a step further. Jesus\u2019 second love-command was not \u201cLove your neighbor.\u201d It was \u201cLove your neighbor as yourself\u201d (quoting Leviticus 19:18). It was, to adapt Barth, \u201cBe for the other as you are for yourself.\u201d The command implies the moral propriety of well-ordered self-regard \u2013 the moral propriety of well-ordered self-love. Speaking up for one\u2019s own rights, claiming them, out of well-ordered self-regard, is not intrinsically inferior morally to acknowledging the rights of others.</p>\n<p>It\u2019s true that to forego claiming certain of one\u2019s rights, to forego speaking up for them, is sometimes the right thing to do. But the person who thinks she has no right to claim her own rights \u2013 worse yet, the person who thinks she has no rights \u2013 is morally defective in a deep and profound way, perhaps through no fault of her own. She fails to recognize that she too has dignity, that she too has worth that calls to be honored. In my brief I remarked that all the great social justice movements of the twentieth century employed the language of rights. In doing so, the members of those movements were giving voice to their recognition that they too had dignity.</p>\n<p>Of course, it remains the case that not all rights-claims are true; a good many are false. But the same is the case for duty-claims; many of those too are false. The husband who tells his abused wife that she has a duty to submit is speaking falsehood.</p>\n<h2>Amplifying what was said concerning the nature of rights and their relation to duties</h2>\n<p>Responding to some questions raised about rights requires that I expand on what I said in the brief about the nature of rights and the relation of rights to duties.</p>\n<p>A number of scholars noted that rights sometimes conflict, and asked what we are to make of that. Some writers on these matters have suggested that this is a reason for rejecting the very idea of rights; the idea, they say, is incoherent.</p>\n<p>Obligations conflict in the same way that rights conflict. In Plato\u2019s <i>Republic</i>, Socrates offers the example of someone who has promised to return in due time a weapon that he borrowed from a friend. The friend, in the meantime, has gone mad and is likely to use the weapon to harm himself or others. The borrower has an obligation to keep his promise; but he also has an obligation not to put a dangerous weapon in the hands of someone who is likely to use it to harm someone. Conflicting obligations.</p>\n<p>The standard way in which philosophers deal with such conflicts is by distinguishing between <i>prima facie </i>duties and all-things-considered duties \u2013 the latter typically called <i>ultima facie </i>or <i>pro tanto</i> duties. Prima facie duties do, indeed, often conflict. But it is the view of most philosophers that all-things-considered duties do not conflict. If one considers just the promise the person made to return the weapon to his friend, he ought to do that; that is his prima facie duty. If one considers just putting a dangerous weapon in the hands of someone who has lost his sanity, he ought not to do that; that is his prima facie duty. Two conflicting prima facie duties or obligations. But if one asks what he ought to do <i>all things considered</i>, it seems clear that all-things-considered he ought to prevent his friend from harming himself or others by not keeping his promise to return the weapon. That is his ultima facie obligation. No conflict.</p>\n<p>Along the same lines, we should distinguish <i>prima facie </i>rights from <i>ultima facie </i>(<i>pro tanto</i>) rights. If we consider just the promise made, the friend has a prima face right to the borrower keeping his promise by returning the weapon. If we consider just putting a dangerous weapon in the hands of someone who has gone insane, the friend has a prima facie right to the borrower not putting a dangerous weapon in his hands. Two conflicting prima facie rights. But all things considered, surely the friend has a right to the borrower breaking his promise and not putting a dangerous weapon in his hands. That is his ultima facie right. No conflict.</p>\n<p>From these observations about the nature of rights let\u2019s move on to some points about the relation of rights to duties. In my brief, I affirmed a principle of correlation between rights and duties (obligations). Here is how I stated the principle: if you have a right to my treating you a certain way, then I have an obligation to treat you that way, and conversely.</p>\n<p>This way of stating the principle fails to take account of third-party duties and rights. Rather than its being my duty to treat you a certain way, it may be my duty to you to treat Malchus a certain way. Correspondingly, rather than your having a right to my treating you a certain way, you may have a right to my treating Malchus a certain way. Taking account of third-party duties and rights, the way to state the principle of correlatives is this: If I have a duty to you to treat X a certain way, then you have a right to my treating X that way, and conversely.</p>\n<p>An objection one sometimes hears to the existence of so-called <i>benefit rights </i>is that often it is impossible to specify a party responsible for honoring the right. Suppose, for example, that in a well-to-do modern society everybody has a right to adequate health care. If so, who is responsible for honoring that right? The question appears to have no answer. The principle of correlatives appears not to hold. Permission rights are different. If I have a right to assemble with others for religious worship, then <i>everybody</i> has a duty to permit me to assemble.</p>\n<p>Here, too, thinking about duties helps us to get clear about rights. Immanuel Kant introduced the idea of what he called <i>imperfect </i>duties. An imperfect duty is a duty to treat <i>someone or other</i> a certain way without there being anyone such that it is one\u2019s duty to treat <i>them</i> that way. Many duties of charity are like that. I may have a duty to extend a certain kind of charity to <i>someone or</i> <i>other</i> without there being anyone such that it is my duty to extend that charity to <i>them.</i> I am free to choose.</p>\n<p>I suggest that we think of rights along the same lines. Just as there are imperfect duties, so too there are imperfect rights: the right to be treated a certain way by <i>someone or other </i>without there being anyone such that one has the right to be treated that way by <i>them</i>. Again, charity offers familiar examples. The beggar has a right to someone or other alleviating his need; if no one did, he would be wronged. But there may be no one such that he has the right to <i>that </i>person alleviating his need. The right to adequate health care is like that \u2013 a genuine right, albeit an imperfect right.</p>\n<p>Return to the principle of correlatives between duties and rights. With that principle in mind, a natural question to ask concerning my analysis of justice \u2013 and a question some respondents did ask \u2013 is this: if duties and rights really are correlated in the way indicated, why not work out an account of justice in terms of duties rather than in terms of rights?</p>\n<p>Let\u2019s make sure that we understand the proposal. In my Theology Brief, I devoted considerable space to considering why the recognition of rights is important \u2013 what would be lost if we never thought or talked in terms of rights. I argued that a number of things of great importance would be lost. The proposal we are now considering is not that we eliminate thinking and speaking about rights. The proposal is rather that we understand justice in terms of duties rather than in terms of rights.</p>\n<p>It\u2019s a question I have never previously considered, and I don\u2019t feel entirely satisfied with my answer. I think it is the influence on me, and on most other writers in the West, of Ulpian\u2019s formula, transmitted to us by way of Justinian\u2019s <i>Digest. </i>Ulpian did not explain <i>justitia </i>as the steady and enduring will to treat others as <i>one</i> <i>ought </i>to treat them. He explained <i>justitia </i>as the steady and enduring will to treat others as <i>they </i>have <i>a right </i>to be treated. <i>Justitia </i>is explained not in terms of <i>an agent\u2019s obligations </i>but in terms of <i>a recipient\u2019s rights. </i>The Latin pair, <i>justitia </i> and <i>jus, </i>made this formula compelling.</p>\n<p>We have all followed in Ulpian\u2019s footsteps, connecting justice to rights rather than to obligations, doing so in spite of the principle of correlatives. I don\u2019t know what a theory of justice developed in terms of duties rather than rights would look like. Perhaps not much different. Possibly quite different.</p>\n<h2>A recent publication on the history of the idea of natural rights</h2>\n<p>An important, recently published, book directly relevant to our discussion is <i>The Blessings of Liberty: Human Rights and Religious Freedom in the Western Legal Tradition, </i>by the legal historian John Witte.<a class=\"anchor\" id=\"content100note6anc\" name=\"content100note6anc\">\u00a0</a><a class=\"note\" href=\"#content100note6sym\">[\u00a06\u00a0]</a> In my brief I wrote that it is commonly said, by secular and Christian writers alike, that \u201cthe idea of natural rights was devised by the secular individualist philosophers of the Enlightenment, and that it continues to carry the DNA of its origins.\u201d Secular writers who tell this story about origins typically praise the idea on account of its origins; Christian writers who tell the story invariably condemn the idea for the same reason. I went on to note that \u201cthe medieval intellectual historian, Brian Tierney, showed decisively in his 1997 publication, <i>The Idea of Natural Rights,</i> that this historical clam is mistaken. He shows that the canon lawyers of the 12<sup>th</sup> century were explicitly employing the idea of natural rights.\u201d</p>\n<p>I predict that <i>The Blessings of Liberty</i> will prove to be the decisive treatment of the matter. Based on a lifetime of scholarship, Witte goes far beyond Tierney\u2019s focus on the medieval period to tell the story of human rights and religious freedom from their earliest appearance in the Western legal tradition up to the present.<a class=\"anchor\" id=\"content100note7anc\" name=\"content100note7anc\">\u00a0</a><a class=\"note\" href=\"#content100note7sym\">[\u00a07\u00a0]</a> Summarizing his treatment of the early modern period, Witte writes, \u201cearly modern Protestant theologians and jurists on both sides of the Atlantic expounded complex theories of natural law and natural rights\u201d (76). And summarizing his opening discussion of Roman and medieval jurisprudence he writes, \u201cFor Western jurists and judges, rights-talk was a common way to define and defend the law\u2019s protection, support, limitations, and entitlements of persons and groups in society as well as the proper relationships between political and other authorities and their respective subjects. For Western lawyers, subjective rights were not a modern invention. . . . Lawyers since classical Roman and medieval times used rights ideas and terms. . . \u201d (72). <i>The Blessings of Liberty </i>should put to rest once and for all the claim that the idea of natural rights was an invention of the secular philosophers of the Enlightenment.</p>\n<h2>In Conclusion</h2>\n<p>In my 2019 publication, <i>Religion in the University</i>,<a class=\"anchor\" id=\"content100note8anc\" name=\"content100note8anc\">\u00a0</a><a class=\"note\" href=\"#content100note8sym\">[\u00a08\u00a0]</a> I defend the thesis, against a number of objections, that religious voices have a place in the modern university. The argument remains purely abstract, of course, if it turns out that religious people have nothing significant to say on matters relevant to the academy, or if they remain silent because they feel insecure or intimidated. The project of the Global Faculty Initiative is to encourage and enhance the Christian voice on topics that are, or should be, of concern to the academy. Among those topics is justice, both within the academy and outside.</p>\n<p>The Theology Brief on justice that I wrote for the GFI evoked responses that were, as I wrote in the opening sentence of this essay, \u201cperceptive, inspiring, gratifying \u2013 and in some cases surprising.\u201d I have learned from them about the many ways in which Christian scholars are already thinking and speaking about justice, and seeking to act justly. Responding to their probing questions has been a gratifying experience.</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<h2 class=\"new_page\">End Notes</h2>\n<p class=\"endnote\"><a class=\"note\" href=\"#content100note1anc\">[\u00a01\u00a0]</a><a class=\"anchor\" id=\"content100note1sym\" name=\"content100note1sym\">\u00a0</a> Those who argue that there are no natural rights typically do not think of them as non-conferred rights \u2013 which I judge is how we ought to think of them.

    "bodyText": "I have often pondered on the issues that Nicholas Wolterstorff has lucidly raised during almost fifty years of working to reduce disaster risks. The key passage in Micah chapter 6 has always presented a powerful challenge for anyone working in the disaster field- how to balance the need for \u2018doing justice\u2019 and providing \u2018loving kindness (or mercy)\u2019 \u2013 not one or the other, but both . The need is to seek for both justice and mercy, often within the same project or work programme, while maintaining a humble relationship with a loving God.\n\nMy work in disaster planning began through my association with Tearfund, an evangelical relief and development agency that has now the fifth largest humanitarian organisation in Britain. Initially, issues seemed clear cut, the aim was to provide relief, to offer mercy to the suffering. The parable of the Good Samaritan was often cited by Christian relief agencies as they went about their aid distribution. In those early 1970\u2019s there was much hesitation in the board rooms of evangelical agencies concerning the risks in becoming involved in matters of justice. Such matters were generally regarded as the province and preoccupation of the World Council of Churches, liberal theologians and the political left. Now, half a century later, a far better balance has been achieved with justice and mercy issues becoming well integrated in holistic Christian Ministry.\n\nI can vividly recall an electric moment in a Tear Fund conference in 1974 when the justice issue surfaced. Various speakers described their rather paternalistic intentions to provide British technical assistance to improve farming practice in certain drought-prone African Countries. Their comments were met by an irate response from Dr Darling, Head of Wye Agricultural College, who had spent most of his career in Central Africa.\n\n\u201cScripture in James 1-5 cries out, not for charity but for justice for agricultural producers. Any system we encourage must end - up with the farmer getting a fair price for what he gives. Senior Nigerian and Sudanese people have said to me - \u2018Give us a fair price for our primary products and take your technical assistance and do what you like with it. We don\u2019t want to be obliged to you. You pay us what we\u2019ve earned and we\u2019ll hire the people we want to come and give us the assistance we need.\u2019\n\nWe must aim for that - justice not charity is the prime object- but God forbid that we should withhold charity when it is needed and we have the power to give.\u201d [\u00a01\u00a0]\n\nMy understanding of the aid industry expanded and deepened when undertaking PhD research on Shelter following Disaster in the Development Planning Unit (DPU) set within University College, London (UCL) . This led directly into the subject of development planning and disaster risk reduction involving a host of demanding justice issues. I will attempt to summarise some of these concerns within this paper.\n\nThe sentiments noted above by Dr Darling concerning the need to avoid paternalism remain highly applicable to the disaster risk and recovery field where my PhD supervisor, a leading figure in Development Practice, Professor Otto Koenigsberger, Head of DPU, once perceptively wrote a powerful challenge to the relief community:\n\n\u2018 Relief is the enemy of recovery, so minimise relief to maximise recovery. Avoid paternalism at all costs. Assisting groups must never do what survivors can do or provide for themselves .\u2019 [\u00a02\u00a0]\n\nThe aims and practice of disaster protection and recovery need to expand beyond the delivery of relief provision \u2013 well beyond the bare statistics of numbers of safe houses rebuilt, jobs created and infrastructure protected. Wolterstorff reminds us that justice is the \u2018ground floor of shalom\u2019 and shalom consists of \u2018flourishing\u2019. This issue was beautifully captured in that famous speech by Martin Luther-King called : \u2018 I\u2019ve Been to the Mountain Top \u2019, delivered on April 3, 1968, the day before he was tragically assassinated:\n\n\u201c\u2026 . I think the Good Samaritan is a great individual. I of course, like and respect the Good Samaritan\u2026.but I don\u2019t want to be a Good Samaritan.\u201d Dr. King continued, \u201c\u2026you see, I am tired of picking up people along the Jericho Road. I am tired of seeing people battered and bruised and bloody, injured and jumped on, along the Jericho Roads of life. This road is dangerous. I don\u2019t want to pick up anyone else, along this Jericho Road; I want to fix\u2026 the Jericho Road. I want to pave the Jericho Road, add street lights to the Jericho Road; make the Jericho Road safe (for passage) by everybody\u2026.\u201d [\u00a03\u00a0]\n\nSo, for almost half a century, the major challenge in my career has been to work with others to create the safer world that King longed to see emerge. The aim has been to achieve higher levels of security from the threats posed to lives, livelihoods, the natural environment and property by the devastating forces of earthquakes, volcanic activity, floods, droughts, high winds, climate change etc. I have worked in various roles: architect, consultant to UN Agencies, Governments and voluntary and private sectors and as an academic based in various universities. In the early 1970\u2019s the concerned community of individuals, agencies and academic bodies interested in disaster risk was comparatively small and isolated, but with the exponential increase in disaster threats the global risk reduction community has become extensive and more integrated, with a rapidly expanding political awareness.\n\nReducing complex risks requires inter-disciplinary activity with concerted physical, environmental, social, economic and political actions. These processes, all aimed towards the creation of safe conditions, have been variously described as \u2018disaster mitigation\u2019, \u2018disaster preparedness\u2019, \u2018disaster risk reduction\u2019, \u2018disaster risk management\u2019, \u2018protective planning\u2019, \u2018adaptation to climate change\u2019 or \u2018the creation of resilient structures, institutions, societies and individuals\u2019.\n\nIn this paper I seek to comment on disasters as the product, or consequence, of the relationship between hazards and vulnerability and to highlight some of the justice issues described by Wolterstorff that relate to this collision and the quest for safety. A caveat is needed since this short paper inevitably risks over-simplifying the complexity of the subject that has extensive literature across its many disciplines: engineering/ health/ development planning/ public policy etc. and references have been kept to a minimum.\n\nUnresolved issues of justice and rights pervade the subject at all levels and in all sectors. Typical ethical questions that have attracted the attention of international conference delegates, academics and political leaders include: why are certain groups of people exposed to disaster risks?; what are the links between offering mercy and working for justice?; how are disaster risks generated, maintained and expanded?; who secures protection from disaster risks and why? and do communities have intrinsic rights to safety and who confers such rights?\n\nThe collective focus of concern has centred on ways to counter an oppressive vulnerability and exposure and in many cases an acute lack of justice for vast millions of people suffering from unjust \u2013 often criminal policies and practices. Professor David Alexander (4) has recognised the pervasive corruption that lies at a high percentage of disaster deaths, injuries, and property damage:\n\n\u201c Corruption is an insidious problem that affects all societies, rich or poor. It defies easy characterization and direct measurement, yet it can have very clear, concrete effects. These are mainly of four kinds:\n\n(a.) failure to observe rules, laws, regulations, and standards that relate to safety and protection of the public;\n\n(b.) exploitation and lack of protection of vulnerable members of the public;\n\n(c.) propagation of vulnerability to hazards through failure to take appropriate risk reduction measures, or weakening of existing measures;\n\nand\n\n(d.) undermining representation of the people, human rights, and community cohesion.\n\nFrom this it can be seen that there are sins of both omission and commission. Failure to protect the public is one of the former, while exploitation of people and undermining of standards are examples of the latter\u201d [\u00a04\u00a0]\n\nSuch failures relate to Wolstersorft\u2019s challenge to us to ponder how Christ\u2019s proclamation of bringing \u2018good news to the oppressed\u2026and liberty to the captives\u2019 relates to our varied disciplines. in my case this applies to architecture, engineering, urban design, planning, land ownership, and official land and housing policies. The justice issues noted in this paper are all in the \u2018 second-order justice\u2019 category that has been proposed.\n\nUp to about 1960 the term \u2018 Natural Disasters\u2019 was widely used, but as the geographical, engineering and social science professions focused their attention of the causal factors that gave rise to disasters, a recognition grew that unnatural disaster risk required the separation of two key elements. First, the existence of a Hazard: a climatic, biological, hydrological or geo-physical event outside of human control and second - Vulnerability or Exposure to such events or processes, controlled by human societies. In a key paper of 1976, Phil O\u2019Keefe, Ken Westgate and Ben Wisner of the Disaster Research Centre in Bradford University argued the case that disasters are more a consequence of socio-economic than natural factors. [\u00a05\u00a0] The negative impact of Hazard multiplied by Vulnerability can be reduced by increased Capacity that can include a diverse set of positive educational, physical and spiritual assets.\n\nTheir insights could be expressed as a simple formula:\n\nHazard (H) x Vulnerability (V) Disaster Risk (R) = ------------------------------------------ Capacity (C)\n\nI then devised a rather basic \u2018Crunch Diagram\u2019 in 1978 based on these relationships that was included in my first book: \u2018 Shelter after Disaster\u2019. [\u00a06\u00a0]\n\nFig.1. Initial Crunch Diagram, 1978\n\nThis rudimentary model was gradually developed as a central theme in the analysis of Disaster Vulnerability: \u2018 At Risk, natural hazards, people\u2019s vulnerability and disasters\u2019 written by four authors: Piers Blaikie, Terry Cannon, Ian Davis and Ben Wisner in 1994 and further expanded in a second edition in 2004. [\u00a07\u00a0] Within past decades the model has been gradually accepted by the international community and in academic courses in schools and universities. I then made further revisions to the model in 2020 following growing evidence of the impact of Climate Change. [\u00a08\u00a0]\n\nFig.2. Further Expansion to the Crunch Diagram, 2020\n\nThe justice and rights issues that emerged in the subsequent development of the crunch diagram are highlighted above in Fig 2.\n\nThe \u2018underlying causes\u2019, (sometimes called \u2018risk-drivers\u2019) are all deeply rooted aspects of un-development or social/ economic deprivation. They include poverty, racism, discrimination etc. The progression of vulnerability described in the diagram indicates how such forces can drive pressures that can ultimately lead to highly unsafe conditions. Research is needed to determine the nature, route and consequence of such connections in specific contexts.\n\nThe essence of the diagram is that the standard political approach to risk reduction is to focus on addressing unsafe conditions, such as producing manuals for local builders on how to build safely. However, such worthy actions can be limited in their effectiveness, merely providing cosmetic attention to \u2018symptoms\u2019, leaving \u2018underlying causes\u2019 undisturbed. The entrenched reasons why buildings are unsafe and set on unsafe sites are thus sidestepped.\n\nDeeply rooted historical patterns of exploitation have been referred to in subsequent versions of the crunch model described as \u2018structural violence\u2019, \u2018historical patterns of underdevelopment\u2019, \u2018neo colonialism\u2019 and \u2018neo-liberalism\u2019.\n\nCommunities who live or work in highly unsafe sites are vulnerable to multiple hazards. For example, inhabiting steep slopes subject to rockfalls and landslides that can occur in high rainfall, earthquake impact, shorelines subject to river or coastal flooding or tsunami attack. Such sites may be occupied by communities living illegally on prohibited sites, or in some situations the authorities may have actually provided the land for housing development on sites they know to be highly dangerous.\n\nDangerous construction practice is a common feature exposed in disaster damage assessments. Examples abound and include reinforced concrete with the corrupt omission of vital steel reinforcement, the substitution of sea-sand (costing nothing) containing corrosive salt in the concrete mix in lieu of prescribed pure sand (that has to be purchased). Dangerous construction can also result from ignorance concerning good, safe construction practice.\n\nGovernment building safety construction by- laws or land-use planning controls are often sidestepped by the taking of bribes by enforcement officials. The situation is often \u2018regularised\u2019 by Governments paying such officials low-wages based on the assumption they will top them up by the receipt of bribes\n\nIn 1976 Guatemala experienced a devastating earthquake with over 23,000 deaths mainly resulting from unsafe construction of dwellings set on unsafe sites. A leading engineering seismologist - Professor N. Ambraseys from Imperial College reviewed the situation at a Royal Society Symposium where he predicted that: \u2018 Today\u2019s Act of God will be regarded as Tomorrow\u2019s Act of Criminal Negligence\u2019 . Thirty-five years later in 2011 Ambraseys, writing with a leading US earthquake expert Professor Roger Bilham provided the evidence of the correlation between corruption and earthquake deaths as they analysed earthquake deaths against levels of national corruption as identified by the German based NGO \u2018 Transparancy International\u2019. Their shocking conclusion in their paper: \u2018 Corruption Kills\u2019 [\u00a09\u00a0] was that 83% of all earthquake deaths over a thirty year period were the result of corruption that could be found in the design, construction and siting of unsafe dwellings. A lethal combination of action and inaction that weakened the promulgation, application, and enforcement of safety standards.\n\nGovernments often possess detailed assessments of potential risks facing their citizens, but for political control reasons fail to share this data with affected communities. This data may relate to risks associated with unsafe buildings, such as the structural safety of schools, or the occupation of unsafe sites as noted above. In other situations, unscrupulous land-owners have sold land knowing the risks while withholding the risk assessment data to house purchasers or house renters. (The blood pressure of the prophet Amos would have risen to boiling point over such evil practices!)\n\nA common problem in the management of river flooding is for an upstream community to build safety measures for their communities that can increase downstream flooding \u2013 thus transferring and intensifying the risks facing others. In complex river catchments that cross national boundaries this practice can result in hostilities or \u2018river-wars\u2019.\n\nCurrently, in June 2021, there is a dispute on this precise issue amongst communities living beside the River Thames. A flood protection measure for the (upstream) towns of Windsor and Maidenhead costing \u00a3110 million generated enhanced flooding for Wraysbury (downstream) but the towns of Windsor and Maidenhead have refused to contribute \u00a341 million to the cost of protection of the downstream communities. [\u00a010\u00a0]\n\nGovernmental action is often found wanting, and this \u2018sin of omission\u2019 is certainly an issue of justice. Professor Ian Burton has noted that:\n\n\u201c\u2026 decision makers often find themselves faced with pressures not to act or to delay decisions perhaps indefinitely. There is often a power structure and a set of political interests to which decision makers respond or comply with and fail to act in the best interests of the community as a whole in terms of risk and damage reduction. This power structure and political interests can be local, national and international (global) and there can also be expressions of private sector interests.\u201d [\u00a011\u00a0]\n\nI conclude with the reminder that the root causes described in the Disaster Crunch Model include fundamental justice issues of poverty and inequality. These underlying causal factors relate to corrupt practice and the denial of access of marginal, disadvantaged communities, or sections of communities such as women, to representation, resources, power and knowledge. Each of these risk drivers presents a formidable challenge for any concerned individual, local church, concerned agency or government. But we need to remind ourselves that we serve a living God who cares for any vulnerable exploited community and takes positive delight in our faith and obedience to \u2018move mountains\u2019.\n\n\" If you have faith as small as a mustard seed, you can say to this mountain , \u2019 Move from here to there,\u2019 and it will move . Nothing will be impossible for you.\u201d Matthew 17:20\n\nAll India Disaster Mitigation Institute (AIDMI) The Contribution of Dr Ian Davis to Disaster Risk and Recovery Management 1972-2020 Southasiadisasters.net Issue 189, 2020.

    "bodyHtml": "<p>I have often pondered on the issues that Nicholas Wolterstorff has lucidly raised during almost fifty years of working to reduce disaster risks. The key passage in Micah chapter 6 has always presented a powerful challenge for anyone working in the disaster field- how to balance the need for \u2018doing justice\u2019 and providing \u2018loving kindness (or mercy)\u2019 \u2013 not one or the other, but <i>both</i>. The need is to seek for both justice and mercy, often within the same project or work programme, while maintaining a humble relationship with a loving God.</p>\n<p>My work in disaster planning began through my association with Tearfund, an evangelical relief and development agency that has now the fifth largest humanitarian organisation in Britain. Initially, issues seemed clear cut, the aim was to provide relief, to offer mercy to the suffering. The parable of the Good Samaritan was often cited by Christian relief agencies as they went about their aid distribution. In those early 1970\u2019s there was much hesitation in the board rooms of evangelical agencies concerning the risks in becoming involved in matters of justice. Such matters were generally regarded as the province and preoccupation of the World Council of Churches, liberal theologians and the political left. Now, half a century later, a far better balance has been achieved with justice and mercy issues becoming well integrated in holistic Christian Ministry.</p>\n<p>I can vividly recall an electric moment in a Tear Fund conference in 1974 when the justice issue surfaced. Various speakers described their rather paternalistic intentions to provide British technical assistance to improve farming practice in certain drought-prone African Countries. Their comments were met by an irate response from Dr Darling, Head of Wye Agricultural College, who had spent most of his career in Central Africa.</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>\u201cScripture in James 1-5 cries out, not for charity but for justice for agricultural producers. Any system we encourage must end - up with the farmer getting a fair price for what he gives. Senior Nigerian and Sudanese people have said to me - \u2018Give us a fair price for our primary products and take your technical assistance and do what you like with it. We don\u2019t want to be obliged to you. You pay us what we\u2019ve earned and we\u2019ll hire the people we want to come and give us the assistance we need.\u2019</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>\u201cScripture in James 1-5 cries out, not for charity but for justice for agricultural producers.

I will attempt to summarise some of these concerns within this paper.</p>\n<p>The sentiments noted above by Dr Darling concerning the need to avoid paternalism remain highly applicable to the disaster risk and recovery field where my PhD supervisor, a leading figure in Development Practice, Professor Otto Koenigsberger, Head of DPU, once perceptively wrote a powerful challenge to the relief community:</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>\u2018<i>Relief is the enemy of recovery, so minimise relief to maximise recovery. Avoid paternalism at all costs. Assisting groups must never do what survivors can do or provide for themselves</i>.\u2019 <a class=\"anchor\" id=\"content100note2anc\" name=\"content100note2anc\">\u00a0</a><a class=\"note\" href=\"#content100note2sym\">[\u00a02\u00a0]</a></p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>\u2018<i>Relief is the enemy of recovery, so minimise relief to maximise recovery.

Wolterstorff reminds us that justice is the \u2018ground floor of shalom\u2019 and shalom consists of \u2018flourishing\u2019. This issue was beautifully captured in that famous speech by Martin Luther-King called : \u2018<a href=\"http://www.americanrhetoric.com/speeches/mlkivebeentothemountaintop.htm\">I\u2019ve Been to the Mountain Top</a>\u2019, delivered on April 3, 1968, the day before he was tragically assassinated:</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>\u00a0\u201c\u2026<i>.

The aim has been to achieve higher levels of security from the threats posed to lives, livelihoods, the natural environment and property by the devastating forces of earthquakes, volcanic activity, floods, droughts, high winds, climate change etc. I have worked in various roles: architect, consultant to UN Agencies, Governments and voluntary and private sectors and as an academic based in various universities. In the early 1970\u2019s the concerned community of individuals, agencies and academic bodies interested in disaster risk was comparatively small and isolated, but with the exponential increase in disaster threats the global risk reduction community has become extensive and more integrated, with a rapidly expanding political awareness.</p>\n<p>Reducing complex risks requires inter-disciplinary activity with concerted physical, environmental, social, economic and political actions. These processes, all aimed towards the creation of safe conditions, have been variously described as \u2018disaster mitigation\u2019, \u2018disaster preparedness\u2019, \u2018disaster risk reduction\u2019, \u2018disaster risk management\u2019, \u2018protective planning\u2019, \u2018adaptation to climate change\u2019 or \u2018the creation of resilient structures, institutions, societies and individuals\u2019.</p>\n<p>In this paper I seek to comment on disasters as the product, or consequence, of the relationship between hazards and vulnerability and to highlight some of the justice issues described by Wolterstorff that relate to this collision and the quest for safety. A caveat is needed since this short paper inevitably risks over-simplifying the complexity of the subject that has extensive literature across its many disciplines: engineering/ health/ development planning/ public policy etc. and references have been kept to a minimum.</p>\n<h2>Corruption Kills</h2>\n<p>Unresolved issues of justice and rights pervade the subject at all levels and in all sectors. Typical ethical questions that have attracted the attention of international conference delegates, academics and political leaders include: why are certain groups of people exposed to disaster risks?; what are the links between offering mercy and working for justice?; how are disaster risks generated, maintained and expanded?; who secures protection from disaster risks and why? and do communities have intrinsic rights to safety and who confers such rights?</p>\n<p>The collective focus of concern has centred on ways to counter an oppressive vulnerability and exposure and in many cases an acute lack of justice for vast millions of people suffering from unjust \u2013 often criminal policies and practices. Professor David Alexander (4) has recognised the pervasive corruption that lies at a high percentage of disaster deaths, injuries, and property damage:</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>\u201c<i>Corruption is an insidious problem that affects all societies, rich or poor.

First, the existence of a <b>Hazard: </b> a climatic, biological, hydrological or geo-physical event outside of human control and second - <b>Vulnerability</b> or <b>Exposure </b>to such events or processes, controlled by human societies. In a key paper of 1976, Phil O\u2019Keefe, Ken Westgate and Ben Wisner of the Disaster Research Centre in Bradford University argued the case that disasters are more a consequence of socio-economic than natural factors.<a class=\"anchor\" id=\"content100note5anc\" name=\"content100note5anc\">\u00a0</a><a class=\"note\" href=\"#content100note5sym\">[\u00a05\u00a0]</a> The negative impact of Hazard multiplied by Vulnerability can be reduced by increased <b>Capacity</b> that can include a diverse set of positive educational, physical and spiritual assets.</p>\n<p>Their insights could be expressed as a simple formula:</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p><b>\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 Hazard (H) x Vulnerability (V)<br/>\nDisaster Risk (R) = ------------------------------------------<br/>\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 Capacity (C)</b></p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>I then devised a rather basic \u2018Crunch Diagram\u2019 in 1978 based on these relationships that was included in my first book: \u2018<i>Shelter after Disaster\u2019.<a class=\"anchor\" id=\"content100note6anc\" name=\"content100note6anc\">\u00a0</a><a class=\"note\" href=\"#content100note6sym\">[\u00a06\u00a0]</a></i></p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p class=\"center\"><img alt=\"Initial Crunch Diagram\" class=\"inline-figure-600\" data-entity-type=\"file\" data-entity-uuid=\"89497740-e899-4864-80e6-5408df8113ac\" height=\"483\" loading=\"lazy\" src=\"https://facultyinitiative.net/sites/default/files/inline-images/davis_html_4394fac67465bd0f.jpg\" width=\"1079\"/></p>\n<p class=\"center\"><b>Fig.1.

Further Expansion to the Crunch Diagram, 2020</b></p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>The justice and rights issues that emerged in the subsequent development of the crunch diagram are highlighted above in Fig 2.</p>\n<p>The \u2018underlying causes\u2019, (sometimes called \u2018risk-drivers\u2019) are all deeply rooted aspects of un-development or social/ economic deprivation. They include poverty, racism, discrimination etc. The progression of vulnerability described in the diagram indicates how such forces can drive pressures that can ultimately lead to highly unsafe conditions. Research is needed to determine the nature, route and consequence of such connections in specific contexts.</p>\n<p>The essence of the diagram is that the standard political approach to risk reduction is to focus on addressing unsafe conditions, such as producing manuals for local builders on how to build safely. However, such worthy actions can be limited in their effectiveness, merely providing cosmetic attention to \u2018symptoms\u2019, leaving \u2018underlying causes\u2019 undisturbed. The entrenched reasons why buildings are unsafe and set on unsafe sites are thus sidestepped.</p>\n<p>Deeply rooted historical patterns of exploitation have been referred to in subsequent versions of the crunch model described as \u2018structural violence\u2019, \u2018historical patterns of underdevelopment\u2019, \u2018neo colonialism\u2019 and \u2018neo-liberalism\u2019.</p>\n<h2>Pre-Disaster Issues concerning Justice</h2>\n<h3>1. Siting of Settlements</h3>\n<p>Communities who live or work in highly unsafe sites are vulnerable to multiple hazards. For example, inhabiting steep slopes subject to rockfalls and landslides that can occur in high rainfall, earthquake impact, shorelines subject to river or coastal flooding or tsunami attack. Such sites may be occupied by communities living illegally on prohibited sites, or in some situations the authorities may have actually provided the land for housing development on sites they know to be highly dangerous.</p>\n<h3>2. Unsafe Construction</h3>\n<p>Dangerous construction practice is a common feature exposed in disaster damage assessments. Examples abound and include reinforced concrete with the corrupt omission of vital steel reinforcement, the substitution of sea-sand (costing nothing) containing corrosive salt in the concrete mix in lieu of prescribed pure sand (that has to be purchased). Dangerous construction can also result from ignorance concerning good, safe construction practice.</p>\n<h3>3. Corrupt Practice to avoid Regulations</h3>\n<p>Government building safety construction by- laws or land-use planning controls are often sidestepped by the taking of bribes by enforcement officials. The situation is often \u2018regularised\u2019 by Governments paying such officials low-wages based on the assumption they will top them up by the receipt of bribes</p>\n<p>In 1976 Guatemala experienced a devastating earthquake with over 23,000 deaths mainly resulting from unsafe construction of dwellings set on unsafe sites. A leading engineering seismologist - Professor N. Ambraseys from Imperial College reviewed the situation at a Royal Society Symposium where he predicted that: \u2018<i>Today\u2019s Act of God will be regarded as Tomorrow\u2019s Act of Criminal Negligence\u2019 . </i>Thirty-five years later in 2011 Ambraseys, writing with a leading US earthquake expert Professor Roger Bilham provided the evidence of the correlation between corruption and earthquake deaths as they analysed earthquake deaths against levels of national corruption as identified by the German based NGO \u2018<i>Transparancy International\u2019. </i>Their shocking conclusion in their paper: \u2018<i>Corruption Kills\u2019<a class=\"anchor\" id=\"content100note9anc\" name=\"content100note9anc\">\u00a0</a><a class=\"note\" href=\"#content100note9sym\">[\u00a09\u00a0]</a></i> was that 83% of all earthquake deaths over a thirty year period were the result of corruption that could be found in the design, construction and siting of unsafe dwellings. A lethal combination of action and inaction that weakened the promulgation, application, and enforcement of safety standards.</p>\n<h3>4. Witholding Risk Data</h3>\n<p>Governments often possess detailed assessments of potential risks facing their citizens, but for political control reasons fail to share this data with affected communities. This data may relate to risks associated with unsafe buildings, such as the structural safety of schools, or the occupation of unsafe sites as noted above. In other situations, unscrupulous land-owners have sold land knowing the risks while withholding the risk assessment data to house purchasers or house renters. (The blood pressure of the prophet Amos would have risen to boiling point over such evil practices!)</p>\n<h3>5. Risk-transfer</h3>\n<p>A common problem in the management of river flooding is for an upstream community to build safety measures for their communities that can increase downstream flooding \u2013 thus transferring and intensifying the risks facing others. In complex river catchments that cross national boundaries this practice can result in hostilities or \u2018river-wars\u2019.</p>\n<p>Currently, in June 2021, there is a dispute on this precise issue amongst communities living beside the River Thames. A flood protection measure for the <i>(upstream)</i> towns of Windsor and Maidenhead costing \u00a3110 million generated enhanced flooding for Wraysbury <i>(downstream)</i> but the towns of Windsor and Maidenhead have refused to contribute \u00a341 million to the cost of protection of the downstream communities.<a class=\"anchor\" id=\"content100note10anc\" name=\"content100note10anc\">\u00a0</a><a class=\"note\" href=\"#content100note10sym\">[\u00a010\u00a0]</a></p>\n<h3>6. Inaction by Governments</h3>\n<p>Governmental action is often found wanting, and this \u2018sin of omission\u2019 is certainly an issue of justice. Professor Ian Burton has noted that:</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>\u201c\u2026<i>decision makers often find themselves faced with pressures </i><i><u>not</u></i><i> to act or to delay decisions perhaps indefinitely. There is often a power structure and a set of political interests to which decision makers respond or comply with and fail to act in the best interests of the community as a whole in terms of risk and damage reduction. This power structure and political interests can be local, national and international (global) and there can also be expressions of private sector interests.\u201d<a class=\"anchor\" id=\"content100note11anc\" name=\"content100note11anc\">\u00a0</a><a class=\"note\" href=\"#content100note11sym\">[\u00a011\u00a0]</a></i></p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>\u201c\u2026<i>decision makers often find themselves faced with pressures </i><i><u>not</u></i><i> to act or to delay decisions perhaps indefinitely.

These underlying causal factors relate to corrupt practice and the denial of access of marginal, disadvantaged communities, or sections of communities such as women, to representation, resources, power and knowledge. Each of these risk drivers presents a formidable challenge for any concerned individual, local church, concerned agency or government. But we need to remind ourselves that we serve a living God who cares for any vulnerable exploited community and takes positive delight in our faith and obedience to \u2018move mountains\u2019.</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>\"<i>If you have\u00a0</i><i>faith</i><i>\u00a0as small as a mustard seed, you can say to this\u00a0</i><i>mountain</i><i>, \u2019</i><i>Move</i><i>\u00a0from here to there,\u2019 and it will\u00a0</i><i>move</i><i>.

    "bodyText": "The content of natural science concerns itself with what is \u2014 not what ought to be. Natural science is experimental and observational. It studies the repeatable, and what appear to be the unchanging and normally inescapable principles that govern the working of the natural world. Its theoretical explanations are required to observe intellectual standards of clarity, self-consistency, logic, and mathematical rigor, some of which are common to non-science disciplines too. But natural science is founded on the authority of nature: of reproducible experiment and observation, to which theoretical speculations must ultimately conform if they are to be accepted. Moreover, science\u2019s whole approach to explanation is to set aside intentionality, and personality, instead seeking explanations in terms of efficient causes.\n\nSuperficially, then, what science finds out does not appear to demand an assessment of worth, or goodness, beyond the material and pragmatic. It is not prima-facie about human or any other personal value. And that has led to a view that its contents (though not its institutions) are free from ideological or religious bias: that its knowledge is purely detached and factual. Postmodern critiques aside, most scientists do regard science\u2019s findings as objective.\n\nThat does not mean all scientists view their discipline as lacking in wider, or perhaps even transcendent significance; nor are they necessarily unemotional; nor are aesthetic or ethical considerations excluded from their thinking or practice. But it does mean that when scientists discuss justice in their discipline they mostly focus on scientific social practice and applications, not on the content of scientific knowledge. This social perspective has become even more obvious recently as professional scientific societies have responded to critiques from minority groups about inequity and bias. Social diversity, equity and inclusion have become a major preoccupation in professional societies. And it shows up when the application of science, especially its commercial application, is seen as its main justifying rationale. The underlying ethical principles and values on which such discussions proceed come from outside science, whether scientists realize it or not. Here I want instead (or perhaps in addition) to suggest that natural science has priorities, which can reasonably be considered matters of justice, that derive from nature itself. Doing justice to nature is something both science and all of human endeavor should take as a priority.\n\nIf, as Wolterstorff says, first order justice derives from excellence (goodness, worth, dignity, praise-worthiness), are there not aspects of the natural world that possess this sort of excel- lence, and are there not important features of the very content of science that call for just recognition?\n\nThe Christian and Jewish scriptures, in countless places celebrate the natural world (e.g. Gen 1:31, Ps 8, Ps 96:1-6), its goodness, wonder, majesty, power, and beauty; and they also praise it as the ongoing gift and creation of God (Ps 65:9-13, 95:4-5, 104). Are these excellences the foundation of what constitutes justice in respect of nature? And are they perhaps even a major part of what undergirds the just practice of science?\n\nEven the most secular of scientists and science commentators are unashamed to celebrate the awesome character of the universe, the wonder and mystery of what governs quantum and sub-atomic physics, and the intricacies of the biosphere. When doing so, are they recognizing something that truly goes beyond the impersonal and pragmatic, or are they just being led by their inescapable humanity into a spurious emotionalism? Christian teaching is that the awesome character of the universe is in fact attributable to the will and wisdom of a personal Creator, and that in engaging scientifically with nature we are engaging with the excellences of a creation.\n\nAs a Christian, I see my professional science as engaging with the natural world in a way that does justice to its excellence, worth, and dignity, which is a reflection of the character of God. In doing so, I stand in a historic tradition of people of religious faith who have seen intrinsic worth in knowing and understanding the working principles of nature. Such abstract knowledge is not in conflict with a call to practicality; indeed it can be argued that Francis Bacon\u2019s call to knowledge \u201cfor the relief of man\u2019s estate\u201d was a vital stimulus to abandon purely speculative knowledge, and focus for charity\u2019s sake on reproducible experimental demonstration, which undergirds modern science. However, there is, in a society dominated by the technological application of science, a vital need to balance practical and commercial interests with the call to do justice to nature not just in the employment of technology in human society, but also in our valuing of the excellence and worth of the natural world. Thus, pure science is valuable foundationally because of the excellence, worth, dignity, and praise-worthiness of the creation, recognizable by all regardless of theology, but recognized by the faithful as a part of their spiritual understanding.\n\nSince natural science is concerned with the reproducible and unambiguous aspects of the world, its successful pursuit demands, and eventually rewards, certain practices that have a moral character. Perhaps foremost among these is truthfulness. Of all the virtues, truth is perhaps the one most explicitly attributed to Jesus (Jn 1:14 \u201cthe Word became flesh and dwelt among us, full of grace and truth\u201d, Jn 14:6 \u201cI am the way, the truth, and the life\u201d, etc.) and enjoined on Christians (1 Cor 5:8, 2 Cor 6:7, Eph 4:25, etc.) Science demands truthful observing and reporting. This is a discipline that requires a certain unselfish honesty, and echoes Biblical calls that serious Christians take seriously. Perhaps that is one reason for the very influential role played by Christians in the development of modern science. Personal discipline, important though it is, has never been sufficient on its own; and science has also institutional practices that seek to enforce truthfulness and uncover error or (self-)deception. It was once relatively straightforward for observational or experimental reports to be checked and reproduced by other natural philosophers, and for scientific discoveries to be quickly confirmed or dismissed. Moreover, when science was predominantly a pastime for enthusiastic amateurs rather than a source of wealth, the only personal benefit to be ob- tained from it was reputation. Today it is far more difficult to detect incompetence, error, or deception because of science\u2019s complexity. And the potential personal advantages are considerably more tempting. Truth has recently become more difficult to establish and less practically compelling, with regrettable consequences. In many scientific fields there is a cri- sis of reproducibility, and in virtually all of science there is a glut of unreliable and incorrect journal articles, fed by the now negligible cost of publication and dissemination. These are injustices, I suggest, not merely because of the cost, trouble, or suffering that they impose on others, but also because they fail to render to nature the truth that is its due.\n\nEnvironmental Justice is a phrase widely invoked today that seems to suggest that there is such a thing as justice toward nature. A major discussion thread that often dominates the development of what environmental justice means is equitable human sharing of natural resources. Wolterstorff has argued that this sort of \u201cdistributive justice\u201d, while important, is just one facet of first-order justice. Nevertheless he speaks almost entirely of \u201cagents\u201d (including social entities) as being the givers and receivers of justice. Beyond that, I want to propose that there is a meaningful sense in which the relationship of humans to the natural world calls us not only to do justice to our fellow humans, but also to do justice to nature. If so, then it would be too narrow a characterization to say that justice concerns rendering to other agents their right or due. Instead, unconscious or even inanimate features of creation are owed their just due. And these \u201crights\u201d might well compete with the desires or \u201crights\u201d of people or other agents. [\u00a01\u00a0]\n\nThis also is a profoundly Biblical idea, encapsulated in the Old Testament primacy of Sabbath (Deut 5:12-14) and Jubilee (Lev 25:8-22). As one of the ten commandments, ob- serving the Sabbath is certainly in part about justice toward employees and servants, and in part about acting justly toward God in worship. But it is also about rest for the land, for animals, and for nature. Rest for the land is, of course, a recognition by the religious instruction of the hebrews that an agricultural society\u2019s flourishing depends on the health of fields, which is promoted by avoiding over-utilization. But it is also a recognition of what we justly owe to the care and stewardship of creation, because of its intrinsic worth. Creation care is a duty for humans, not just for reasons of self-interest, but also for justice toward nature.\n\nWhat, as a consequence, do we owe to the study of nature? What moral and ethical priorities does science demand? And do those priorities (those \u201crights\u201d) moderate, constrain, or conflict with other rights claims?\n\nIt is perhaps obvious that, when investigating the biology of humans, ethical constraints on what is acceptable experimental practice should be enforced. It is uncontroversial to see these as a matter of justice. But the puzzles seem to me considerably more difficult when it comes to the justice of animal experiments. Do animals have rights, and if so which animals, and what rights? Beyond the animal kingdom, does the environment, the oceans, the atmosphere, the landscape, the planet have rights? Is there a question of justice in recognizing their excellence and worthiness? Is it justice that is violated by pollution, excessive consumption, or other environmental exploitation?\n\nHere is where utilitarianism most obviously falls short of providing properly grounded ethics. It can presume some value or values based on human survival or prosperity, but it cannot justify any value, worth, or dignity derived from the character of non-human nature. It can cash in the emotional or aesthetic appreciation that many people feel toward the natural world, but it cannot attribute an intrinsic value or excellence to nature, possessed independent of humans. Christian teaching does attribute high worth to humans \u2014 because God loves us. But, rightly understood, that worth does not over-ride the worth of the rest of creation, because God loves it too. Nature deserves to be valued by us humans. And science is a discipline that places high value on understanding it. Perhaps, then, justice toward nature, based on its excellence and praise-worthiness, is a compelling, and Christ-worthy, ethical priority.\n\nWhen the flourishing of humans and of nature seem to be in conflict with one another, I believe that a proper balance can be greatly facilitated by seeing both priorities as being about justice based on what is due. Natural science at its best can foster this understanding.\n\n[\u00a01\u00a0] Wolterstorff\u2019s discussion of justice does not address what seems to me a crucial difficulty in a \u201crights\u201d perspective, which is that different rights often do compete; so an absolute assertion that a right trumps other considerations is impractical.",
    "bodyHtml": "<p>The content of natural science concerns itself with what is \u2014 not what ought to be. Natural science is experimental and observational. It studies the repeatable, and what appear to be the unchanging and normally inescapable principles that govern the working of the natural world. Its theoretical explanations are required to observe intellectual standards of clarity, self-consistency, logic, and mathematical rigor, some of which are common to non-science disciplines too. But natural science is founded on the authority of nature: of reproducible experiment and observation, to which theoretical speculations must ultimately conform if they are to be accepted. Moreover, science\u2019s whole approach to explanation is to set aside intentionality, and personality, instead seeking explanations in terms of efficient causes.</p>\n<p>Superficially, then, what science finds out does not appear to demand an assessment of worth, or goodness, beyond the material and pragmatic. It is not prima-facie about human or any other personal value. And that has led to a view that its contents (though not its institutions) are free from ideological or religious bias: that its knowledge is purely detached and factual. Postmodern critiques aside, most scientists do regard science\u2019s findings as objective.</p>\n<p>That does not mean all scientists view their discipline as lacking in wider, or perhaps even transcendent significance; nor are they necessarily unemotional; nor are aesthetic or ethical considerations excluded from their thinking or practice. But it does mean that when scientists discuss justice in their discipline they mostly focus on scientific social practice and applications, not on the content of scientific knowledge. This social perspective has become even more obvious recently as professional scientific societies have responded to critiques from minority groups about inequity and bias. Social diversity, equity and inclusion have become a major preoccupation in professional societies. And it shows up when the application of science, especially its commercial application, is seen as its main justifying rationale. The underlying ethical principles and values on which such discussions proceed come from outside science, whether scientists realize it or not. Here I want instead (or perhaps in addition) to suggest that natural science has priorities, which can reasonably be considered matters of justice, that derive from nature itself. Doing justice to nature is something both science and all of human endeavor should take as a priority.</p>\n<h2>Justice in Science</h2>\n<p>If, as Wolterstorff says, first order justice derives from excellence (goodness, worth, dignity, praise-worthiness), are there not aspects of the natural world that possess this sort of excel- lence, and are there not important features of the very content of science that call for just recognition?</p>\n<p>The Christian and Jewish scriptures, in countless places celebrate the natural world (e.g. Gen 1:31, Ps 8, Ps 96:1-6), its goodness, wonder, majesty, power, and beauty; and they also praise it as the ongoing gift and creation of God (Ps 65:9-13, 95:4-5, 104). Are these excellences the foundation of what constitutes justice in respect of nature? And are they perhaps even a major part of what undergirds the just practice of science?</p>\n<p>Even the most secular of scientists and science commentators are unashamed to celebrate the awesome character of the universe, the wonder and mystery of what governs quantum and sub-atomic physics, and the intricacies of the biosphere. When doing so, are they recognizing something that truly goes beyond the impersonal and pragmatic, or are they just being led by their inescapable humanity into a spurious emotionalism? Christian teaching is that the awesome character of the universe is in fact attributable to the will and wisdom of a personal Creator, and that in engaging scientifically with nature we are engaging with the excellences of a creation.</p>\n<p>As a Christian, I see my professional science as engaging with the natural world in a way that does justice to its excellence, worth, and dignity, which is a reflection of the character of God. In doing so, I stand in a historic tradition of people of religious faith who have seen intrinsic worth in knowing and understanding the working principles of nature. Such abstract knowledge is not in conflict with a call to practicality; indeed it can be argued that Francis Bacon\u2019s call to knowledge \u201cfor the relief of man\u2019s estate\u201d was a vital stimulus to abandon purely speculative knowledge, and focus for charity\u2019s sake on reproducible experimental demonstration, which undergirds modern science. However, there is, in a society dominated by the technological application of science, a vital need to balance practical and commercial interests with the call to do justice to nature not just in the employment of technology in human society, but also in our valuing of the excellence and worth of the natural world. Thus, pure science is valuable foundationally because of the excellence, worth, dignity, and praise-worthiness of the creation, recognizable by all regardless of theology, but recognized by the faithful as a part of their spiritual understanding.</p>\n<p>Since natural science is concerned with the reproducible and unambiguous aspects of the world, its successful pursuit demands, and eventually rewards, certain practices that have a moral character. Perhaps foremost among these is truthfulness. Of all the virtues, truth is perhaps the one most explicitly attributed to Jesus (Jn 1:14 \u201cthe Word became flesh and dwelt among us, full of grace and truth\u201d, Jn 14:6 \u201cI am the way, the truth, and the life\u201d, etc.) and enjoined on Christians (1 Cor 5:8, 2 Cor 6:7, Eph 4:25, etc.) Science demands truthful observing and reporting. This is a discipline that requires a certain unselfish honesty, and echoes Biblical calls that serious Christians take seriously. Perhaps that is one reason for the very influential role played by Christians in the development of modern science. Personal discipline, important though it is, has never been sufficient on its own; and science has also institutional practices that seek to enforce truthfulness and uncover error or (self-)deception. It was once relatively straightforward for observational or experimental reports to be checked and reproduced by other natural philosophers, and for scientific discoveries to be quickly confirmed or dismissed. Moreover, when science was predominantly a pastime for enthusiastic amateurs rather than a source of wealth, the only personal benefit to be ob- tained from it was reputation. Today it is far more difficult to detect incompetence, error, or deception because of science\u2019s complexity. And the potential personal advantages are considerably more tempting. Truth has recently become more difficult to establish and less practically compelling, with regrettable consequences. In many scientific fields there is a cri- sis of reproducibility, and in virtually all of science there is a glut of unreliable and incorrect journal articles, fed by the now negligible cost of publication and dissemination. These are injustices, I suggest, not merely because of the cost, trouble, or suffering that they impose on others, but also because they fail to render to nature the truth that is its due.</p>\n<h2>Just Treatment of Nature</h2>\n<p>Environmental Justice is a phrase widely invoked today that seems to suggest that there is such a thing as justice toward nature. A major discussion thread that often dominates the development of what environmental justice means is equitable human sharing of natural resources. Wolterstorff has argued that this sort of \u201cdistributive justice\u201d, while important, is just one facet of first-order justice. Nevertheless he speaks almost entirely of \u201cagents\u201d (including social entities) as being the givers and receivers of justice. Beyond that, I want to propose that there is a meaningful sense in which the relationship of humans to the natural world calls us not only to do justice to our fellow humans, but also to do justice to nature. If so, then it would be too narrow a characterization to say that justice concerns rendering to other <i>agents </i>their right or due. Instead, unconscious or even inanimate features of creation are owed their just due. And these \u201crights\u201d might well compete with the desires or \u201crights\u201d of people or other agents.<a class=\"anchor\" id=\"content100note1anc\" name=\"content100note1anc\">\u00a0</a><a class=\"note\" href=\"#content100note1sym\">[\u00a01\u00a0]</a></p>\n<p>This also is a profoundly Biblical idea, encapsulated in the Old Testament primacy of Sabbath (Deut 5:12-14) and Jubilee (Lev 25:8-22).

    "bodyText": "Prof. Wolterstorff uses the term \u2018first-order justice\u2019 to describe \u2018the type of justice that consists of agents acting justly in their ordinary affairs\u2019, including (but not restricted to) \u2018justice in the distribution of benefits and/or burdens\u2019 (p. 7). As I understand it, this conception of just action is deeply rooted in a vision of a just social order \u2013 a world in which human beings are treated fairly and in which their rights are respected by other individuals and social entities. First-order justice, in this sense, \u2018is structurally basic\u2019, whereas second-order justice is designed to redress violations of it. Public policy, Prof. Wolterstorff suggests, can be directed both towards the achievement of \u2018first-order justice among individuals and social entities\u2019 and to the development of \u2018laws and procedures\u2019 which ensure that punishment and restitution are carried out consistently and fairly (p. 7). Prof. Wolterstorff\u2019s conception of second-order justice is primarily a judicial one, exemplified by \u2018police, court proceedings, punishment, prisons, and the like\u2019 (p. 7). However, he is clear that second-order justice can be restorative as well as punitive , and I think the concept might productively be extended to the forms of compensation, restitution, and redistribution which the state carries out in the economic sphere.\n\nThough I am not a biblical scholar, it seems to me that the vision of economic justice which the Old Testament gives us is set out primarily in first-order terms. The Mosaic Law provides for economic security through the distribution of the land, underpinned by the principle of the Jubilee, which acts as a safeguard against both excessive concentration of agricultural property and permanent alienation from economic resources (Leviticus 25). The prophet Micah, too, relates economic security to property ownership, looking to a time when \u2018everyone will sit under their own vine and under their own fig tree, and no one will make them afraid\u2019 (Micah 4:4). At the same time, the provision for gleaning, which gives \u2018the poor and the sojourner\u2019 an implicit right to food (Leviticus 19: 9-10), shows a frank recognition that not everyone will enjoy such material security. Throughout the Bible, the people of God are also enjoined to be just, impartial, and generous in their economic relations, particularly towards those in need. In other words, economic justice is to be achieved both through the structure of the social order and through a distinctive social ethic, grounded in respect for other human beings and a recognition of one\u2019s own dependence on God.\n\nThe agrarian subsistence economy of ancient Israel is, of course, a world away from the highly globalized, industrialized, and financialized economy of modern western states. Well into the modern era, however, I think it is fair to say that economic rights have been conceptualized in concrete terms which would not have been wholly unfamiliar to the biblical writers. Land reform has been a perennial subject of political debate, and remains so in many parts of the world; even in the UK, it is barely a century since David Lloyd George\u2019s plans for land taxation provoked a constitutional stand-off with the House of Lords, and during the ensuing 1910 elections Liberal meetings resounded with the Land Song (\u2018God gave the land to the people\u2019). Likewise, cheap food was a major theme of British politics right up to the 1970s, held up as one of the main benefits of free trade (as Frank Trentmann has shown in Free Trade Nation (2008)) and allegedly imperiled by the UK\u2019s entry into the European Economic Community. [\u00a01\u00a0] The notion of \u2018a fair day\u2019s wage for a fair day\u2019s work\u2019 was central to trade union activity, often equated (in a male-breadwinner era) with a \u2018family wage\u2019 \u2013 an income sufficient to support a man, his wife, and three children. Notions of a \u2018just wage\u2019 and a \u2018just price\u2019 structured what E.P. Thompson called a \u2018moral economy\u2019, rooted in everyday custom and practice but often also reflected in government policy. [\u00a02\u00a0] Catholic social theorists and economists (such as Michael Fogarty in Britain) were particularly active in translating these concepts of economic justice into an industrial context. [\u00a03\u00a0]\n\nUntil the middle of the twentieth century, then, economic rights were largely understood in academic as well as popular discourse in terms of a specific set of human needs: food, fuel, housing, clothing, education, and health care. Access to these goods could be guaranteed either directly or by ensuring that citizens had sufficient resources to pay for them. Indeed, the expansion of social provision and trade union rights in the UK and other western democracies during the first half of the twentieth century was strongly informed by this line of thinking. Governments sought to make the real economy \u2018fair\u2019 in a way that their citizens understood through policies such as price subsidies, rent controls, centralized systems of wage bargaining, and direct forms of social provision such as council housing.\n\nSince the Second World War, however, this \u2018first-order approach\u2019 to achieving economic justice has been steadily eroded by the influence of neoclassical welfare economics and the growth of increasingly abstract conceptions of poverty and inequality. Post-war liberal thinkers have generally held that collective provision of goods and services is economically inefficient and morally paternalistic (except in specific fields such as health and education) and that cash transfers are therefore preferable. [\u00a04\u00a0] With the onset of deindustrialization since the 1960s and 70s, governments\u2019 ability to meet expectations of \u2018fair work\u2019 \u2013 particularly for male manual workers \u2013 have also waned. As a result, social policy has increasingly been structured by a logic of compensation in which cash transfers bridge the gap between what citizens or policy-makers think is \u2018fair\u2019 and what the market economy delivers. [\u00a05\u00a0] John Kay has characterized this approach as \u2018redistributive market liberalism\u2019, and I have suggested in my book Transfer State (Oxford, 2019) that it explains much of the popularity of proposals for a Negative Income Tax or Universal Basic Income, which would provide a guaranteed minimum income for the whole population. [\u00a06\u00a0] The parallels with Rawlsian conceptions of distributive justice \u2013 focussed on establishing what degree of inequality can be ethically justified \u2013 are, I think, quite clear. [\u00a07\u00a0]\n\nThe practical implications are perhaps best illustrated by the way the Blair government framed its child poverty strategy in the early 2000s. Child poverty was conceptualized in relative income terms (a child was \u2018poor\u2019 if he or she lived in a household whose equivalized income was less than 60 per cent of the median equivalized income), and Gordon Brown\u2019s strategy for eliminating it by 2020 revolved around an expansive system of tax credits for low- and middle-income families with children. [\u00a08\u00a0] Such policies have helped to take the edge off the sharp rise in inequality which the UK has experienced in recent decades as a result of deindustrialization and free-market economic policies. Whilst the Gini coefficient (which measures the degree of inequality in a country) for market incomes rose from 0.38 in 1975 to 0.52 in 2010, the Gini coefficient for disposable incomes rose only from 0.27 to 0.34. Despite historically high employment levels and a spate of austerity measures over the last decade, cash transfers have come to play a major role in supplementing earned income not only for the unemployed and the disabled but for many low-paid workers, especially those in households with children. [\u00a09\u00a0] The logic of the US Earned Income Tax Credit and Child Tax Credit \u2013 the latter recently, if temporarily, expanded under President Biden\u2019s American Rescue Plan \u2013 is very similar.\n\nFrom a policy perspective, the shift from a first-order to a second-order approach to economic justice makes a good deal of sense. After all, the practical record of state intervention in labour and product markets has been distinctly uneven, so if politicians can achieve their social objectives without risking heavy-handed forms of government failure, that is bound to be appealing to many policy-makers. The decoupling of economic security from paid work may also be welcome on moral and ethical grounds, since the Fordist labour-market model of the mid-twentieth-century was premised on a male-breadwinner family structure and tended to reinforce gendered patterns of dependency within the household. Finally, we might welcome the fact that cash transfers expand citizens\u2019 autonomy and choice, whilst insisting that a Christian conception of moral agency will always entail much more than control over private consumption.\n\nA strong current of recent scholarship has argued, however, that the politics of compensation or redistribution is politically weak and is liable to face a growing legitimacy crisis. [\u00a010\u00a0] The problem is threefold:\n\nFirstly, once economic rights are untethered from the concrete goods required for subsistence (or flourishing) and from people\u2019s daily experience of making a living, they are likely to seem increasingly abstract and arbitrary: a matter of political fiat rather than the expression of a deeper moral economy.\n\nSecondly, the pattern of production, prices, and rewards produced by the market is likely to appear increasingly normal and natural \u2013 at least to its beneficiaries \u2013 since citizens cannot easily see the ways in which market outcomes are shaped by government policies.\n\nThirdly, the process of redistribution requires constant government activity: if at any point the transfer machine is turned off, the market is likely to produce quite extreme concentrations of wealth and economic power.\n\nThe practical result is that liberal and social-democratic politicians have found themselves increasingly struggling to justify and explain patterns of redistribution, especially in periods of actual or perceived fiscal crisis. This can be seen not only in the contested politics of \u2018welfare\u2019 (where the current UK government has tightened conditionality rules and encouraged tabloid attacks on perceived \u2018scroungers\u2019) but also in debates over foreign aid spending. The UN target of spending 0.7% of gross national income on overseas development assistance appears arbitrary because it is arbitrary. On the other hand, it is not easy to see how a first-order vision of global economic justice might be operationalized as a basis for public policy in the UK and other affluent countries.\n\nFirstly, is it meaningful and useful to apply the distinction between first- and second-order justice to the economic sphere in this way, or am I stretching the concept too far? (Perhaps I am.)\n\nSecondly, is there any theological reason for Christians to prefer policies which seek to achieve economic justice by acting directly on the real economy rather than by the \u2018second-order\u2019 means of redistributive transfers, or is this choice simply a matter of economic judgment and political strategy?\n\nPeter Sloman, Transfer State: The Idea of a Guaranteed Income and the Politics of Redistribution in Modern Britain (Oxford, 2019), explores how attitudes to redistribution have changed in Britain over the last century and how these ideas have shaped policy responses to poverty and inequality.\n\nMalcolm Torry, Citizen\u2019s Basic Income: A Christian Social Policy (2016), develops a Christian case for a Universal Basic Income.\n\nTim Rogan, The Moral Economists: R.H. Tawney, Karl Polanyi, E.P. Thompson, and the Critique of Capitalism (Princeton, 2017) examines how moral and ethical concerns permeated twentieth-century critiques of capitalism.\n\nJim Tomlinson, \u2018Distributional politics: The search for equality in Britain since the First World War\u2019, in Pat Hudson and Keith Tribe (eds.), The Contradictions of Capital in the Twenty-First Century (Newcastle-upon-Tyne, 2016), offers a lively analysis of approaches to equality in UK public policy.\n\n[\u00a01\u00a0] Frank Trentmann, Free Trade Nation: Commerce, Consumption and Civil Society in Modern Britain (Oxford, 2008); Robert Saunders, Yes to Europe! The 1975 Referendum and Seventies Britain (Cambridge, 2018), pp. 278-96.\n\n[\u00a02\u00a0] On this topic, see especially E.P. Thompson, \u2018The moral economy of the English crowd in the eighteenth century\u2019, Past & Present , 50 (1971), and Jim Tomlinson, \u2018Re-inventing the \u201cmoral economy\u201d in post-war Britain\u2019, Historical Research , 84 (2011).\n\n[\u00a03\u00a0] For Fogarty\u2019s work, see especially M.P. Fogarty, The Just Wage (1961) and Michael Fogarty, My Life and Ours (Oxford, 1999).\n\n[\u00a04\u00a0] This point is perhaps best illustrated by comparing the discussions of social policy in A.C. Pigou\u2019s The Economics of Welfare (1920) and James Meade\u2019s Planning and the Price Mechanism (1948). Pigou favoured a collectivist approach to welfare provision because he worried that cash transfers would discourage work and that parents would not know how best to spend money on their children; Meade, on the other hand, writing from the other side of the socialist calculation debate and the Second World War, was more sceptical of collective provision and more sympathetic to cash transfer schemes.\n\n[\u00a05\u00a0] The idea of compensation, of course, lies at the heart of new welfare economics in the form of the Kaldor-Hicks criterion.\n\n[\u00a06\u00a0] John Kay, \u2018Staking a moral claim\u2019, New Statesman , 11 Oct. 1996. Milton Friedman and George Stigler devised the Negative Income Tax as a way of using the income tax system to provide a targeted income supplement for families with low incomes. By contrast, a Universal Basic Income involves a universal, non-income-tested benefit paid by the state to every individual.\n\n[\u00a07\u00a0] It is true that John Rawls was primarily interested in enabling citizens to interact as social and political equals, and so was more concerned about the structure of social institutions and access to \u2018primary goods\u2019 (including civil liberties and \u2018the social bases of self-respect\u2019) than the distribution of material resources. Yet Rawls\u2019 famous \u2018difference principle\u2019 was frequently conceptualized in income terms, and in A Theory of Justice (1971) he explicitly suggested that the state should use a Negative Income Tax to establish a \u2018social minimum\u2019 outside the labour market.

    "bodyHtml": "<p>Prof. Wolterstorff uses the term \u2018first-order justice\u2019 to describe \u2018the type of justice that consists of agents acting justly in their ordinary affairs\u2019, including (but not restricted to) \u2018justice in the distribution of benefits and/or burdens\u2019 (p. 7). As I understand it, this conception of just <i>action</i> is deeply rooted in a vision of a just social <i>order</i> \u2013 a world in which human beings are treated fairly and in which their rights are respected by other individuals and social entities. First-order justice, in this sense, \u2018is structurally basic\u2019, whereas second-order justice is designed to redress violations of it. Public policy, Prof. Wolterstorff suggests, can be directed <i>both </i>towards the achievement of \u2018first-order justice among individuals and social entities\u2019 <i>and</i> to the development of \u2018laws and procedures\u2019 which ensure that punishment and restitution are carried out consistently and fairly (p. 7). Prof. Wolterstorff\u2019s conception of second-order justice is primarily a judicial one, exemplified by \u2018police, court proceedings, punishment, prisons, and the like\u2019 (p. 7). However, he is clear that second-order justice can be <i>restorative </i>as well as <i>punitive</i>, and I think<i> </i>the concept might productively be extended to the forms of compensation, restitution, and redistribution which the state carries out in the economic sphere.</p>\n<p>Though I am not a biblical scholar, it seems to me that the vision of economic justice which the Old Testament gives us is set out primarily in first-order terms. The Mosaic Law provides for economic security through the distribution of the land, underpinned by the principle of the Jubilee, which acts as a safeguard against both excessive concentration of agricultural property and permanent alienation from economic resources (Leviticus 25). The prophet Micah, too, relates economic security to property ownership, looking to a time when \u2018everyone will sit under their own vine and under their own fig tree, and no one will make them afraid\u2019 (Micah 4:4). At the same time, the provision for gleaning, which gives \u2018the poor and the sojourner\u2019 an implicit right to food (Leviticus 19: 9-10), shows a frank recognition that not everyone will enjoy such material security. Throughout the Bible, the people of God are also enjoined to be just, impartial, and generous in their economic relations, particularly towards those in need. In other words, economic justice is to be achieved <i>both </i>through the structure of the social order <i>and</i> through a distinctive social ethic, grounded in respect for other human beings and a recognition of one\u2019s own dependence on God.</p>\n<p>The agrarian subsistence economy of ancient Israel is, of course, a world away from the highly globalized, industrialized, and financialized economy of modern western states. Well into the modern era, however, I think it is fair to say that economic rights have been conceptualized in <i>concrete</i> terms which would not have been wholly unfamiliar to the biblical writers. Land reform has been a perennial subject of political debate, and remains so in many parts of the world; even in the UK, it is barely a century since David Lloyd George\u2019s plans for land taxation provoked a constitutional stand-off with the House of Lords, and during the ensuing 1910 elections Liberal meetings resounded with the Land Song (\u2018God gave the land to the people\u2019). Likewise, cheap food was a major theme of British politics right up to the 1970s, held up as one of the main benefits of free trade (as Frank Trentmann has shown in <i>Free Trade Nation </i>(2008)) and allegedly imperiled by the UK\u2019s entry into the European Economic Community.<a class=\"anchor\" id=\"content100note1anc\" name=\"content100note1anc\">\u00a0</a><a class=\"note\" href=\"#content100note1sym\">[\u00a01\u00a0]</a> The notion of \u2018a fair day\u2019s wage for a fair day\u2019s work\u2019 was central to trade union activity, often equated (in a male-breadwinner era) with a \u2018family wage\u2019 \u2013 an income sufficient to support a man, his wife, and three children. Notions of a \u2018just wage\u2019 and a \u2018just price\u2019 structured what E.P. Thompson called a \u2018moral economy\u2019, rooted in everyday custom and practice but often also reflected in government policy.<a class=\"anchor\" id=\"content100note2anc\" name=\"content100note2anc\">\u00a0</a><a class=\"note\" href=\"#content100note2sym\">[\u00a02\u00a0]</a> Catholic social theorists and economists (such as Michael Fogarty in Britain) were particularly active in translating these concepts of economic justice into an industrial context.<a class=\"anchor\" id=\"content100note3anc\" name=\"content100note3anc\">\u00a0</a><a class=\"note\" href=\"#content100note3sym\">[\u00a03\u00a0]</a></p>\n<p>Until the middle of the twentieth century, then, economic rights were largely understood in academic as well as popular discourse in terms of a specific set of human needs: food, fuel, housing, clothing, education, and health care. Access to these goods could be guaranteed either directly or by ensuring that citizens had sufficient resources to pay for them. Indeed, the expansion of social provision and trade union rights in the UK and other western democracies during the first half of the twentieth century was strongly informed by this line of thinking. Governments sought to make the real economy \u2018fair\u2019 in a way that their citizens understood through policies such as price subsidies, rent controls, centralized systems of wage bargaining, and direct forms of social provision such as council housing.</p>\n<h2>From First-Order to Second-Order Economic Justice</h2>\n<p>Since the Second World War, however, this \u2018first-order approach\u2019 to achieving economic justice has been steadily eroded by the influence of neoclassical welfare economics and the growth of increasingly abstract conceptions of poverty and inequality. Post-war liberal thinkers have generally held that collective provision of goods and services is economically inefficient and morally paternalistic (except in specific fields such as health and education) and that cash transfers are therefore preferable.<a class=\"anchor\" id=\"content100note4anc\" name=\"content100note4anc\">\u00a0</a><a class=\"note\" href=\"#content100note4sym\">[\u00a04\u00a0]</a> With the onset of deindustrialization since the 1960s and 70s, governments\u2019 ability to meet expectations of \u2018fair work\u2019 \u2013 particularly for male manual workers \u2013 have also waned. As a result, social policy has increasingly been structured by a logic of <i>compensation </i>in which cash transfers bridge the gap between what citizens or policy-makers think is \u2018fair\u2019 and what the market economy delivers.<a class=\"anchor\" id=\"content100note5anc\" name=\"content100note5anc\">\u00a0</a><a class=\"note\" href=\"#content100note5sym\">[\u00a05\u00a0]</a> John Kay has characterized this approach as \u2018redistributive market liberalism\u2019, and I have suggested in my book <i>Transfer State </i>(Oxford, 2019) that it explains much of the popularity of proposals for a Negative Income Tax or Universal Basic Income, which would provide a guaranteed minimum income for the whole population.<a class=\"anchor\" id=\"content100note6anc\" name=\"content100note6anc\">\u00a0</a><a class=\"note\" href=\"#content100note6sym\">[\u00a06\u00a0]</a> The parallels with Rawlsian conceptions of distributive justice \u2013 focussed on establishing what degree of inequality can be ethically justified \u2013 are, I think, quite clear.<a class=\"anchor\" id=\"content100note7anc\" name=\"content100note7anc\">\u00a0</a><a class=\"note\" href=\"#content100note7sym\">[\u00a07\u00a0]</a></p>\n<p>The practical implications are perhaps best illustrated by the way the Blair government framed its child poverty strategy in the early 2000s. Child poverty was conceptualized in relative income terms (a child was \u2018poor\u2019 if he or she lived in a household whose equivalized income was less than 60 per cent of the median equivalized income), and Gordon Brown\u2019s strategy for eliminating it by 2020 revolved around an expansive system of tax credits for low- and middle-income families with children.<a class=\"anchor\" id=\"content100note8anc\" name=\"content100note8anc\">\u00a0</a><a class=\"note\" href=\"#content100note8sym\">[\u00a08\u00a0]</a> Such policies have helped to take the edge off the sharp rise in inequality which the UK has experienced in recent decades as a result of deindustrialization and free-market economic policies. Whilst the Gini coefficient (which measures the degree of inequality in a country) for <i>market</i> incomes rose from 0.38 in 1975 to 0.52 in 2010, the Gini coefficient for <i>disposable</i> incomes rose only from 0.27 to 0.34. Despite historically high employment levels and a spate of austerity measures over the last decade, cash transfers have come to play a major role in supplementing earned income not only for the unemployed and the disabled but for many low-paid workers, especially those in households with children.<a class=\"anchor\" id=\"content100note9anc\" name=\"content100note9anc\">\u00a0</a><a class=\"note\" href=\"#content100note9sym\">[\u00a09\u00a0]</a> The logic of the US Earned Income Tax Credit and Child Tax Credit \u2013 the latter recently, if temporarily, expanded under President Biden\u2019s American Rescue Plan \u2013 is very similar.</p>\n<p>From a policy perspective, the shift from a first-order to a second-order approach to economic justice makes a good deal of sense. After all, the practical record of state intervention in labour and product markets has been distinctly uneven, so if politicians can achieve their social objectives without risking heavy-handed forms of government failure, that is bound to be appealing to many policy-makers. The decoupling of economic security from paid work may also be welcome on moral and ethical grounds, since the Fordist labour-market model of the mid-twentieth-century was premised on a male-breadwinner family structure and tended to reinforce gendered patterns of dependency within the household. Finally, we might welcome the fact that cash transfers expand citizens\u2019 autonomy and choice, whilst insisting that a Christian conception of moral agency will always entail much more than control over private consumption.</p>\n<h2>Contemporary Debates and Concluding Questions</h2>\n<p>A strong current of recent scholarship has argued, however, that the politics of compensation or redistribution is politically weak and is liable to face a growing legitimacy crisis.<a class=\"anchor\" id=\"content100note10anc\" name=\"content100note10anc\">\u00a0</a><a class=\"note\" href=\"#content100note10sym\">[\u00a010\u00a0]</a> The problem is threefold:</p>\n<p>Firstly, once economic rights are untethered from the concrete goods required for subsistence (or flourishing) and from people\u2019s daily experience of making a living, they are likely to seem increasingly abstract and arbitrary: a matter of political fiat rather than the expression of a deeper moral economy.</p>\n<p>Secondly, the pattern of production, prices, and rewards produced by the market is likely to appear increasingly normal and natural \u2013 at least to its beneficiaries \u2013 since citizens cannot easily see the ways in which market outcomes are shaped by government policies.</p>\n<p>Thirdly, the process of redistribution requires constant government activity: if at any point the transfer machine is turned off, the market is likely to produce quite extreme concentrations of wealth and economic power.</p>\n<p>The practical result is that liberal and social-democratic politicians have found themselves increasingly struggling to justify and explain patterns of redistribution, especially in periods of actual or perceived fiscal crisis. This can be seen not only in the contested politics of \u2018welfare\u2019 (where the current UK government has tightened conditionality rules and encouraged tabloid attacks on perceived \u2018scroungers\u2019) but also in debates over foreign aid spending. The UN target of spending 0.7% of gross national income on overseas development assistance appears arbitrary because it is arbitrary. On the other hand, it is not easy to see how a first-order vision of global economic justice might be operationalized as a basis for public policy in the UK and other affluent countries.</p>\n<p>This paper has moved some way beyond the focus of Prof. Wolterstorff\u2019s Theology Brief in an attempt to think about how the categories he uses might be applied to contemporary issues in economic and social policy. I conclude, then, by inviting readers to consider two questions:</p>\n<p>Firstly, is it meaningful and useful to apply the distinction between first- and second-order justice to the economic sphere in this way, or am I stretching the concept too far? (Perhaps I am.)</p>\n<p>Secondly, is there any <i>theological</i> reason for Christians to prefer policies which seek to achieve economic justice by acting directly on the real economy rather than by the \u2018second-order\u2019 means of redistributive transfers, or is this choice simply a matter of economic judgment and political strategy?</p>\n<h2 class=\"new_page\">Further reading</h2>\n<p>Peter Sloman, <i>Transfer State: The Idea of a Guaranteed Income and the Politics of Redistribution in Modern Britain </i>(Oxford, 2019), explores how attitudes to redistribution have changed in Britain over the last century and how these ideas have shaped policy responses to poverty and inequality.</p>\n<p>Malcolm Torry, <i>Citizen\u2019s Basic Income: A Christian Social Policy </i>(2016), develops a Christian case for a Universal Basic Income.</p>\n<p>Tim Rogan, <i>The Moral Economists: R.H.

    "bodyText": "I take it as axiomatic that the God who made the profusion of creation is also the God of the profusion we find in human language and voice. Genesis 1 bears witness to the unstinting abundance that God created, and John 1 places the Word at the heart of that creation. In language, a surfeit of variety meets us everywhere. We hear a profusion of voices in society. We are immersed in languages, dialects, varieties, genres, accents, jargons, styles. They eddy and swirl round us in an always-changing current of linguistic reproduction and creation.\n\nLanguage is also a social fact, implicated in the shape of society. It is an identity bearer, a means of self-expression. Our voice in particular is always embodied, personal, situated. Language is wholly interactive (in accord with Wolterstorff\u2019s stress on the centrality of interaction), a bridge between self and other, central to communication. As well as a truth teller, language can also be a deceiver. Social inequities produce linguistic inequities, and language reproduces injustice in many areas of society: structures, demographics, power, gender, ethnicity, globalization. Not all the voices of society are easily or equally heard.\n\nThe founding sociolinguist Dell Hymes had a concern for justice and how that is evidenced and substantiated in the voices of society \u2013 who speaks, who is listened to, who is valued, who is disregarded. \u2018One way to think of the society in which one would like to live is to think of the kinds of voices it would have\u2019, he wrote (1996: 64). In such a sociolinguistics of voice, linguistic justice is something that is not a given but needs to be accomplished. It invites and requires engagement in society, including intellectual engagement. It is a continuation of the Old Testament tradition where the prophetic voice was central to guiding and correcting Israel in the ways of justice.\n\nLinguistic justice begins with a most basic question: What is a language? It turns out this is not a simple or objective matter.\n\nThere are languages in the world that have different names but are linguistically very similar \u2013 Hindi/Urdu, Serbian/Croatian. They are kept apart by political rather than linguistic boundaries. There are other clusters of linguistic codes which are so diverse that some are not mutually intelligible, but they bear a single name such as Arabic or Chinese. They are held together by political rather than linguistic factors. \u2018A language is a dialect with an army and navy\u2019, is an axiom credited to the early 20 th century Yiddish linguist Max Weinreich. It is social and political rather than linguistic factors that give a language its status.\n\nThe notion of identifiable languages (and often, their identification with a nation) is in fact an 18 th century Enlightenment construct, but one that was imposed on the rest of the world through European colonizers. These \u2013 including Christian missionaries - enthusiastically distinguished, defined and named \u2018languages\u2019 wherever they went. In west Africa in the late 19 th century, for example, French military expeditions traversed what was to become Senegal, mapping the boundaries of groups and their languages (Irvine & Gal 2000). The languages and their speakers were interpreted as having essential characteristics, including different levels of intelligence. The groups were assumed to be monolingual, but clean boundaries between them could only be mapped by ignoring the prevailing multilingualism. The imperial payoff for such idealizations was that territories and their peoples were identified, segmented and ready for governance.\n\nWolterstorff has referred to the ways in which elitist and colonialist practices promote injustice. In language, the fruits of inequitable colonial, postcolonial and quasi-colonial ideologies are still manifest in today\u2019s world. Sociolinguistic studies have examined the requirement for contestants to speak fluent English not Swahili to win a national beauty contest in Tanzania (Billings 2009); the oppression of the Oroqen language of northeastern China under colonization by the Han Chinese and their language, Mandarin (Li Fengxiang 2005); and the triumph of Bahasa Indonesia as the national language of Indonesia at the expense of many local languages (Errington 1998). In these and many other situations, groups of speakers find their voices stifled by unconscious attitudes or intentional policies.\n\nIdeologies of language value one linguistic form or code as better or worse than another, promoting some people\u2019s voices and muzzling others\u2019.\n\nA language, dialect or feature may be taken as representative of a group of people. Although the association with the group is arbitrary, iconization treats the feature as somehow having a natural and inherent link with the group. This is a very ancient scenario, shown by the story of shibboleth in Judges chapter 12. After defeating the tribe of Ephraim in battle, the Gileadites waited for the fleeing Ephraimites at the River Jordan:\n\nWhenever one of the fugitives of Ephraim said, \u2018Let me go over\u2019, the men of Gilead would say to him, \u2018Are you an Ephraimite?\u2019 When he said, \u2018No\u2019, they said to him, \u2018Then say Shibboleth\u2019, and he said, \u2018Sibboleth\u2019, for he could not pronounce it right. Then they seized him and killed him at the fords of the Jordan. (NRSV)\n\nThe word shibboleth has been carried into English to mean precisely a language feature which is identified with a group.\n\nIf what you speak is not recognized as a language, your voice may be denigrated or ignored, you will likely be subject to linguistic injustice. Hungarian speakers in Romania, for example, believe their speech is inferior to that spoken in Hungary. In countless countries, minority-group children have been punished for speaking their home language at school. These evaluations represent the belief that one linguistic form or code is better or worse than another. It sounds more beautiful or more ugly, is superior or inferior, is more or less moral. This forms the basis for linguistic injustice. We place people socially by the way they talk. As George Bernard Shaw wrote in the preface to his play Pygmalion , words later paraphrased into one of the songs of My Fair Lady:\n\nAn Englishman\u2019s way of speaking absolutely classifies him, The moment he talks he makes some other Englishman despise him.\n\nIn the United States, mental mapping studies of dialect regions show that the dialects which are the most salient to Americans are precisely the ones that they despise \u2013 those of New York City and the South. Denigration of other people\u2019s accents is widespread, and its saddest outcome is how often it is reflected in speakers also downgrading their own accent.\n\nJesus was also probably subject to linguistic denigration. We know that Galilee was regarded as a cultural backwater by the Jerusalem elite \u2013 reflected in Nathaniel\u2019s rhetorical question, \u2018Can anything good come out of Nazareth?\u2019 (John 1: 46). From the Gospels, we also know how distinctive was the Galilean accent (presumably of Aramaic), because it gave Peter away as he hovered on the edges of Jesus\u2019 trial (Matthew 26: 73). We can assume that Jesus had a similar accent to Peter\u2019s, so the Jerusalem rulers\u2019 hostility was probably not just to what Jesus said but to how he said it. His voice was \u2018despised and rejected\u2019.\n\nThe Russian thinker Mikhail Bakhtin, an unorthodox Orthodox Christian of the early 20 th century, maintained that language is a site of struggle between the dynamic centrifugal forces which whirl it apart into diversity, and the hegemonic centripetal forces which strive to standardize and prescribe the way language should be. He celebrates the centrifugal - the divergence, individuality, creativity, even the chaos of language variety.\n\nLanguage standardization through the education system is a primary site of linguistic injustice. Even the world\u2019s best-known standard accent - British Received Pronunciation (\u2018the Queen\u2019s English/BBC English\u2019) - is a relatively recent invention: before the mid-18 th century there was no sense of a standard pronunciation for English. Still nowadays only a small minority of the British population can speak this standard. French is arguably the world\u2019s most standardized language, since the founding of the Acad\u00e9mie Fran\u00e7aise in the 17 th century. As the sociologist Pierre Bourdieu has theorized, using the standard gives its speaker linguistic capital . Even French encompasses a large range of variety that is ignored in defining what the standard is, to the point of excluding the idea that variety even exists.\n\nIf speaking the standard is a social advantage, then lacking it will be a disadvantage. The unavoidable outcome of language standardization is inequity, certainly for some, often for the many. The routine companion of linguistic disadvantage is economic and social disadvantage, whether that be for Moroccans in France, northerners in England, Quechua speakers in Peru, or African Americans. If the \u2018best people\u2019 speak in a certain way, you will not become one of the best people without their speech. In his preface to the manual Rhyming Roadways to Good Speech (1940), Professor F. Sinclaire of Canterbury University College, New Zealand, wrote:\n\nDebased speech \u2013 it cannot too strongly be insisted \u2013 is a symptom of general cultural debasement, of growing insensibility to values which lie at the very roots of all culture. Someone has said that people who talk through the nose will think through the nose. It is certain that if we speak badly we shall think badly and feel coarsely.\n\nQuoted in Gordon & Abell (1990: 30)\n\nHowever, local and subcultural groups create and maintain countervailing linguistic norms which are defiantly oppositional to the standard. The vernacular \u2013 rather, \u2018vernaculars\u2019, always pluralized - is immensely more variegated than the standard, and is the usual locus of linguistic innovation and creativity. Shared local networks and practices serve as vernacular maintenance mechanisms with their own powers of persuasion and conformity in the face of institutional propagation of the standard. Most people accept the standard as natural, normal, commonsense, eliding the often conflictual socioeconomic and sociolinguistic realities. But on the basis of speech, people \u2013 including academics - have been prepared to make large social and personal judgments.\n\nThe stabilizing, centralizing impetus of linguistic standard and convention is in tension with the decentralizing, momentary, creative use of language. The centrifugal forces are always spinning new words, new dialects, new languages, new voices, regardless of all efforts to the contrary by academies, educators, politicians or pedants. However, the belief that monolingualism is natural and that multilingualism is a curse is deeply embedded in western consciousness, and it is the Bible that has provided the leading image and narrative of this in the cultural memory of the West.\n\nThe story in Genesis 11 is usually interpreted as a condemnation of language diversity, and is still enormously influential and productive. But there is an alternative reading available for the narrative: that the judgment of Babel promoted the spread of humankind and the rich diversification of its languages. The fault of Babel was not pride but a refusal to disperse and \u2018fill the earth\u2019 as mandated at creation and after the flood. In Bell (2011) I argue that Babel is a blessing rather than a curse, adopting the interpretation proposed by Walter Brueggemann (1982). Babel is in this reading a charter for linguistic variety, a manifesto for multilingualism rather than a lament for lost monolingualism.\n\nThere is a close link between this view of Babel and Bakhtin\u2019s centrifugal forces in language change. Babel is in part a story about linguistic power, about the social and political meanings of monolingualism and multilingualism. As indicated earlier, the European nation-state was created with the assumption that a nation should have its own single language. Such monolingualism is routinely coercive against other languages. Babel stands as a monument to the ultimate futility of the drive to enforce monolingualism.\n\nThe day of Pentecost has often been described as the reversal of Babel, but close comparison shows this is not the case. Pentecost involves not so much the reversal of Babel as its redemption. Reversing Babel would mean that speakers returned to speaking a single language or hearers returned to hearing a single language. But that is not what happened. At Pentecost speakers talked and listeners heard in a great variety of languages (not in fact in ecstatic tongues) - Acts 2 indicates no fewer than thirteen. The languages remained different but they were understood. Peter then stood up and preached to the crowd, however, presumably in a single language, and communicated well enough for them to be \u2018cut to the heart\u2019. The multiplicity of languages at Pentecost were not given primarily as a matter of communication, then, but of identity . Acts 2 characterizes the languages three times as the listeners\u2019 mother tongues - the languages they grew up in, the languages they were born in, the languages they were at home in. The coming of the Spirit was marked by an affirmation of their identities and of the diverse languages and cultures in which these \u2018devout Jews from every nation under heaven\u2019 were at home.\n\nThere is, however, one sense in which the effect of Babel was reversed at Pentecost if not the phenomenon itself. Peter\u2019s sermon was preached in a lingua franca, an imperial language \u2013 probably Greek, possibly Aramaic. The spread and inheritance of languages of empire meant that diverse and scattered audiences were all able to understand a single tongue. This gave Jesus his probable mother tongue (Aramaic), and the universality of Greek enabled the wide preaching of the early church and the spread and preservation of the New Testament writings. What happened at Pentecost was in some way the best of both worlds linguistically, affirming both identity through community languages and communication through a shared lingua franca.\n\nI would suggest that, with Hymes and Bakhtin, we seek not only amelioration of people\u2019s linguistic conditions but address the foundations of linguistic discrimination and inequity. Linguistic justice promotes the speaking and hearing of marginalized and stifled voices. Such commitments were often the prime drivers that motivated the founders of the field of sociolinguistics, and they have continued to spur my own and successive generations of sociolinguistic scholars \u2013 many of them Christians.\n\nIt is the role of such a sociolinguistics to \u2018give voice\u2019. This includes giving voice to ourselves, but saliently it also stresses the need to enable the voices of others. To accept someone\u2019s voice is to accept them; to reject someone\u2019s voice, rejects them. If we can give voice, we can also take voice away. We can disable the voices of others through not listening to them or by drowning them out. Or we can \u2018give ear\u2019 to what the socially marginalized are saying. I know that my country has a particular responsibility to M\u0101ori and Pasifika voices, and other nations have their own parallel situations. For this we need a politics of voice, which celebrates the profusion of voices, and which is committed to a just hearing for all those. Such staunch and adept listenership is one hallmark of a just and Christian approach to language in society: \u2018Those who have ears to hear, let them hear\u2019.\n\nBakhtin, M. M. 1986.

    "bodyHtml": "<p>I take it as axiomatic that the God who made the profusion of creation is also the God of the profusion we find in human language and voice. Genesis 1 bears witness to the unstinting abundance that God created, and John 1 places the Word at the heart of that creation. In language, a surfeit of variety meets us everywhere. We hear a profusion of voices in society. We are immersed in languages, dialects, varieties, genres, accents, jargons, styles. They eddy and swirl round us in an always-changing current of linguistic reproduction and creation.</p>\n<p>Language is also a social fact, implicated in the shape of society. It is an identity bearer, a means of self-expression. Our voice in particular is always embodied, personal, situated. Language is wholly interactive (in accord with Wolterstorff\u2019s stress on the centrality of interaction), a bridge between self and other, central to communication. As well as a truth teller, language can also be a deceiver. Social inequities produce linguistic inequities, and language reproduces injustice in many areas of society: structures, demographics, power, gender, ethnicity, globalization. Not all the voices of society are easily or equally heard.</p>\n<p>The founding sociolinguist Dell Hymes had a concern for justice and how that is evidenced and substantiated in the voices of society \u2013 who speaks, who is listened to, who is valued, who is disregarded. \u2018One way to think of the society in which one would like to live is to think of the kinds of voices it would have\u2019, he wrote (1996: 64). In such a sociolinguistics of voice, linguistic justice is something that is not a given but needs to be accomplished. It invites and requires engagement in society, including intellectual engagement. It is a continuation of the Old Testament tradition where the prophetic voice was central to guiding and correcting Israel in the ways of justice.</p>\n<h2>What is a language?</h2>\n<p>Linguistic justice begins with a most basic question: What is a language? It turns out this is not a simple or objective matter.</p>\n<h3>Languages as sociopolitical</h3>\n<p>There are languages in the world that have different names but are linguistically very similar \u2013 Hindi/Urdu, Serbian/Croatian. They are kept apart by political rather than linguistic boundaries. There are other clusters of linguistic codes which are so diverse that some are not mutually intelligible, but they bear a single name such as Arabic or Chinese. They are held together by political rather than linguistic factors. \u2018A language is a dialect with an army and navy\u2019, is an axiom credited to the early 20<sup>th</sup> century Yiddish linguist Max Weinreich. It is social and political rather than linguistic factors that give a language its status.</p>\n<h3>From the Enlightenment to colonization</h3>\n<p>The notion of identifiable languages (and often, their identification with a nation) is in fact an 18<sup>th</sup> century Enlightenment construct, but one that was imposed on the rest of the world through European colonizers. These \u2013 including Christian missionaries - enthusiastically distinguished, defined and named \u2018languages\u2019 wherever they went. In west Africa in the late 19<sup>th</sup> century, for example, French military expeditions traversed what was to become Senegal, mapping the boundaries of groups and their languages (Irvine &amp; Gal 2000). The languages and their speakers were interpreted as having essential characteristics, including different levels of intelligence. The groups were assumed to be monolingual, but clean boundaries between them could only be mapped by ignoring the prevailing multilingualism. The imperial payoff for such idealizations was that territories and their peoples were identified, segmented and ready for governance.</p>\n<p>Wolterstorff has referred to the ways in which elitist and colonialist practices promote injustice. In language, the fruits of inequitable colonial, postcolonial and quasi-colonial ideologies are still manifest in today\u2019s world. Sociolinguistic studies have examined the requirement for contestants to speak fluent English not Swahili to win a national beauty contest in Tanzania (Billings 2009); the oppression of the Oroqen language of northeastern China under colonization by the Han Chinese and their language, Mandarin (Li Fengxiang 2005); and the triumph of Bahasa Indonesia as the national language of Indonesia at the expense of many local languages (Errington 1998). In these and many other situations, groups of speakers find their voices stifled by unconscious attitudes or intentional policies.</p>\n<h2>Language ideologies and injustice</h2>\n<p>Ideologies of language value one linguistic form or code as better or worse than another, promoting some people\u2019s voices and muzzling others\u2019.</p>\n<h3>Iconization</h3>\n<p>A language, dialect or feature may be taken as representative of a group of people. Although the association with the group is arbitrary, iconization treats the feature as somehow having a natural and inherent link with the group. This is a very ancient scenario, shown by the story of <em>shibboleth</em> in Judges chapter 12. After defeating the tribe of Ephraim in battle, the Gileadites waited for the fleeing Ephraimites at the River Jordan:</p>\n<blockquote><p>Whenever one of the fugitives of Ephraim said, \u2018Let me go over\u2019, the men of Gilead would say to him, \u2018Are you an Ephraimite?\u2019 When he said, \u2018No\u2019, they said to him, \u2018Then say Shibboleth\u2019, and he said, \u2018Sibboleth\u2019, for he could not pronounce it right. Then they seized him and killed him at the fords of the Jordan. (NRSV)</p></blockquote>\n<p>Whenever one of the fugitives of Ephraim said, \u2018Let me go over\u2019, the men of Gilead would say to him, \u2018Are you an Ephraimite?\u2019 When he said, \u2018No\u2019, they said to him, \u2018Then say Shibboleth\u2019, and he said, \u2018Sibboleth\u2019, for he could not pronounce it right. Then they seized him and killed him at the fords of the Jordan. (NRSV)</p>\n<p>The word <em>shibboleth </em>has been<em> </em>carried into English to mean precisely a language feature which is identified with a group.</p>\n<h3>Erasure</h3>\n<p>If what you speak is not recognized as a language, your voice may be denigrated or ignored, you will likely be subject to linguistic injustice. Hungarian speakers in Romania, for example, believe their speech is inferior to that spoken in Hungary. In countless countries, minority-group children have been punished for speaking their home language at school. These evaluations represent the belief that one linguistic form or code is better or worse than another. It sounds more beautiful or more ugly, is superior or inferior, is more or less moral. This forms the basis for linguistic injustice. We place people socially by the way they talk. As George Bernard Shaw wrote in the preface to his play <em>Pygmalion</em>, words later paraphrased into one of the songs of <em>My Fair Lady:</em></p>\n<blockquote><p>An Englishman\u2019s way of speaking absolutely classifies him, The moment he talks he makes some other Englishman despise him.</p></blockquote>\n<p>An Englishman\u2019s way of speaking absolutely classifies him, The moment he talks he makes some other Englishman despise him.</p>\n<p>In the United States, mental mapping studies of dialect regions show that the dialects which are the most salient to Americans are precisely the ones that they despise \u2013 those of New York City and the South. Denigration of other people\u2019s accents is widespread, and its saddest outcome is how often it is reflected in speakers also downgrading their own accent.</p>\n<h3>Jesus and Linguistic Discrimination</h3>\n<p>Jesus was also probably subject to linguistic denigration. We know that Galilee was regarded as a cultural backwater by the Jerusalem elite \u2013 reflected in Nathaniel\u2019s rhetorical question, \u2018Can anything good come out of Nazareth?\u2019 (John 1: 46). From the Gospels, we also know how distinctive was the Galilean accent (presumably of Aramaic), because it gave Peter away as he hovered on the edges of Jesus\u2019 trial (Matthew 26: 73). We can assume that Jesus had a similar accent to Peter\u2019s, so the Jerusalem rulers\u2019 hostility was probably not just to what Jesus said but to how he said it. His voice was \u2018despised and rejected\u2019.</p>\n<h2>Language as a site of struggle</h2>\n<p>The Russian thinker Mikhail Bakhtin, an unorthodox Orthodox Christian of the early 20<sup>th</sup> century, maintained that language is a site of struggle between the dynamic centrifugal forces which whirl it apart into diversity, and the hegemonic centripetal forces which strive to standardize and prescribe the way language should be. He celebrates the centrifugal - the divergence, individuality, creativity, even the chaos of language variety.</p>\n<h3>Standard languages</h3>\n<p>Language standardization through the education system is a primary site of linguistic injustice. Even the world\u2019s best-known standard accent - British Received Pronunciation (\u2018the Queen\u2019s English/BBC English\u2019) - is a relatively recent invention: before the mid-18<sup>th</sup> century there was no sense of a standard pronunciation for English. Still nowadays only a small minority of the British population can speak this standard. French is arguably the world\u2019s most standardized language, since the founding of the Acad\u00e9mie Fran\u00e7aise in the 17<sup>th</sup> century. As the sociologist Pierre Bourdieu has theorized, using the standard gives its speaker linguistic capital .

The unavoidable outcome of language standardization is inequity, certainly for some, often for the many. The routine companion of linguistic disadvantage is economic and social disadvantage, whether that be for Moroccans in France, northerners in England, Quechua speakers in Peru, or African Americans. If the \u2018best people\u2019 speak in a certain way, you will not become one of the best people without their speech. In his preface to the manual <em>Rhyming Roadways to Good Speech</em> (1940), Professor F. Sinclaire of Canterbury University College, New Zealand, wrote:</p>\n<blockquote><p>Debased speech \u2013 it cannot too strongly be insisted \u2013 is a symptom of general cultural debasement, of growing insensibility to values which lie at the very roots of all culture.

These are strong themes that should guide Christian academics to excel and be relevant wherever they find themselves.\n\nThere are however questions that need to be addressed in our discussion of justice. What is the source and nature of justice from a Christian perspective? Are there no distinctly Christian approaches to justice and rights? How does my interest in justice differ from that of an atheist, a Buddhist or a Muslim? What is in my Christian faith that should motivate me to be interested in justice in my institution? Why should I be interested in the questions of justice that arise in my teaching and research? Is our interest in justice aimed at building a good and moral society? After that, what? Is the gospel message only about building a fair and moral society? Will any fair and moral society in the world be considered Christian? What is the overall purpose of this discussion anyway? Is there no salvific or missional purpose to the Christian interest in justice?\n\nProfessor Wolterstorff states that biblical writers do not explain what justice is and that they do not offer a \u201ctheory\u201d of justice. Therefore, he suggests that \u201cFor an explanation of what justice is, a theory, we have to turn to philosophers.\u201d I agree that there is a rich corpus of resources on justice in philosophic history which we can draw from, but should this be our guide? Is it true that the Bible does not give us a guide to a theory of justice?\n\nLet us return to Matthew 22: 37-40 for better insight: \u201cJesus said unto him, Thou shalt love the Lord thy God with all thy heart, and with all thy soul, and with all thy mind. This is the first and great commandment. And the second is like unto it, Thou shalt love thy neighbour as thyself. On these two commandments hang all the law and the prophets.\u201d What did Jesus mean when he said, \u201cOn these two commandments hang all the law and the prophets?\u201d I think that what he was really saying is that \u201cOn these two commandments hang the entire scope of justice.\u201d He was actually laying the foundations of a Justice theory and demonstrated it through his life. The true origin of Justice is in the nature of God. What Jesus did was to situate justice in the womb of love. He didn\u2019t philosophize about it; he lived it. It was left for Paul to lay down a full-blown theory of love in 1 Corinthians 13: \u201cLove is patient,\u00a0love is kind. It does not envy, it does not boast, it is not proud.\u00a0It does not dishonor others, it is not self-seeking,\u00a0it is not easily angered,it keeps no record of wrongs.\u00a0Love does not delight in evil\u00a0but rejoices with the truth.\u00a0It always protects, always trusts, always hopes, always perseveres.\u201d\n\nThe motivation of the Christian scholar to stand for justice should therefore rest on just one principle, Love \u2013 the love of God, love of man, love of Academia, love of students and colleagues, love of our institution, etc. It is this commitment to love that can motivate Christian academics to take action when confronted with injustice in society. Any concept of justice that is not rooted in love will end up finding its roots in law or the constitution, and the legal system is subject to periodic changes and amendments. When Jesus requires us to be just, is he simply asking us to obey the constitution? There is a huge gap between Love-based justice and law-based justice.\n\nIn my experience as a Christian scholar, I have observed some of my colleagues display a commendable sense of justice. But in some cases, the Christian sense of justice ends up in a strict adherence to rules even when they are no longer reasonable. Therefore, the Christian witness, through the adherence to rule-based justice, sometimes becomes negative. The impression is given that Christians are rigid and not open to dialogue. I believe that if we practice true agape, we can teach the world the true meaning of justice. The problem however is that we have not given sufficient thought to the concept of love. And we ought to do so! In the modern day, eros is confused with Agape and the chief formulators of the concept of love are now in Hollywood.\n\nOnce again, I ask: what is the purpose of my interest in justice? If my interest in justice has no missional or salvific purpose, how far can I go? The whole point about Christianity is to redirect humanity back to the love of God. What is it about love that makes it redemptive? This is a question that Christian scholars should reflect on. From the life of Christ and the teachings of the Apostle, we can infer that love is sacrificial and selfless; it preserves the truth, the good and the beautiful; it draws people closer and promotes human solidarity. Therefore, it creates space for sincere engagement with the world, and increases the possibility of expanding the kingdom of God.\n\nAs individuals in our various institutions our primary focus ought to be the kingdom of God. Everything God did for mankind was motivated by love. Our interest in justice should also be motivated by love. Our interest in reconciling fallen humanity to God should motivate us not only to be just in our dealings with others (First Order) but to seek to transform our institutions with Christian values. Justice in this case, is therefore not an end but a means to an end. The end will be to demonstrate through our activities the love of God and give all men and women an opportunity to reconcile with God.\n\nIn my opinion, Justice without this salvific purpose is pointless. Furthermore, if we do not rest justice on love, we may surrender our commitment to a thoroughly Christian concept to secular philosophers or artists. Philosophers can only give us a limited perception of justice, and not a full picture. This is because justice is based on the nature of God, which is love. And this theory was there before Plato\u2019s theory of Justice.",

Is there no salvific or missional purpose to the Christian interest in justice?</p>\n<h2>Love \u2013 the missing link</h2>\n<p>In my opinion, the real challenge for Christian scholars today is not merely to be engaged in issues of justice in their universities, but to understand the compelling reasons for this engagement. We need to develop a robust theory of Justice that is biblical and relevant to our world today. The Theology Brief does not take this path because it rejects a very important perspective in the discussion, which is that in the New Testament, justice has been superseded by love and that Jesus did not issue a justice-command but a love- command. Of course, as Professor Wolterstorff puts it, \u201cacting justly is not incompatible with acting out of agapic love; it\u2019s an example of such love. Love and justice must be understood in such a way that love incorporates justice. This is a valid point, but it further highlights the point that love supersedes justice. There is no love without justice but there can be justice without love. You can give everyone their due even when you do not love them. You can do justice not out of conviction but out of the fear of the law and punishment. It is for that reason that Christian scholars must always have the Love commandment on their radar. If this is the case, if love must incorporate justice, then our discussion of justice should lead us to explore the concept of love. This is what I think may be missing in our Christian approaches to justice.</p>\n<h2>Jesus situates Justice on Love</h2>\n<p>Professor Wolterstorff states that biblical writers do not explain what justice is and that they do not offer a \u201ctheory\u201d of justice.

And the second is like unto it, Thou shalt love thy neighbour as thyself.

The Brief has provoked me to reflect on two aspects of academia which have been areas of struggle and frustration for me. They both involve the academia from a global perspective and the relationship between justice and the production of knowledge and involve first order justice. One is that of publishing in academia and the barriers encountered by academics in academic publishing. The other is that of determining the role of an academic.

It is near impossible for an academic in the global south (however understood) to publish in leading journals in her discipline, except as a matter of exception. Those exceptions are often personal to the academic, it is rarely a matter of institutional support. The exceptional circumstances almost always include supportive colleagues located elsewhere in the academy, often in well supported universities in the global north. These allies play a supportive role by way of offering invaluable feedback on draft work and extending invitations to academic events where one could get useful feedback on work in progress. It also includes the sharing of material that the academic in the global south is unable to access. Equally and perhaps more importantly, such allies support and encourage academics in the global south at a personal and emotional level too.\n\nDue to the issues surrounding academic publication, the production of knowledge is incomplete in many fields and the development of theory is inadequate. To frame it in a provocative way \u2013 the production of knowledge is captured by elite actors, speaking to a limited audience that has access to that knowledge. Access has to be understood not only in terms of accessing expensive data bases or subscriptions but also access in terms of the relatability of the knowledge that is being produced. To give you a simple example, Wolterstoff references several books in this Brief. I cannot afford to buy those books (my monthly income is approximately 2000 USD and we are now a single income family). Even if I could, I would have to wait indefinitely to receive the books. Or, I have to rely on the good will of colleagues overseas to share pdf versions of specific chapters or the whole book. This is the daily reality of an academic in the global south. Is this just? What obligations to academics in other contexts have, to address this situation? What is the responsibility of individual institutions and networks? Do they have any responsibilities beyond what they have already accepted in terms of scholarship schemes etc?\n\nThe academic is required to engage in the pursuit of truth through the production and dissemination of knowledge. Activism, if and when an academic engages in it, is deemed optional and a matter of secondary value. I find this demarcation of the role of an academic to be meaningful and useful as a matter of principle. However, again, as a scholar in the global south, I find it unhelpful in navigating the daily challenges I face. Almost on a daily basis, I face a choice between lending my knowledge and other skills to a matter of political and social significance, which requires support on the one hand, and academic work (more traditionally understood) on the other (for a recent example of my contribution, see here ). When I do choose to devote my time to academic work at the expense of responding to the call of activism, I feel guilty and irresponsible. In a context where resources are severely limited, ethical commitments to activism are limited among the elite, saying \u2018no\u2019 to activism can mean sometimes that no one else will actually make the intervention that you may have made. Even when you do choose to intervene, sometimes you do so at personal risk. All of this consumes intellectual, emotional and physical energy too.\n\nOthers before me have written about these challenges. I do think that these debates must continue to remain alive and be recognized for what they are. They are issues of epistemological justice. These are issues of first order justice. There are examples of how individuals, institutions and systems have sought to address these injustices. I, for instance, have benefitted from the Fulbright scholarship program, a tuition waiver from Harvard University and an Australia Awards Fellowship. At the Melbourne Law School, where I was a postdoctoral fellow, I thrived in an intellectual environment in which I was supported to reach the highest levels of academic publishing and I forged excellent collaborations which I now continue. These are experiences of how systems can work well to address the first order injustices that I highlight here.\n\nThe question I ask myself is, is this enough? What more ought to be done, particularly to address injustice in the development of theory and in meeting the dilemmas of having to chose between activism and academic work? Finally, in studying these issues from a global south perspective, what insights does this offer to the academia in the global north and then to academia from a global perspective?

Indeed, in my view, we can no longer think about the solution of any vexing problem of any magnitude entirely within the bounds of a single state. Invariably the actors (individuals, organizations, governments) which seek solutions to problems do so through the mechanisms of law.\n\nThese laws come in bewildering varieties, not only in their forms, but in the places they apply. Contrast laws promulgated by international organizations, such as UN treaties or the Inter-American Court of Human Rights, or laws produced by national institutions, such as India\u2019s Parliament or Brazil\u2019s administrative agencies, or state laws and municipal ordnances authorized by subnational or local bodies, such as Nigeria\u2019s state governments or the Jakarta city council.\n\nIncreasingly these laws are woven together into transnational legal orders (TLOs). These orders penetrate deeply into our national and local \u201cordinary affairs.\u201d Indeed, I propose that we cannot come to terms with the international order in the 21 st C without recognizing that much of the drama in international social, economic and even political orders is not only about state-to-state relations, the classic focus international relations scholarship and practice, but also about the rise and fall, cooperation and competition of TLOs. These orders shape increasingly more expansive zones of social behavior. We are all influenced by many of them, whether or not we are aware of their day-to-day influence in our lives.\n\nA transnational legal order (TLO) arises when individuals or industries or states or non-profit organizations or international organizations or any other kind of social actor seeks to solve problems that span national borders by legal means. These problems are as wide as the human condition:\n\nIf the issue is violence against women in civil conflicts , then a body of law has built up through international tribunals such as the International Criminal Tribunal for the Former Yugoslavia and the International Criminal Court that penetrates into state courts and reaches to warlords and other violators of international humanitarian law.\n\nIf the problem is how to save failing businesses , then there is a Legislative Guide on Insolvency produced by the UN Commission on International Trade Law (UNCITRAL) which is more or less reflected in the legislation of many countries in all regions.\n\nIf the issue is protecting the world from pandemics , then a complex of global, regional and national rules run from the World Health Organization to regional and national regulatory bodies to local hospitals.\n\nIn practice, a TLO can be the response to any social, economic or political issue that actors or norm entrepreneurs can successfully frame as a \u201cproblem\u201d to be solved in whole or in part by law.\n\nI have stated that a TLO rises or falls in response to problems of some sort or other. These problems, of course, are identified and framed in certain ways by actors who can include individuals, industry groups, religious organizations, politicians, civil servants, elected officials, crime control authorities, authoritarian rulers, international civil servants, international NGOs \u2013 the list is almost endless. These actors seek to diagnose a problem in a certain way, obtain support for that diagnosis, then implement a solution that will remedy the ill through law, through a TLO.\n\nA TLO has three elements. [\u00a01\u00a0]\n\nA TLO is transnational : that is, it seeks to bring orderly relationships sometimes across the borders of states such as the US or Mexico, China and South Korea, India and Pakistan; sometimes across entire regions, such as the African Union or the Latin American human rights order; sometimes across the world, such as the UN Commission on International Trade Law\u2019s Rotterdam Rules on carrying goods across oceans where much of world trade occurs.\n\nA TLO is legal. Here I adopt a sociolegal definition of law that is expansive. It includes so-called hard law , which is produced internationally in the form of treaties between states and which are binding on those states, or which is produced within states by Parliaments or executive agencies and which are enforced by domestic authorities. It also includes soft law, which now embraces a vast array of legal instruments, scripts and accountability devices, ranging from legislative guides and model laws to standards, guides, best practices, principles, codes of conduct and the like.\n\nA TLO is constructed to produce order . For a TLO to be fully established there will be a continuity or similarity or concordance of laws between transnational bodies, national legal institutions and local institutions. For example, the international standards of corporate bankruptcy law are recognizable in Australia\u2019s or South Korea\u2019s bankruptcy laws, and reach down to local courts in the provinces and towns of both countries. This order is intended to guide behavior in predictable ways that are observable in patterns of behavior.\n\nMy colleagues in international relations at the Australian National University, however, point out another critical reason for thinking about TLOs at this moment in contemporary history. [\u00a02\u00a0] They express the view that a liberal international order has been dominant in the world since a new architecture of institutions and laws emerged from the ashes of WWII. That architecture led to international institutions (the UN, World Bank, International Monetary Fund, World Health Organization, among hundreds of others) which created and propagated a kind of international rule of law with courts and tribunals to arbitrate amongst conflicting parties in international disputes, such as the rights that China, Vietnam, Philippines and other states have in the South China Sea. Both the architecture and institutions were led and dominated by the victors of WWII and their ways of thinking. The TLOs that have arisen at rapidly rising rates in the last fifty years are embedded within this liberal international order. Many TLOs are premised on the belief that there are universal rules, applicable to all, and binding morally and in law. Disputes are settled by negotiation or arbitration or conciliation or decisions by neutral tribunals. Those decisions should be binding and behavior by states or corporations or individuals should conform to them.\n\nAt present, there is something of a revolt against this international order. Most confrontationally it is led by China which chafes at standards and practices of the international community, for example, on rule of law or human rights, that lead to criticism and condemnation of its domestic behavior. Yet there is another line of critique that converges with the theological ethics proposed in the NWTB. There is some justice in the charge that the rules of the international order were ordered and over-determined by powerful western states in the international political economy \u2013 the US, European states, and later other rich countries allied with them, conventionally those 38 countries in the Organization for Economic Cooperation and Development (OECD). Justice principles should invigorate a re-appraisal of the existing order.\n\nIf TLOs are widespread, probably growing in number and in the pace of their formation, and if TLOs are consequential, stretching from global/regional/transnational IOs to national capitals to provinces, cities, towns and villages in all regions, then they should be the focus of theological ethics.\n\nNWTB opens up that prospect, beginning with the OT imperative to do \u201csocial (systemic) justice\u201d(p1). Where NWTB opens the door to social institutions within the state, we may widen the scale of social institutions to those beyond the state\u2014the international and the global.\n\nWhat is this field of institutions? It includes: international organizations of states (e.g., UN, EU, OECD, or Mercator, the South American trade bloc); international non-governmental organizations (INGOs); international industry and professional associations; International religious groups; interrnational bodies of indigenous or dominated peoples, e.g., World Uyghur Congress, International Campaign for Tibet; and international media, among others. The list is almost endless and it grows geometrically, given the vibrancy of international civil society and the inter-dependency of states in the 21 st century.\n\nNWTB\u2019s pairing of the Isaiah 61 and Luke 4 passages opens up the prospect that justice orientations to the institutions, actors, processes and products of TLOs must embrace not only individuals and classes of people within states, but extend to \u201cpoor\u201d peoples and first-nation tribes and weak states in the international economic and political orders; \u201ccaptives\u201d in political prisons in despotic regimes or refugee camps in Bangladesh or Gaza; \u201coppressed\u201d peoples, such as the Uyghurs in concentration camps in Xinjiang, China, or the billions suffering under repressive rulers; and the \u201cbroken-hearted\u201d refugees in Europe or South East Asia who are losing their families, languages, culture and customs.\n\nWe have seen that NWTB writes of first-order justice as \u201cjustice in how we treat others in our ordinary affairs\u201d (6). This justice may be systemic and reach to the institutions of education, finance and business, health and geopolitics, among others. In each of these institutions or social systems, says Wolterstorff, we are charged with giving others their due, affirming their excellences, acknowledging their rights, uplifting their dignity and worth (9). To a considerable extent, TLOs provide the legal skeleton and muscle of first-order justice. Pick any institution in modern societies\u2014the family, education, religion, leisure, the arts, science, business, travel, health, politics\u2014and it will become quickly apparent that there are transnational laws, echoed or crafted by national lawmakers, and integrated into local institutions. What happens in Lima, Peru, or Tacoma, Washington, or Nairobi, Kenya, or Suva, Fiji, is directly or indirectly being shaped by a TLO. If the shape of these first-order institutions are molded by TLOs, then TLOs themselves should be subject, NWTB implies, to the theological ethics of justice and rights.\n\nI have elsewhere argued that a justice orientation derived from the logics of Isa 61 and Luke 4 warrants particular attention to weak actors in TLOs. [\u00a03\u00a0] That attention is both a matter of pragmatics and ethics. With respect to pragmatics, it acknowledges what Wolterstorff calls \u201cexcellences,\u201d in this case of so-called weak states. With respect to ethics, it recognizes that dignity should be accorded to states and organizations at the margins of the international political economy, to transitional and developing economies, to frail states struggling to consolidate the most basic institutions of statehood, such as an economy or education or health system.\n\nTwo ethical standards of justice illustrate how common ground can be found for Christian ethics and sociological analysis. I apply both here to the process of creating laws for the world, as building blocks of TLOs, in international organizations.\n\nIn his writings on the \u201cglobal common good\u201d, Roman Catholic theologian, David Hollenbach, [\u00a04\u00a0] critiques \u201cglobal political institutions\u201d for excluding the voices of many of the world\u2019s peoples from the creation of rules that will influence their lives. He proposes four ways that I find useful to better understand the meaning of my own research on global lawmaking: (a) they need to be sitting at the lawmaking table; (b) they need to be able to \u201cvoice\u201d their views; (c) they need to be drawn into dialog where their views are discussed; and (d) they need to be casting votes and exercising influence when decisions are made.\n\nIf we take these four ways as Christian ethical ideals for the construction of a just TLO, then a social scientist can readily translate them into empirical research questions, such as:\n\nWhat actors (states, organizations) are aware of lawmaking efforts?\n\nWho is invited to participate?\n\nWho gets to set the lawmaking agenda?\n\nWho attends the lawmaking sessions?\n\nWho gets to participate in the informal dialogs that always characterize international negotiations?\n\nWho is heard?\n\nWho has impact, and how?\n\nIn all these ways the dignity of the weak, the voices of the marginal, the excellences of the supposedly peripheral can be addressed in two ways. They can be appraised \u2014do actual practices fall short of the Christian ideal of participation? They can also be corrected \u2014are international organizations changing their practices of lawmaking, of constructing and adapting TLOs in ways that accord with Wolterstorff\u2019s ideals of justice and rights as they are specified more empirically in global forums?\n\nIn response to his question, \u201cCan Globalization be Shaped?\u201d, theologian Miroslav Volf [\u00a05\u00a0] argues for freely exercising \u201cinitiative and creativity\u201d in defending the weakest across the world. Similar notes are struck by others\u2014Max Stackhouse in his call for nurture and release of our God-given abilities to pursue the universal common good, and Pope John Paul II for living out, in the global domain, \u201cthe creativity which is the distinguishing mark of the human person.\u201d\n\nThe transnational and global lawmaking that is an essential part of a TLO invariably requires creativity. Oddly, this is not much studied by social scientists. However, if theologians press social scientists to imagine how global lawmaking might be seen through a theological lens of creativity it opens up several vistas where views may be shared.\n\nFor instance, in my reflections on weak global actors in global lawmaking, the institutions conforming to ideals of a first-order justice might enhance creativity in several ways: (a) imagining new forums or the adaptations of current lawmaking forums to draw out the creativities of weak actors; (b) listening to the views of weak actors on which kinds of law (e.g., treaties, models laws, guidelines) are more likely to be accepted by their governments and society; (c) recognizing that weak actors, such as emerging economies, may have particular problems that require attention less relevant to advanced economies; and (d) acknowledging the special expertises of government leaders, lawmakers and law implementers, in what will or will not work in their special circumstances.\n\nFor me, Wolterstorff\u2019s term of \u201cexcellences\u201d creates a kind of mental shift. It affirms dignity and acknowledges the giftedness of God\u2019s grace given to delegates and delegations too often thought as deprived or unsophisticated or to be treated as law-takers and not law-makers. It demands a theologically-inspired re-orientation towards the architects and builders of TLOs.\n\nFirst, he points to the several levels of social behavior where justice and rights are salient. While he uses interactions between persons, dyads, as his idiomatic mainstay, he notes that the logic of his argument applies to all social institutions within a society. For those of us who work on international institutions and global politics and society, we would take a step farther and explore more thoughtfully what justice ethics and Christian conceptions of rights can be brought to bear on the international sphere.\n\nSecond, we should bolster our theological understanding of first-order justice by examining how those \u201cfirst-order institutions\u201d are permeated by TLOs beyond the state, by the state, within the state. For all laws within a TLO the NWTB calls upon us to bring a theological standard both at the highest levels of giving others \u201ctheir due\u201d and recognizing their rights and \u201cexcellences\u201d, and at more empirically observable levels of such theological ethics as the enhancement of decision-making participation and affirmations of diverse creativities.\n\nI conclude with two questions.\n\nHow can we expand this conversation between theologians and social scientists to help Christians and persons of faith to \u201cthink big\u201d, i.e., think beyond the personal or the local and relational to institutions and states? Even farther, in a world of global interdependence and global rivalry, how may we carry further our Christian theological ethics into international organizations, transnational and global orders?\n\nI may also ask a question of myself and all other scholars who work on international institutions. Does a theological ethics of justice and rights exert a special calling on Christian scholars of global governance? What does it ask of me as I study TLOs, global norms and who makes them, how they are made, what opportunities and creativities they open up for those whose voices are marginalized, and how effective they are in bringing justice to the poor, imprisoned, oppressed and heart-broken?\n\nSusan Block-Lieb and Terence C.

    "bodyHtml": "<p>The world confronts enormous problems that very often, perhaps always, require responses beyond the capacity of single national governments or states. Indeed, in my view, we can no longer think about the solution of any vexing problem of any magnitude entirely within the bounds of a single state. Invariably the actors (individuals, organizations, governments) which seek solutions to problems do so through the mechanisms of law.</p>\n<p>These laws come in bewildering varieties, not only in their forms, but in the places they apply. Contrast laws promulgated by international organizations, such as UN treaties or the Inter-American Court of Human Rights, or laws produced by national institutions, such as India\u2019s Parliament or Brazil\u2019s administrative agencies, or state laws and municipal ordnances authorized by subnational or local bodies, such as Nigeria\u2019s state governments or the Jakarta city council.</p>\n<p>Increasingly these laws are woven together into transnational legal orders (TLOs). These orders penetrate deeply into our national and local \u201cordinary affairs.\u201d Indeed, I propose that we cannot come to terms with the international order in the 21<sup>st</sup> C without recognizing that much of the drama in international social, economic and even political orders is not only about state-to-state relations, the classic focus international relations scholarship and practice, but also about the rise and fall, cooperation and competition of TLOs. These orders shape increasingly more expansive zones of social behavior. We are <i>all </i>influenced by many of them, whether or not we are aware of their day-to-day influence in our lives.</p>\n<p>I have been working on economic and human rights TLOs for a number of years. Nicholas Wolterstorff\u2019s Theology Brief on Justice and Rights (hereafter NWTB) has stimulated me to revisit this work with the fresh theological lens he offers. I seek to apply to TLOs his distinction between first-order justice, which characterizes the everyday and ordinary affairs of our lives, and second-order justice, which responds to violations of first-order justice. I shall offer three propositions about justice and TLOs, each of which raises several questions.</p>\n<h2>TLOs Deserve Theological Engagement</h2>\n<h3>1. Why TLOs?</h3>\n<p>A transnational legal order (TLO) arises when individuals or industries or states or non-profit organizations or international organizations or any other kind of social actor seeks to solve problems that span national borders by legal<i> </i>means.

For those of us who work on international institutions and global politics and society, we would take a step farther and explore more thoughtfully what justice ethics and Christian conceptions of rights can be brought to bear on the international sphere.</p>\n<p>Second, we should bolster our theological understanding of first-order justice by examining how those \u201cfirst-order institutions\u201d are permeated by TLOs beyond the state, by the state, within the state. For all laws within a TLO the NWTB calls upon us to bring a theological standard both at the highest levels of giving others \u201ctheir due\u201d and recognizing their rights and \u201cexcellences\u201d, and at more empirically observable levels of such theological ethics as the enhancement of decision-making participation and affirmations of diverse creativities.</p>\n<p>I conclude with two questions.</p>\n<p>How can we expand this conversation between theologians and social scientists to help Christians and persons of faith to \u201cthink big\u201d, i.e., think beyond the personal or the local and relational to institutions and states? Even farther, in a world of global interdependence and global rivalry, how may we carry further our Christian theological ethics into international organizations, transnational and global orders?</p>\n<p>I may also ask a question of myself and all other scholars who work on international institutions. Does a theological ethics of justice and rights exert a special calling on Christian scholars of global governance? What does it ask of me as I study TLOs, global norms and who makes them, how they are made, what opportunities and creativities they open up for those whose voices are marginalized, and how effective they are in bringing justice to the poor, imprisoned, oppressed and heart-broken?</p>\n<h2 class=\"new_page\">Further Reading</h2>\n<p>Susan Block-Lieb and Terence C.

    "bodyText": "Fundamental to Professor Wolterstorff\u2019s argument is the proposition that justice, properly and biblically understood, involves an interpersonal, normative state of affairs concerning how individuals and institutions interact with each other, rather than a personal virtue or character trait. Focussing on the Greek terms dikaios and dikaiosune\u0304 , he argues that these terms are rarely used in the New Testament to denote a personal character trait and almost always refer or allude to just or right action. [\u00a01\u00a0] This appears to distinguish his position from a virtue-based approach, which understands just conduct to be secondary to, and ultimately attributed to, an individual\u2019s personal virtue or character. [\u00a02\u00a0]\n\nIt is not entirely clear, however, how far Professor Wolterstorff wishes to distinguish his position from virtue-ethics approaches because in several places he refers to justice as a virtue and he adopts the definition of justice proposed by the Roman jurist Ulpian, which is nothing other than a definition of the virtue of justice. [\u00a03\u00a0] This is broadly consistent with the stance taken by Thomas Aquinas when he endorsed Isidore of Seville\u2019s definition of justice as the particular virtue that \u2018makes men capable of doing just actions\u2019. [\u00a04\u00a0] Wolterstorff appears to acknowledge that human beings will not act justly unless they themselves have the character and disposition to do so.\n\nAlso fundamental to Professor Wolterstorff\u2019s paper is the proposition that first order justice is distinct from and more fundamental than second order justice. In his longer study on the topic, Justice: Rights and Wrongs , Wolterstorff critiques the argument advanced by Professor Oliver O\u2019Donovan that the biblical texts place more emphasis on \u2018judgment\u2019 \u2013 and especially \u2018just judgment\u2019 \u2013 than they do on \u2018justice\u2019 conceived abstractly and generally. [\u00a05\u00a0] According to Wolterstorff, O\u2019Donovan mistakenly considers that the key Hebrew word mishpat , which appears hundreds of times in the Old Testament, is properly to be understood as referring to the act of \u2018judgment\u2019, rather than the more abstract state of affairs that we call \u2018justice\u2019. This a controversy that I will take up further below.\n\nA third distinctive of Professor Wolterstorff\u2019s argument is that the essence of justice is to accord others their rights . He acknowledges that this emphasis on rights might be confused with a \u2018possessive individualism\u2019 which is based, not on the Bible or on the Christian tradition, but on the secular philosophies of the Enlightenment. However, he argues that the idea of natural rights has a much older and more Christian and biblical provenance. In his book, Justice: Rights and Wrongs , he again takes issue with O\u2019Donovan on this question of the origin of rights, adopting an important study by Professor Brian Tierney which showed that church lawyers of the twelfth century were already using the Latin term ius in a way that designated the particular subjective rights to which individuals were legally entitled and not only to refer to an objectively just state of affairs. [\u00a06\u00a0] More recently, however, Professor John Milbank has entered this controversy, arguing that this misses the point. The argument that was advanced by specialist scholars such as Michel Villey was not that there was no concept of subjective right (in the sense that an individual could have a particular ius in respect of some specific thing) but that the right was not subjectively grounded in the will and desire of the isolated individual. [\u00a07\u00a0]\n\nThis is not merely a theoretical argument. [\u00a08\u00a0] These differences of opinion have practical implications. Professor Wolterstorff draws attention to the importance of rights-arguments for the advancement of many of the great social justice movements of the twentieth century. While these arguments were framed in the language of rights, he points out they were directed at various forms of systemic injustice. The American Civil Rights Act of 1964, for example, prohibited discrimination on the basis of race, colour, religion, or national origin in the provision of goods and services in any place of public accommodation, such as hotels, restaurants and theatres. Similarly, the International Convention on the Elimination of All Forms of Racial Discrimination , adopted by the General Assembly of the United Nations in 1965, required signatory states to take measures to eliminate all forms of discrimination on the basis of race, colour, descent, or national or ethnic origin if that discrimination has the purpose or effect of nullifying or impairing the recognition, enjoyment or exercise, on an equal footing, of human rights and fundamental freedoms in the political, economic, social, cultural or any other field of public life.\n\nSince the 1960s, the scope of anti-discrimination laws has expanded tremendously. There are now very long lists of protected attributes in most jurisdictions and the areas in which discrimination is unlawful have multiplied so that even many private associations and religious organisations are subject to anti-discrimination requirements. This raises significant concerns for such organisations because maintenance of their distinctive religious or other identity depends on their ability to adopt particular standards of membership or to employ staff who share their religious convictions. In most anti-discrimination laws, the rights of religious groups to maintain their unique character are protected by special carve-outs that run against the grain of such laws. Over time, however, the exceptions that protect religious freedom have contracted, as the underlying premises of anti-discrimination laws have been pressed to their logical conclusions.\n\nWhy has this happened? As Professor Milbank has argued, rights have come to be understood as essentially individual and subjective in nature, not only in their legal expression, but also in their philosophical and theological foundations. [\u00a09\u00a0] On this view, the individual right not to be discriminated against is considered more basic and fundamental than the right of a religious group or organisation to maintain its distinctive character. Accordingly, when there is a conflict between such rights, the individual right must prevail over the collective right. This is applied even to the right to religious freedom itself, which is increasingly confined to the personal and the private, while its corporate and public dimensions are progressively restricted. There is a lot at stake, therefore, in these debates about the origin and nature of human rights. [\u00a010\u00a0]\n\nLiberal social ontologies tend to understand all social formations and cultural groups\u2014including the state itself\u2014as compositions of individuals. [\u00a011\u00a0] On this view, only individuals are ontologically real and have normative weight. Social groups exist to meet the needs and wants of individuals. They come into being when individuals deliberately create them or when they are recognised by some positive act of the state. This means that families, religious communities and cultural groups tend to be seen as special kinds of voluntary association, like any other voluntary relationship established within the free market. They have weight in moral, political and legal deliberation only to the extent that individuals or the state positively attribute significance to them. As a consequence, in any contest between the rights of an individual and the rights of a social group, the rights of the individual must have normative priority. If a group right is, in some particular circumstance, to prevail, it can only be because the group is a vehicle of the rights of the individuals that compose the group, and the collective sum of these individual rights outweighs the right of the disaffected individual. This is because the rights of individuals are regarded as more natural, basic and fundamental than group rights. In this way, as Benjamin Berger has put it, the \u2018[l]aw shapes religion in its own ideological image and likeness and conceptually confines it to the individual, choice-centred, and private dimensions of human life\u2019. [\u00a012\u00a0]\n\nWithin Roman Catholic social thought, the term subsidiarity has come to refer to a principle which resists the stark duality of individual and state that is characteristic of liberal political philosophy. [\u00a013\u00a0] According to Pope John Paul II, the principle of subsidiarity recognises that:\n\nSuch an approach is often called personalism , because it seeks to affirm two important truths about humanity: firstly, the dignity of each individual person and, secondly, the embedding of each individual within a matrix of associations and communities. Human beings have inherent dignity, but this dignity does not isolate the individual from his or her social context and does not fixate, as Immanuel Kant did, on the autonomous will of the individual as the loadstar of ethical reasoning. [\u00a015\u00a0]\n\nWithin Reformed Christian thought, a similar perspective is advanced under the name of sphere sovereignty . As Professor Wolterstorff has elsewhere pointed out, sphere sovereignty is the view that human life is \u2018differentiated into distinct spheres\u2019, each with its own authority structure which is not delegated to it by some external authority but is original to it. [\u00a016\u00a0] According to its best known advocate, Dutch theologian and politician Abraham Kuyper, the principle has a theological basis, namely \u2018the Sovereignty of the Triune God over the whole Cosmos, in all its spheres and kingdoms, visible and invisible\u2019. This \u2018primordial Sovereignty\u2019, he argued, \u2018eradiates in mankind in a threefold deduced supremacy\u2019: in the state, in society and in the church. [\u00a017\u00a0] Moreover, according to Kuyper, within society there are several particular \u2018social spheres\u2019\u2014including especially the family, business, science and art\u2014which \u2018do not derive the law of their life from the superiority of the state\u2019, but are rather subject directly to the highest authority of God himself. [\u00a018\u00a0] It follows, in the words of Kuyper\u2019s fellow reformed theologian, Herman Bavinck, that the state ought to \u2018recognize and maintain the various life spheres of family, church and culture\u2019 and should respect their independence. [\u00a019\u00a0]\n\nSubsidiarity and sphere sovereignty are not merely abstract principles. They have deep roots in Christian reflection on human nature and human sociality. In the thirteenth century, Thomas Aquinas modified the position taken by the Greek philosopher Aristotle, by maintaining that human beings are not only political animals, but also social animals. [\u00a020\u00a0] Aquinas recognised the existence of what German historian Otto von Gierke described as a \u2018manifold and graduated system\u2019 of \u2018intermediating units\u2019 lying between the individual on the one hand and the empire and church on the other. [\u00a021\u00a0] John Milbank has called this sort of social arrangement complex space , which means that society consists of a whole array of intermediate groups and institutions, such as guilds, trade unions, religious associations and universities, that are \u2018not simply subordinate to the greater whole\u2019, but rather are formed into a complex network of \u2018free associations and complex varying jurisdictions\u2019. [\u00a022\u00a0] This contrasts with what Milbank calls the simple space of liberal modernity, in which the only basic terms are the rights of individuals and the power of the state. [\u00a023\u00a0] In his ground-breaking work, Law and Revolution , Harold Berman has similarly argued that the most distinctive characteristic of the Western legal tradition has been \u2018the coexistence and competition within the same community of diverse jurisdictions and diverse legal systems\u2019, in which no particular community or institution is necessarily regarded as \u2018sovereign\u2019 in any absolute sense. [\u00a024\u00a0]\n\nWhat is it about Christian faith and practice which historically gave rise to this complex space in which communities and groups have enjoyed an inherent freedom to associate and govern themselves in order to achieve their particular purposes? The duality of church and state is an important part of the answer. Its roots lie in the teaching of Christ that his disciples ought to \u2018render to Caesar the things that are Caesar\u2019s and to God the things that are God\u2019s\u2019 ( Luke 20:25). As resident aliens, whose citizenship is heavenly ( I Peter 1:1, 2:11; Philippians 3:20; Ephesians 2:12, 19), [\u00a025\u00a0] Christians are counselled to submit to the authorities, acknowledging that they are instituted by God to punish evil and praise the good ( Romans 13:1-7; I Peter 2:13-14). However, in case of conflicting obligations, they are also required to obey God rather than men ( Acts 4:19, 5:29), for Christians are ambassadors of the kingdom of heaven ( II Corinthians 5:20; Ephesians 6:20) and owe their highest allegiance to Jesus Christ, who alone is King of kings and Lord of lords ( I Timothy 6:15; Revelation 17:14; 19:16).\n\nReflecting on these teachings, St Augustine of Hippo (354\u2013430) proposed that there are two cities: the earthly city characterised by love of self and the heavenly city characterised by love of God. [\u00a026\u00a0] Pope Gelasius I (492\u2013496) taught that whereas the role of kings and the role of priests had once been combined (such as when the Roman emperors bore the title pontifex maximus ), after Christ the two roles were separated on account of \u2018human weakness\u2019, each operating in \u2018its sphere of operation\u2019. [\u00a027\u00a0] Consequently there were \u2018two swords\u2019 by which the world is ruled: the consecrated authority of the priests and the royal power. [\u00a028\u00a0] Especially after the investiture contest of the eleventh and twelfth centuries, the Roman concept of jurisdiction was used by civil lawyers and canon lawyers to identify the particular matters that fell within the authority of church and state. [\u00a029\u00a0] In the striking words of \u00c9tienne de Tournai (1128\u20131203):\n\nAccording to Brian Tierney, it was this insistence on jurisdictional boundaries between popes and emperors, bishops and kings, priests and princes, that largely explains the emergence of what we today know as constitutional government. [\u00a031\u00a0] It meant, in practice, that \u2018none of the coexisting ecclesiastical and secular legal systems that constituted the western legal tradition could claim to be entirely all-inclusive or omnicompetent\u2019 and therefore \u2018each had to develop constitutional standards for locating and limiting sovereignty, for allocating governmental powers within such sovereignty, and for determining the basic rights and duties of members\u2019. [\u00a032\u00a0] In Law and Revolution , Harold Berman has shown how the Western legal tradition came to be characterised by a plurality of jurisdictions and legal systems\u2014not only ecclesiastical and imperial\u2014but also royal, urban, feudal, manorial and mercantile. Berman argues that \u2018this plurality of jurisdictions and legal systems\u2019 made \u2018the supremacy of law both necessary and possible\u2019. [\u00a033\u00a0] The result was the complex space to which John Milbank has referred, in which a diversity of \u2018intermediate\u2019 corporations and associations\u2014religious, scholarly, commercial and professional\u2014operated within an overarching framework of law, qualifying the power claims of secular rulers and helping to keep them within constitutional bounds. [\u00a034\u00a0]\n\nThe Apostle Paul\u2019s teaching was that rulers were servants of God, responsible to administer just judgment against wrongdoers ( Romans 13:4). [\u00a035\u00a0] This was consistent with the teaching of the Old Testament, which required kings and judges to enact just judgment ( Deuteronomy 1:16; 16:18). To fulfil this task, it was necessary that the judges were capable, God-fearing, trustworthy and averse to dishonest gain ( Exodus 18:13-23). In the striking language of Amos 5:24, righteous judgment is compared to a life-giving stream of water. Contrary to the argument of Professor Wolterstorff, [\u00a036\u00a0] the text does not separate judgment from justice. The passage literally reads: \u2018but let run down like water judgment and righteousness like a stream enduring\u2019. The two key Hebrew terms, mishpat usedaqah , are at the centre of the grammatical construction. The same occurs earlier in the passage, where the opposite ethical evaluation is expressed using the same grammatical construction: \u2018you who turn to wormwood judgment and righteousness in the earth cast down\u2019 ( Amos 5:7). This intimate association between the masculine mishpat (judgment) and the feminine tsedaqah (justice) appears many times in the Old Testament and is especially predicated of David ( II Samuel 8:15; II Chronicles 18:14), Solomon ( I Kings 10:9; II Chronicles 9:8), the ideal king Messiah ( Psalm 99:4; Jeremiah 23:5, 33:15) and fundamentally of God himself ( Isaiah 33:5; Jeremiah 9:24). [\u00a037\u00a0]\n\nIn New Testament times, the Caesars had increasingly asserted the prerogatives of deity, proclaiming themselves to be gods. [\u00a038\u00a0] Under the influence of Christian teaching, however, later Roman emperors \u2018abandoned their claim to be true divinity on earth and recognized instead in God the origin of their power\u2019. [\u00a039\u00a0] From as early as the eighth century, kings and emperors were expected at their coronations to swear oaths that they would, among other things, execute justice and mercy in their judgments, and later, that they would govern in accordance with the established customs and laws of the realm. [\u00a040\u00a0]\n\nIn his recent book, The Ways of Judgment , Professor O\u2019Donovan distinguishes between three conceptions of justice: justice-as-right, justice-as-virtue and justice-as-judgment. [\u00a041\u00a0] Justice-as-right is a state of affairs in which persons and things are in an altogether just set of relationships. Justice-as-virtue is an ordered disposition of the powers of the soul which disposes a person to act justly. Justice-as-judgment refers to the act of moral discrimination pursuant to which a wrong act or a wrong state of affairs is effectively set right. Justice-as-right is a presupposition of justice-as-judgment, which can only be fully enacted by those that possess justice-as-virtue. [\u00a042\u00a0] While the original creation was entirely good and therefore exemplified a just state of affairs ( Genesis 1:31), the fall from this primordial goodness necessitates judgment ( Genesis 3:14-19) and our need to recover the virtue of justice in and through the Gospel ( Romans 1:16-16-17).

Focussing on the Greek terms <i>dikaios</i> and <i>dikaiosune\u0304</i>, he argues that these terms are rarely used in the New Testament to denote a personal character trait and almost always refer or allude to just or right action.<a class=\"anchor\" id=\"content100note1anc\" name=\"content100note1anc\">\u00a0</a><a class=\"note\" href=\"#content100note1sym\">[\u00a01\u00a0]</a> This appears to distinguish his position from a virtue-based approach, which understands just conduct to be secondary to, and ultimately attributed to, an individual\u2019s personal virtue or character.<a class=\"anchor\" id=\"content100note2anc\" name=\"content100note2anc\">\u00a0</a><a class=\"note\" href=\"#content100note2sym\">[\u00a02\u00a0]</a></p>\n<p>It is not entirely clear, however, how far Professor Wolterstorff wishes to distinguish his position from virtue-ethics approaches because in several places he refers to justice as a virtue and he adopts the definition of justice proposed by the Roman jurist Ulpian, which is nothing other than a definition of the virtue<i> </i>of justice.<a class=\"anchor\" id=\"content100note3anc\" name=\"content100note3anc\">\u00a0</a><a class=\"note\" href=\"#content100note3sym\">[\u00a03\u00a0]</a> This is broadly consistent with the stance taken by Thomas Aquinas when he endorsed Isidore of Seville\u2019s definition of justice as the particular virtue that \u2018makes men capable of doing just actions\u2019.<a class=\"anchor\" id=\"content100note4anc\" name=\"content100note4anc\">\u00a0</a><a class=\"note\" href=\"#content100note4sym\">[\u00a04\u00a0]</a> Wolterstorff appears to acknowledge that human beings will not act justly unless they themselves have the character and disposition to do so.</p>\n<h3>Justice and Judgement</h3>\n<p>Also fundamental to Professor Wolterstorff\u2019s paper is the proposition that first order justice is distinct from and more fundamental than second order justice. In his longer study on the topic, <i>Justice: Rights and Wrongs</i>, Wolterstorff critiques the argument advanced by Professor Oliver O\u2019Donovan that the biblical texts place more emphasis on \u2018judgment\u2019 \u2013 and especially \u2018just judgment\u2019 \u2013 than they do on \u2018justice\u2019 conceived abstractly and generally.<a class=\"anchor\" id=\"content100note5anc\" name=\"content100note5anc\">\u00a0</a><a class=\"note\" href=\"#content100note5sym\">[\u00a05\u00a0]</a> According to Wolterstorff, O\u2019Donovan mistakenly considers that the key Hebrew word <i>mishpat</i>, which appears hundreds of times in the Old Testament, is properly to be understood as referring to the act of \u2018judgment\u2019, rather than the more abstract state of affairs that we call \u2018justice\u2019. This a controversy that I will take up further below.</p>\n<h3>Justice and Rights</h3>\n<p>A third distinctive of Professor Wolterstorff\u2019s argument is that the essence of justice is to accord others their <i>rights</i>. He acknowledges that this emphasis on rights might be confused with a \u2018possessive individualism\u2019 which is based, not on the Bible or on the Christian tradition, but on the secular philosophies of the Enlightenment. However, he argues that the idea of natural rights has a much older and more Christian and biblical provenance. In his book, <i>Justice: Rights and Wrongs</i>, he again takes issue with O\u2019Donovan on this question of the origin of rights, adopting an important study by Professor Brian Tierney which showed that church lawyers of the twelfth century were already using the Latin term <i>ius </i>in a way that designated the particular <i>subjective</i> rights to which individuals were legally entitled and not only to refer to an <i>objectively</i> just state of affairs.<a class=\"anchor\" id=\"content100note6anc\" name=\"content100note6anc\">\u00a0</a><a class=\"note\" href=\"#content100note6sym\">[\u00a06\u00a0]</a> More recently, however, Professor John Milbank has entered this controversy, arguing that this misses the point. The argument that was advanced by specialist scholars such as Michel Villey was not that there was no concept of subjective right (in the sense that an individual could have a particular <i>ius </i>in respect of some specific thing) but that the right was not <i>subjectively</i> <i>grounded</i> in the will and desire of the isolated individual.<a class=\"anchor\" id=\"content100note7anc\" name=\"content100note7anc\">\u00a0</a><a class=\"note\" href=\"#content100note7sym\">[\u00a07\u00a0]</a></p>\n<h2><b>P</b><b>ractical Consequences</b></h2>\n<h3><b>Human Rights</b> <b>and</b> <b>Anti-Discrimination Laws</b></h3>\n<p>This is not merely a theoretical argument.<a class=\"anchor\" id=\"content100note8anc\" name=\"content100note8anc\">\u00a0</a><a class=\"note\" href=\"#content100note8sym\">[\u00a08\u00a0]</a> These differences of opinion have practical implications. Professor Wolterstorff draws attention to the importance of rights-arguments for the advancement of many of the great social justice movements of the twentieth century. While these arguments were framed in the language of rights, he points out they were directed at various forms of systemic injustice. The American <i>Civil Rights Act</i> of 1964, for example, prohibited discrimination on the basis of race, colour, religion, or national origin in the provision of goods and services in any place of public accommodation, such as hotels, restaurants and theatres. Similarly, the <i>International Convention on the Elimination of All Forms of Racial Discrimination</i>, adopted by the General Assembly of the United Nations in 1965, required signatory states to take measures to eliminate all forms of discrimination on the basis of race, colour, descent, or national or ethnic origin if that discrimination has the purpose or effect of nullifying or impairing the recognition, enjoyment or exercise, on an equal footing, of human rights and fundamental freedoms in the political, economic, social, cultural or any other field of public life.</p>\n<p>Since the 1960s, the scope of anti-discrimination laws has expanded tremendously. There are now very long lists of protected attributes in most jurisdictions and the areas in which discrimination is unlawful have multiplied so that even many private associations and religious organisations are subject to anti-discrimination requirements. This raises significant concerns for such organisations because maintenance of their distinctive religious or other identity depends on their ability to adopt particular standards of membership or to employ staff who share their religious convictions. In most anti-discrimination laws, the rights of religious groups to maintain their unique character are protected by special carve-outs that run against the grain of such laws. Over time, however, the exceptions that protect religious freedom have contracted, as the underlying premises of anti-discrimination laws have been pressed to their logical conclusions.</p>\n<h3>Subjective Grounding of Rights</h3>\n<p>Why has this happened? As Professor Milbank has argued, rights have come to be understood as essentially individual and subjective in nature, not only in their legal expression, but also in their philosophical and theological foundations.<a class=\"anchor\" id=\"content100note9anc\" name=\"content100note9anc\">\u00a0</a><a class=\"note\" href=\"#content100note9sym\">[\u00a09\u00a0]</a> On this view, the individual right not to be discriminated against is considered more basic and fundamental than the right of a religious group or organisation to maintain its distinctive character. Accordingly, when there is a conflict between such rights, the individual right must prevail over the collective right. This is applied even to the right to religious freedom itself, which is increasingly confined to the personal and the private, while its corporate and public dimensions are progressively restricted. There is a lot at stake, therefore, in these debates about the origin and nature of human rights.<a class=\"anchor\" id=\"content100note10anc\" name=\"content100note10anc\">\u00a0</a><a class=\"note\" href=\"#content100note10sym\">[\u00a010\u00a0]</a></p>\n<p>Liberal social ontologies tend to understand all social formations and cultural groups\u2014including the state itself\u2014as compositions of individuals.<a class=\"anchor\" id=\"content100note11anc\" name=\"content100note11anc\">\u00a0</a><a class=\"note\" href=\"#content100note11sym\">[\u00a011\u00a0]</a> On this view, only individuals are ontologically real and have normative weight. Social groups exist to meet the needs and wants of individuals. They come into being when individuals deliberately create them or when they are recognised by some positive act of the state. This means that families, religious communities and cultural groups tend to be seen as special kinds of voluntary association, like any other voluntary relationship established within the free market. They have weight in moral, political and legal deliberation only to the extent that individuals or the state positively attribute significance to them. As a consequence, in any contest between the rights of an individual and the rights of a social group, the rights of the individual must have normative priority. If a group right is, in some particular circumstance, to prevail, it can only be because the group is a vehicle of the rights of the individuals that compose the group, and the collective sum of these individual rights outweighs the right of the disaffected individual. This is because the rights of individuals are regarded as more natural, basic and fundamental than group rights. In this way, as Benjamin Berger has put it, the \u2018[l]aw shapes religion in its own ideological image and likeness and conceptually confines it to the individual, choice-centred, and private dimensions of human life\u2019.<a class=\"anchor\" id=\"content100note12anc\" name=\"content100note12anc\">\u00a0</a><a class=\"note\" href=\"#content100note12sym\">[\u00a012\u00a0]</a></p>\n<h2><b>T</b><b>heological Perspectives</b></h2>\n<h3><b>Subsidiarity and sphere sovereignty</b></h3>\n<p>Within Roman Catholic social thought, the term <i>subsidiarity</i> has come to refer to a principle which resists the stark duality of individual and state that is characteristic of liberal political philosophy.<a class=\"anchor\" id=\"content100note13anc\" name=\"content100note13anc\">\u00a0</a><a class=\"note\" href=\"#content100note13sym\">[\u00a013\u00a0]</a> According to Pope John Paul II, the principle of subsidiarity recognises that:</p>\n<blockquote>a community of a higher order should not interfere in the internal life of a community of a lower order, depriving the latter of its functions, but rather should support it in case of need and help to coordinate its activity with the activities of the rest of society, always with a view to the common good.<a class=\"anchor\" id=\"content100note14anc\" name=\"content100note14anc\">\u00a0</a><a class=\"note\" href=\"#content100note14sym\">[\u00a014\u00a0]</a></blockquote>\n<p>Such an approach is often called <i>personalism</i>, because it seeks to affirm two important truths about humanity: firstly, the dignity of each individual person and, secondly, the embedding of each individual within a matrix of associations and communities. Human beings have inherent dignity, but this dignity does not isolate the individual from his or her social context and does not fixate, as Immanuel Kant did, on the autonomous will of the individual as the loadstar of ethical reasoning.<a class=\"anchor\" id=\"content100note15anc\" name=\"content100note15anc\">\u00a0</a><a class=\"note\" href=\"#content100note15sym\">[\u00a015\u00a0]</a></p>\n<p>Within Reformed Christian thought, a similar perspective is advanced under the name of <i>sphere sovereignty</i>. As Professor Wolterstorff has elsewhere pointed out, sphere sovereignty is the view that human life is \u2018differentiated into distinct spheres\u2019, each with its own authority structure which is not delegated to it by some external authority but is original to it.<a class=\"anchor\" id=\"content100note16anc\" name=\"content100note16anc\">\u00a0</a><a class=\"note\" href=\"#content100note16sym\">[\u00a016\u00a0]</a> According to its best known advocate, Dutch theologian and politician Abraham Kuyper, the principle has a theological basis, namely \u2018the Sovereignty of the Triune God over the whole Cosmos, in all its spheres and kingdoms, visible and invisible\u2019. This \u2018primordial Sovereignty\u2019, he argued, \u2018eradiates in mankind in a threefold deduced supremacy\u2019: in the state, in society and in the church.<a class=\"anchor\" id=\"content100note17anc\" name=\"content100note17anc\">\u00a0</a><a class=\"note\" href=\"#content100note17sym\">[\u00a017\u00a0]</a> Moreover, according to Kuyper, within society there are several particular \u2018social spheres\u2019\u2014including especially the family, business, science and art\u2014which \u2018do not derive the law of their life from the superiority of the state\u2019, but are rather subject directly to the highest authority of God himself.<a class=\"anchor\" id=\"content100note18anc\" name=\"content100note18anc\">\u00a0</a><a class=\"note\" href=\"#content100note18sym\">[\u00a018\u00a0]</a> It follows, in the words of Kuyper\u2019s fellow reformed theologian, Herman Bavinck, that the state ought to \u2018recognize and maintain the various life spheres of family, church and culture\u2019 and should respect their independence.<a class=\"anchor\" id=\"content100note19anc\" name=\"content100note19anc\">\u00a0</a><a class=\"note\" href=\"#content100note19sym\">[\u00a019\u00a0]</a></p>\n<h3><b>Simple Space or Complex Space?</b></h3>\n<p>Subsidiarity and sphere sovereignty are not merely abstract principles. They have deep roots in Christian reflection on human nature and human sociality. In the thirteenth century, Thomas Aquinas modified the position taken by the Greek philosopher Aristotle, by maintaining that human beings are not only <i>political </i>animals, but also <i>social </i>animals.<a class=\"anchor\" id=\"content100note20anc\" name=\"content100note20anc\">\u00a0</a><a class=\"note\" href=\"#content100note20sym\">[\u00a020\u00a0]</a> Aquinas recognised the existence of what German historian Otto von Gierke described as a \u2018manifold and graduated system\u2019 of \u2018intermediating units\u2019 lying between the individual on the one hand and the empire and church on the other.<a class=\"anchor\" id=\"content100note21anc\" name=\"content100note21anc\">\u00a0</a><a class=\"note\" href=\"#content100note21sym\">[\u00a021\u00a0]</a> John Milbank has called this sort of social arrangement <i>complex space</i>, which means that society consists of a whole array of intermediate groups and institutions, such as guilds, trade unions, religious associations and universities, that are \u2018not simply subordinate to the greater whole\u2019, but rather are formed into a complex network of \u2018free associations and complex varying jurisdictions\u2019.<a class=\"anchor\" id=\"content100note22anc\" name=\"content100note22anc\">\u00a0</a><a class=\"note\" href=\"#content100note22sym\">[\u00a022\u00a0]</a> This contrasts with what Milbank calls the <i>simple space</i> of liberal modernity, in which the only basic terms are the rights of individuals and the power of the state.<a class=\"anchor\" id=\"content100note23anc\" name=\"content100note23anc\">\u00a0</a><a class=\"note\" href=\"#content100note23sym\">[\u00a023\u00a0]</a> In his ground-breaking work, <i>Law and Revolution</i>, Harold Berman has similarly argued that the most distinctive characteristic of the Western legal tradition has been \u2018the coexistence and competition within the same community of diverse jurisdictions and diverse legal systems\u2019, in which no particular community or institution is necessarily regarded as \u2018sovereign\u2019 in any absolute sense.<a class=\"anchor\" id=\"content100note24anc\" name=\"content100note24anc\">\u00a0</a><a class=\"note\" href=\"#content100note24sym\">[\u00a024\u00a0]</a></p>\n<p>What is it about Christian faith and practice which historically gave rise to this complex space in which communities and groups have enjoyed an inherent freedom to associate and govern themselves in order to achieve their particular purposes? The duality of church and state is an important part of the answer. Its roots lie in the teaching of Christ that his disciples ought to \u2018render to Caesar the things that are Caesar\u2019s and to God the things that are God\u2019s\u2019 (<i>Luke </i>20:25).

However, in case of conflicting obligations, they are also required to obey God rather than men (<i>Acts </i>4:19, 5:29), for Christians are ambassadors of the kingdom of heaven (<i>II</i> <i>Corinthians</i> 5:20; <i>Ephesians </i>6:20) and owe their highest allegiance to Jesus Christ, who alone is King of kings and Lord of lords (<i>I Timothy</i> 6:15; <i>Revelation</i> 17:14; 19:16).</p>\n<h3>Two Loves, Two Cities</h3>\n<p>Reflecting on these teachings, St Augustine of Hippo (354\u2013430) proposed that there are two cities: the earthly city characterised by love of self and the heavenly city characterised by love of God.<a class=\"anchor\" id=\"content100note26anc\" name=\"content100note26anc\">\u00a0</a><a class=\"note\" href=\"#content100note26sym\">[\u00a026\u00a0]</a> Pope Gelasius I (492\u2013496) taught that whereas the role of kings and the role of priests had once been combined (such as when the Roman emperors bore the title <i>pontifex maximus</i>), after Christ the two roles were separated on account of \u2018human weakness\u2019, each operating in \u2018its sphere of operation\u2019.<a class=\"anchor\" id=\"content100note27anc\" name=\"content100note27anc\">\u00a0</a><a class=\"note\" href=\"#content100note27sym\">[\u00a027\u00a0]</a> Consequently there were \u2018two swords\u2019 by which the world is ruled: the consecrated authority of the priests and the royal power.<a class=\"anchor\" id=\"content100note28anc\" name=\"content100note28anc\">\u00a0</a><a class=\"note\" href=\"#content100note28sym\">[\u00a028\u00a0]</a> Especially after the investiture contest of the eleventh and twelfth centuries, the Roman concept of jurisdiction was used by civil lawyers and canon lawyers to identify the particular matters that fell within the authority of church and state.<a class=\"anchor\" id=\"content100note29anc\" name=\"content100note29anc\">\u00a0</a><a class=\"note\" href=\"#content100note29sym\">[\u00a029\u00a0]</a> In the striking words of \u00c9tienne de Tournai (1128\u20131203):</p>\n<blockquote>In the same city under the same king there are two people.

The king of the city is Christ. There are two peoples and two orders in the church, clerics and laypeople. There are two types of life, the spiritual life and the life of the flesh. There are two types of government, priestly authority and princely power. There are two jurisdictions, divine and human justice, rights, and equity.

To fulfil this task, it was necessary that the judges were capable, God-fearing, trustworthy and averse to dishonest gain (<i>Exodus</i> 18:13-23). In the striking language of <i>Amos</i> 5:24, righteous judgment is compared to a life-giving stream of water. Contrary to the argument of Professor Wolterstorff,<a class=\"anchor\" id=\"content100note36anc\" name=\"content100note36anc\">\u00a0</a><a class=\"note\" href=\"#content100note36sym\">[\u00a036\u00a0]</a> the text does not separate judgment from justice. The passage literally reads: \u2018but let run down like water judgment and righteousness like a stream enduring\u2019. The two key Hebrew terms, <i>mishpat usedaqah</i>, are at the centre of the grammatical construction. The same occurs earlier in the passage, where the opposite ethical evaluation is expressed using the same grammatical construction: \u2018you who turn to wormwood<i> </i>judgment and righteousness in the earth cast down\u2019 (<i>Amos</i> 5:7). This intimate association between the masculine <i>mishpat </i>(judgment) and the feminine <i>tsedaqah</i> (justice) appears many times in the Old Testament and is especially predicated of David (<i>II</i> <i>Samuel</i> 8:15; <i>II Chronicles</i> 18:14), Solomon (<i>I Kings</i> 10:9; <i>II Chronicles</i> 9:8), the ideal king Messiah (<i>Psalm</i> 99:4; <i>Jeremiah</i> 23:5, 33:15) and fundamentally of God himself (<i>Isaiah</i> 33:5; <i>Jeremiah</i> 9:24).<a class=\"anchor\" id=\"content100note37anc\" name=\"content100note37anc\">\u00a0</a><a class=\"note\" href=\"#content100note37sym\">[\u00a037\u00a0]</a></p>\n<p>In New Testament times, the Caesars had increasingly asserted the prerogatives of deity, proclaiming themselves to be gods.<a class=\"anchor\" id=\"content100note38anc\" name=\"content100note38anc\">\u00a0</a><a class=\"note\" href=\"#content100note38sym\">[\u00a038\u00a0]</a> Under the influence of Christian teaching, however, later Roman emperors \u2018abandoned their claim to be true divinity on earth and recognized instead in God the origin of their power\u2019.<a class=\"anchor\" id=\"content100note39anc\" name=\"content100note39anc\">\u00a0</a><a class=\"note\" href=\"#content100note39sym\">[\u00a039\u00a0]</a> From as early as the eighth century, kings and emperors were expected at their coronations to swear oaths that they would, among other things, execute justice and mercy in their judgments, and later, that they would govern in accordance with the established customs and laws of the realm.<a class=\"anchor\" id=\"content100note40anc\" name=\"content100note40anc\">\u00a0</a><a class=\"note\" href=\"#content100note40sym\">[\u00a040\u00a0]</a></p>\n<p>In his recent book, <i>The Ways of Judgment</i>, Professor O\u2019Donovan distinguishes between three conceptions of justice: justice-as-right, justice-as-virtue and justice-as-judgment.<a class=\"anchor\" id=\"content100note41anc\" name=\"content100note41anc\">\u00a0</a><a class=\"note\" href=\"#content100note41sym\">[\u00a041\u00a0]</a> Justice-as-right is a state of affairs in which persons and things are in an altogether just set of relationships. Justice-as-virtue is an ordered disposition of the powers of the soul which disposes a person to act justly. Justice-as-judgment refers to the act of moral discrimination pursuant to which a wrong act or a wrong state of affairs is effectively set right. Justice-as-right is a presupposition of justice-as-judgment, which can only be fully enacted by those that possess justice-as-virtue.<a class=\"anchor\" id=\"content100note42anc\" name=\"content100note42anc\">\u00a0</a><a class=\"note\" href=\"#content100note42sym\">[\u00a042\u00a0]</a> While the original creation was entirely good and therefore exemplified a just state of affairs (<i>Genesis </i>1:31), the fall from this primordial goodness necessitates judgment (<i>Genesis </i>3:14-19) and our need to recover the virtue of justice in and through the Gospel (<i>Romans </i>1:16-16-17).

    "bodyText": "Nicholas Wolterstorff\u2019s fascinating and helpful essay on justice\nand rights is thought-provoking in many respects. As a lawyer, I\nhardly need reminding, of course, of the centrality of justice in all\nthat I do. Without what Wolterstorff calls second order justice,\n(that is, the laws, sanctions and systems that secure first-order\njustice), not only would I have no professional work to do, but I\nwould also have no students to teach.\n\nThis brief response\noffers some thoughts about Wolterstorff\u2019s analysis in the context\nof my own work in family law.\n\nWolsterstorff\u2019s\nessay is greatly concerned with rights. That is unsurprising for two\nreasons. First, much of law is indeed about vindicating rights, and\nso the terms \u2018rights\u2019 and \u2018justice\u2019 necessarily go hand in\nhand. Secondly, rights talk is ubiquitous in many international and\nnational settings, notably in the U.S. which is, with respect,\nparticularly intoxicated with \u2018rights\u2019, for better or for worse.\nThat is, rights are a hugely important part of American political\ndiscourse. A great many social arguments are fought out on the\nbattlefield of the courtroom by reference to claims of constitutional\nrights.\n\nThis\nis a culturally specific phenomenon, and we must guard against either\nan assumption of its universality or a belief that a rights-oriented\nsociety is a manifestation of a lived-out Christianity. The\ncentrality of rights-talk in western societies may be contrasted with\nthe tradition of eastern cultures such as China. Traditionally, the\nChinese recognised the enacted or \u201cpositive\u201d law, called \u201cfa\u201d,\nwhich meant the rules prescribed by an earthly ruler. However, in\ntraditional Confucian thought, there was generally a suspicion of fa .\nIt was seen to be much better for the preservation of harmony and\norder in the universe that social relations should be governed by\n\u201cli\u201d, the ethics, taboos, ceremonies and customs of the\ncommunity. The distrust of fa is demonstrated in the introduction to the oldest datable code of law\nin China, the Tso\nChuan (535\nBC) in which it was said:\n\nThe\nancient kings, who weighed matters very carefully before establishing\nordinances, did not [write down] their systems of punishments,\nfearing to awaken a litigious spirit among the people. But since all\ncrimes cannot be prevented, they set up the barrier of righteousness,\nbound the people by administrative ordinances, treated them according\nto just usage, guarded them with good faith, and surrounded them with\nbenevolence . . . But when the people know that there are laws\nregulating punishments, they have no respectful fear of authority. A\nlitigious spirit awakes, invoking the letter of the law, and trusting\nthat evil actions will not fall under its provisions. [\u00a01\u00a0]\n\nA\nsimilar pattern may be seen in Japan, where honour and good faith\nhave traditionally been seen as important factors in maintaining\nrelations. [\u00a02\u00a0] In the latter half of the 19th century, Japan adopted a legal system\nwhich was modelled substantially on the legal codes of continental\nEurope. This \u201cwestern\u201d idea of law was, however, grafted onto\ntraditional Japanese methods of social ordering. For a variety of\nreasons, including cultural inhibitions, the limited number of\nlawyers, [\u00a03\u00a0] and the high costs associated with judicial procedures, there has in\nthe past been a limited use of courts to adjudicate disputes. [\u00a04\u00a0] As Abe and Nottage write, \u201cmost disputes are settled either by\nnegotiation between parties or through mediation services provided by\ncourts or other ADR procedures, before developing into lawsuits\u201d. [\u00a05\u00a0]\n\nI was struck by the\nongoing relevance of this only recently in a discussion with senior\nstaff of the Ministry of Justice in Singapore. Singapore has for a\nlong time restricted the intake of students to its law schools. Many\nSingaporeans go overseas to study, but only a limited number of law\nschools in other countries are recognised as providing a training\nthat will allow Singaporean students to become legally qualified in\ntheir own country.  The senior manager of the Justice Department\nexplained to me that the Singaporean government did not want to have\nmany lawyers because it did not want the country to become an overly\nlitigious society. She referenced Chinese cultural values in support\nof this.\n\nOf course, a society\nthat does not have a robust legal system through which the panoply of\nhuman rights, property rights and contractual rights are protected by\nan independent judiciary, is gravely deficient. However, reflection\non the values of other successful cultures is an important corrective\nto any assumption that a rights-based order of the kind that exists\nin some of the more litigious Western societies gives effect to\nChristian beliefs.\n\nNot\nevery area of law involves consideration of rights. Certainly, rights\ntalk is not very helpful in the family law context. Yes, the right to\nbodily integrity, the right to dignity and a variety of other rights\ncould be invoked to explain why it is that we must tackle the scourge\nof domestic violence. However, a duty based upon agape might be equally or more compelling as an explanation for why men\nshould not beat their loved ones, whether out of rage or alcohol or\ndrug-fuelled disinhibition.\n\nWhen it comes to\nparenting arrangements after separation, which is where most\ndisputation occurs, rights are unhelpful. What is needed, for the\nmost part, is cooperation and compromise when there may be no\nparticularly good solutions. Counselling and mediation are frontline\nforms of assistance to help parents reach child-focused parenting\narrangements. Laws have little of real value to add to the resolution\nof such conflicts unless a court decision is necessary.\n\nThe limitation of a\nrights analysis may be illustrated by the problem of relocation\ndisputes. These are cases where the primary caregiver, almost\ninvariably the mother, wants to relocate a long distance from the\nfather and take the children with her. Often there are good reasons\nfor this, such as wanting to go \u2018home\u2019 to where there is parental\nor other family support, or furthering a new relationship.\n\nFamily\nbreakdown brings two legitimate claims into conflict. The first is\nthe claim to autonomy. As one senior Australian judge commented: [\u00a06\u00a0]\n\n\u201cOne of the objects of modern family law statutes\u2026 is to enable\nparties to a broken relationship to start a new life for themselves,\nto control their own future destinies and, where desired, to form new\nrelationships, free from unnecessary interference from a former\nspouse or partner or from a court.\u201d\n\nOn\nthe other hand, parents have obligations towards their children, and\nthis will ordinarily involve an obligation on each parent to support\nand protect the children\u2019s relationship with the other. Marriage\nmay be freely dissoluble in an era of no-fault divorce; but\nparenthood is not. [\u00a07\u00a0]\n\nThe tension between\nthe right to post-separation autonomy and the benefit to children of\nmaintaining a close relationship with both their parents is\nparticularly acute in relocation cases. If the father cannot move to\nwhere the mother wants to live, then very difficult decisions need to\nbe made about where the best interests of children lie in the\ncircumstances, given the conflicting, but legitimate desires and\naspirations of each parent.\n\nThe analysis is not\nparticularly helped by rights-talk, for if mothers or fathers assert\ntheir rights \u2013 and they do \u2013 what they mean, not infrequently, is\nthat their interests should take precedence over the interests of the\nother parent or the children.\n\nNor\nis it really helpful to ask what is \u2018just\u2019.  I have a view on the\njustice issue in the abstract. To quote two other senior Australia\njudges: [\u00a08\u00a0]\n\nThe reality is that maternity and\npaternity always have an impact upon the wishes and mobility of\nparents: obligations both legal and moral, the latter sometimes\nlasting a lifetime, restrictive of personal choice and movement have\nbeen incurred.\n\nMy\nstarting point, in thinking about what is just, is that our\nobligations to our children trump our rights. We have obligations to\nthe children and to our former partner, that put considerable restraints upon our\nautonomy. This is so whether we have entered into the covenant of\nmarriage, or have made an implied commitment to the sexual partner\nand any future child by engaging in sexual intercourse that may\nresult in a child\u2019s birth. This does not mean that ordinarily\nmothers should be restrained from taking the children away from the\nlocation where the father happens to live. Parenting after separation\ndoes not rest upon the rule in musical chairs that you need to remain\nwherever you happen to be when the music stops. It must always be\nasked whether fathers can move to where the mothers want to live,\neven if this is difficult. Sometimes though, it really may be\nimpossible. The divorced or unmarried partner may have no legal right\nto live and work in the other parent\u2019s country of origin.\n\nEven if I have a\nprima facie view that the responsibility to protect the children\u2019s\nrelationship with the other parents should ordinarily take precedence\nover personal fulfillment, I have to acknowledge that the issues are\nnot often resolved by appeals to a preconceived idea of what is just.\n\nMy\ncolleagues and I followed 80 parents in 70 families who had\nrelocation disputes over some five years. [\u00a09\u00a0] The circumstances of these parents were enormously varied. A few of\nthe mothers had been subjected to serious violence. Some fathers had,\nfrom the mothers\u2019 accounts at least, a very limited sense of\nresponsibility towards their children. Memorably, one mother\ndescribed her former partner as a \u2018hands-on parent\u2019. He always\nhanded on the care of his young children to a woman in his life \u2013\nhis mother, or his latest girlfriend. [\u00a010\u00a0] Yet he strongly opposed the relocation of the children\u2019s mother to\na place where she had more family support. In other cases, the\nfathers were evidently extraordinarily dedicated to the wellbeing of\ntheir children. Of course, the accounts of each of our interviewees\nwas coloured by their own perspective. In only ten cases did we hear\nboth parents\u2019 stories.\n\nWhat\nwas clear from the research was that where children did have a close\nrelationship with the non-resident parent, a move a long distance\nfrom that parent was detrimental to the children\u2019s wellbeing.\nVideo-technology and the ease of plane travel diminished children\u2019s\nsense of loss but did not eradicate it. [\u00a011\u00a0]\n\nThis brings me to my\nfinal observation on Wolsterstorff\u2019s very helpful analysis. Second\norder justice is not always about rights. In the family law context,\nsecond order justice provides a decision-maker when parents cannot\nagree. The family law judge must make decisions about what is in the\nbest interests of children with little reference to rights. That it\nis a legal process at all may seem puzzling to the outside observer;\nbut sometimes there are factual issues of great significance to\ndetermine, such as the extent of domestic violence or allegations of\nchild sexual abuse. A good family law system needs to depend heavily\non appropriately qualified medical or psychology-trained experts who\ncan offer opinions on what is likely to be in the best interests of\nchildren.\n\nFamily law judges\ndon\u2019t really seek to administer justice in parenting cases. We ask\nof them not that their decisions be just but that they be wise. The\nsecond order justice is what litigants have a \u2018right\u2019 to \u2013 a\nright to present their case to an independent decision-maker who will\ndeliver Solomonic justice (but often without the benefit of Solomon\u2019s\nwisdom). Family law thus complicates Wolferstorff\u2019s distinction\nbetween first and second order justice.\n\nSo as a Christian,\nwhat aspect of the faith is most important to me in working in this\ndifficult area of family law? It is not Isaiah 61, pertinent as this\nis in so many other societal contexts. My role is to ask myself how\nwe can resolve these difficult family law disputes in ways that are\nmost protective of children and which reduce, as far as possible, the\nlevels of conflict between parents.\n\nIn\nthis respect, I believe the innovation to the Australian family law\nsystem in which I have been involved that will, in the long-term,\nprove to have been most valuable, was the development of Family\nRelationship Centres across the country. These centres, fully funded\nby government, provide an early intervention strategy in the\naftermath of relationship breakdown and an alternative to resolving\nparenting issues after separation through lawyers and courts. [\u00a012\u00a0] They aim to help parents in a holistic way to navigate the transition\nfrom parenting together to parenting apart. The staff, at intake,\nrefer parents to the range of different services that they might need\nin the aftermath of separation and offer free, or almost free\nmediation.\n\nYes,\nas lawyers we must pursue justice and where appropriate, seek to\nvindicate rights; but we should beware lest our thinking about\njustice be dominated by a rights paradigm. Blessed, said Jesus, are\nthe peacemakers. In his teaching in the Sermon on the Mount he urged\nus at times not to pursue our rights. \u201cIf\nanyone wants to sue you and take your shirt, hand over your coat as\nwell.\u00a0If anyone forces you to go one mile, go with them two\nmiles\u201d (Matthew 5:40-41).\u00a0Relationships\nmay matter more than rights in certain situations. Loving our enemies\nmay be better than suing them. It is not that a focus on rights,\nparticularly the rights of others, is misplaced \u2013 not at all \u2013\nbut in Jesus\u2019 teaching, justice is contextualised within a broader\nethical and relational framework.\n\n[\u00a01\u00a0] Quoted\n\tin Needham J and Ronan C, The\n\tShorter Science and Civilization in China (Cambridge UP, Cambridge, 1970), Ch 16.\n\n[\u00a02\u00a0] See\n\tHaley J O, T he\n\tSpirit of Japanese Law (University of Georgia Press, Athens and London, 1998), pp\u00a0162\u2013167.\n\n[\u00a03\u00a0] Kawashima\n\tT, \u201cDispute Resolution in Contemporary Japan\u201d in Taylor von\n\tMehren A (ed), Law\n\tin Japan: The Legal Order in a Changing Society (Harvard\n\tUP, Cambridge, 1963), p 41.\n\n[\u00a04\u00a0] See,\n\teg, Ramseyer M J and Nakazato M, Japanese Law: An Economic Approach (University of Chicago Press, Chicago and London, 1999), pp 91ff;\n\tDavis J W S, Dispute\n\tResolution in Japan (Kluwer Law International, Den Haag, 1996), pp 124ff.\n\n[\u00a05\u00a0] Abe\n\tM and Nottage L, \u201cJapanese Law: An Overview\u201d [2008] JPLRes 1:\n\tavailable at http://www.asianlii.org/jp/other/JPLRes/2008/1.html).\n\n[\u00a06\u00a0] AMS v AIF (1999) 199\n\tCLR 160 at 208,\n\tKirby J.\n\n[\u00a07\u00a0] Parkinson, P, Family Law and\n\tthe Indissolubility of Parenthood ,\n\t(New York: Cambridge UP (2011). Once, family law was built upon the\n\tindissolubility of marriage. Now, marriage is freely dissoluble, but\n\twestern societies have had to come to terms with the fact that\n\tparenthood is not so readily dissolved. Parents remain connected to\n\ttheir former partners through their children. Divorce, therefore, is\n\tnot the end of the family, but a restructuring of the continuing\n\tfamily in two different households.\n\n[\u00a08\u00a0] U v U (2002)\n\t211 CLR 238 at 262, Gummow and Callinan JJ.\n\n[\u00a09\u00a0] A summary of our findings can be found in Parkinson P & Cashmore ,\n\tJ, \u2018Reforming Relocation\n\tLaw \u2013 An Evidence-based Approach\u2019 (2015) 53 Family\n\tCourt Review 23-39.

For most, life improved\n\tover time, and they were able to adjust to their circumstances\n\tparticularly if they could see the benefit to the children of having\n\tstayed in reasonable proximity to their father.

That is unsurprising for two\nreasons. First, much of law is indeed about vindicating rights, and\nso the terms \u2018rights\u2019 and \u2018justice\u2019 necessarily go hand in\nhand. Secondly, rights talk is ubiquitous in many international and\nnational settings, notably in the U.S. which is, with respect,\nparticularly intoxicated with \u2018rights\u2019, for better or for worse.\nThat is, rights are a hugely important part of American political\ndiscourse. A great many social arguments are fought out on the\nbattlefield of the courtroom by reference to claims of constitutional\nrights.  \n</p>\n<p>This\nis a culturally specific phenomenon, and we must guard against either\nan assumption of its universality or a belief that a rights-oriented\nsociety is a manifestation of a lived-out Christianity. The\ncentrality of rights-talk in western societies may be contrasted with\nthe tradition of eastern cultures such as China. Traditionally, the\nChinese recognised the enacted or \u201cpositive\u201d law, called \u201cfa\u201d,\nwhich meant the rules prescribed by an earthly ruler. However, in\ntraditional Confucian thought, there was generally a suspicion of <i>fa</i>.\nIt was seen to be much better for the preservation of harmony and\norder in the universe that social relations should be governed by\n\u201cli\u201d, the ethics, taboos, ceremonies and customs of the\ncommunity. The distrust of <i>fa</i>\nis demonstrated in the introduction to the oldest datable code of law\nin China, the <i>Tso\nChuan </i>(535\nBC) in which it was said:</p>\n<blockquote><p>The\nancient kings, who weighed matters very carefully before establishing\nordinances, did not [write down] their systems of punishments,\nfearing to awaken a litigious spirit among the people. But since all\ncrimes cannot be prevented, they set up the barrier of righteousness,\nbound the people by administrative ordinances, treated them according\nto just usage, guarded them with good faith, and surrounded them with\nbenevolence . . . But when the people know that there are laws\nregulating punishments, they have no respectful fear of authority. A\nlitigious spirit awakes, invoking the letter of the law, and trusting\nthat evil actions will not fall under its provisions.<a class=\"anchor\" id=\"content100note1anc\" name=\"content100note1anc\">\u00a0</a><a class=\"note\" href=\"#content100note1sym\">[\u00a01\u00a0]</a></p></blockquote>\n<p>The\nancient kings, who weighed matters very carefully before establishing\nordinances, did not [write down] their systems of punishments,\nfearing to awaken a litigious spirit among the people.

This \u201cwestern\u201d idea of law was, however, grafted onto\ntraditional Japanese methods of social ordering. For a variety of\nreasons, including cultural inhibitions, the limited number of\nlawyers,<a class=\"anchor\" id=\"content100note3anc\" name=\"content100note3anc\">\u00a0</a><a class=\"note\" href=\"#content100note3sym\">[\u00a03\u00a0]</a>\nand the high costs associated with judicial procedures, there has in\nthe past been a limited use of courts to adjudicate disputes.<a class=\"anchor\" id=\"content100note4anc\" name=\"content100note4anc\">\u00a0</a><a class=\"note\" href=\"#content100note4sym\">[\u00a04\u00a0]</a>\nAs Abe and Nottage write, \u201cmost disputes are settled either by\nnegotiation between parties or through mediation services provided by\ncourts or other ADR procedures, before developing into lawsuits\u201d.<a class=\"anchor\" id=\"content100note5anc\" name=\"content100note5anc\">\u00a0</a><a class=\"note\" href=\"#content100note5sym\">[\u00a05\u00a0]</a></p>\n<p>I was struck by the\nongoing relevance of this only recently in a discussion with senior\nstaff of the Ministry of Justice in Singapore. Singapore has for a\nlong time restricted the intake of students to its law schools. Many\nSingaporeans go overseas to study, but only a limited number of law\nschools in other countries are recognised as providing a training\nthat will allow Singaporean students to become legally qualified in\ntheir own country.  The senior manager of the Justice Department\nexplained to me that the Singaporean government did not want to have\nmany lawyers because it did not want the country to become an overly\nlitigious society. She referenced Chinese cultural values in support\nof this. \n</p>\n<p>Of course, a society\nthat does not have a robust legal system through which the panoply of\nhuman rights, property rights and contractual rights are protected by\nan independent judiciary, is gravely deficient. However, reflection\non the values of other successful cultures is an important corrective\nto any assumption that a rights-based order of the kind that exists\nin some of the more litigious Western societies gives effect to\nChristian beliefs.</p>\n<h2>Family law and the maintenance of relationships</h2>\n<p>Not\nevery area of law involves consideration of rights. Certainly, rights\ntalk is not very helpful in the family law context. Yes, the right to\nbodily integrity, the right to dignity and a variety of other rights\ncould be invoked to explain why it is that we must tackle the scourge\nof domestic violence. However, a duty based upon <i>agape</i>\nmight be equally or more compelling as an explanation for why men\nshould not beat their loved ones, whether out of rage or alcohol or\ndrug-fuelled disinhibition. \n</p>\n<p>When it comes to\nparenting arrangements after separation, which is where most\ndisputation occurs, rights are unhelpful. What is needed, for the\nmost part, is cooperation and compromise when there may be no\nparticularly good solutions. Counselling and mediation are frontline\nforms of assistance to help parents reach child-focused parenting\narrangements. Laws have little of real value to add to the resolution\nof such conflicts unless a court decision is necessary. \n</p>\n<p>The limitation of a\nrights analysis may be illustrated by the problem of relocation\ndisputes. These are cases where the primary caregiver, almost\ninvariably the mother, wants to relocate a long distance from the\nfather and take the children with her. Often there are good reasons\nfor this, such as wanting to go \u2018home\u2019 to where there is parental\nor other family support, or furthering a new relationship. \n</p>\n<p>Family\nbreakdown brings two legitimate claims into conflict. The first is\nthe claim to autonomy. As one senior Australian judge commented:<a class=\"anchor\" id=\"content100note6anc\" name=\"content100note6anc\">\u00a0</a><a class=\"note\" href=\"#content100note6sym\">[\u00a06\u00a0]</a></p>\n<blockquote><p>\n\u201cOne of the objects of modern family law statutes\u2026 is to enable\nparties to a broken relationship to start a new life for themselves,\nto control their own future destinies and, where desired, to form new\nrelationships, free from unnecessary interference from a former\nspouse or partner or from a court.\u201d</p></blockquote>\n<p>\n\u201cOne of the objects of modern family law statutes\u2026 is to enable\nparties to a broken relationship to start a new life for themselves,\nto control their own future destinies and, where desired, to form new\nrelationships, free from unnecessary interference from a former\nspouse or partner or from a court.\u201d</p>\n<p>On\nthe other hand, parents have obligations towards their children, and\nthis will ordinarily involve an obligation on each parent to support\nand protect the children\u2019s relationship with the other. Marriage\nmay be freely dissoluble in an era of no-fault divorce; but\nparenthood is not.<a class=\"anchor\" id=\"content100note7anc\" name=\"content100note7anc\">\u00a0</a><a class=\"note\" href=\"#content100note7sym\">[\u00a07\u00a0]</a>\n</p>\n<p>The tension between\nthe right to post-separation autonomy and the benefit to children of\nmaintaining a close relationship with both their parents is\nparticularly acute in relocation cases. If the father cannot move to\nwhere the mother wants to live, then very difficult decisions need to\nbe made about where the best interests of children lie in the\ncircumstances, given the conflicting, but legitimate desires and\naspirations of each parent. \n</p>\n<p>The analysis is not\nparticularly helped by rights-talk, for if mothers or fathers assert\ntheir rights \u2013 and they do \u2013 what they mean, not infrequently, is\nthat their interests should take precedence over the interests of the\nother parent or the children.</p>\n<p>Nor\nis it really helpful to ask what is \u2018just\u2019.  I have a view on the\njustice issue in the abstract. To quote two other senior Australia\njudges:<a class=\"anchor\" id=\"content100note8anc\" name=\"content100note8anc\">\u00a0</a><a class=\"note\" href=\"#content100note8sym\">[\u00a08\u00a0]</a></p>\n<blockquote><p>The reality is that maternity and\npaternity always have an impact upon the wishes and mobility of\nparents: obligations both legal and moral, the latter sometimes\nlasting a lifetime, restrictive of personal choice and movement have\nbeen incurred.</p></blockquote>\n<p>The reality is that maternity and\npaternity always have an impact upon the wishes and mobility of\nparents: obligations both legal and moral, the latter sometimes\nlasting a lifetime, restrictive of personal choice and movement have\nbeen incurred.</p>\n<p>My\nstarting point, in thinking about what is just, is that our\nobligations to our children trump our rights. We have obligations to\nthe children <i>and</i>\nto our former partner, that put considerable restraints upon our\nautonomy. This is so whether we have entered into the covenant of\nmarriage, or have made an implied commitment to the sexual partner\nand any future child by engaging in sexual intercourse that may\nresult in a child\u2019s birth. This does not mean that ordinarily\nmothers should be restrained from taking the children away from the\nlocation where the father happens to live. Parenting after separation\ndoes not rest upon the rule in musical chairs that you need to remain\nwherever you happen to be when the music stops. It must always be\nasked whether fathers can move to where the mothers want to live,\neven if this is difficult. Sometimes though, it really may be\nimpossible. The divorced or unmarried partner may have no legal right\nto live and work in the other parent\u2019s country of origin.</p>\n<p>Even if I have a\nprima facie view that the responsibility to protect the children\u2019s\nrelationship with the other parents should ordinarily take precedence\nover personal fulfillment, I have to acknowledge that the issues are\nnot often resolved by appeals to a preconceived idea of what is just.\n</p>\n<p>My\ncolleagues and I followed 80 parents in 70 families who had\nrelocation disputes over some five years.<a class=\"anchor\" id=\"content100note9anc\" name=\"content100note9anc\">\u00a0</a><a class=\"note\" href=\"#content100note9sym\">[\u00a09\u00a0]</a>\nThe circumstances of these parents were enormously varied. A few of\nthe mothers had been subjected to serious violence. Some fathers had,\nfrom the mothers\u2019 accounts at least, a very limited sense of\nresponsibility towards their children. Memorably, one mother\ndescribed her former partner as a \u2018hands-on parent\u2019. He always\nhanded on the care of his young children to a woman in his life \u2013\nhis mother, or his latest girlfriend.<a class=\"anchor\" id=\"content100note10anc\" name=\"content100note10anc\">\u00a0</a><a class=\"note\" href=\"#content100note10sym\">[\u00a010\u00a0]</a>\nYet he strongly opposed the relocation of the children\u2019s mother to\na place where she had more family support. In other cases, the\nfathers were evidently extraordinarily dedicated to the wellbeing of\ntheir children. Of course, the accounts of each of our interviewees\nwas coloured by their own perspective. In only ten cases did we hear\nboth parents\u2019 stories. \n</p>\n<p>What\nwas clear from the research was that where children did have a close\nrelationship with the non-resident parent, a move a long distance\nfrom that parent was detrimental to the children\u2019s wellbeing.\nVideo-technology and the ease of plane travel diminished children\u2019s\nsense of loss but did not eradicate it.<a class=\"anchor\" id=\"content100note11anc\" name=\"content100note11anc\">\u00a0</a><a class=\"note\" href=\"#content100note11sym\">[\u00a011\u00a0]</a></p>\n<h2>The relationship between the first and second\norder of justice</h2>\n<p>This brings me to my\nfinal observation on Wolsterstorff\u2019s very helpful analysis. Second\norder justice is not always about rights. In the family law context,\nsecond order justice provides a decision-maker when parents cannot\nagree. The family law judge must make decisions about what is in the\nbest interests of children with little reference to rights. That it\nis a legal process at all may seem puzzling to the outside observer;\nbut sometimes there are factual issues of great significance to\ndetermine, such as the extent of domestic violence or allegations of\nchild sexual abuse. A good family law system needs to depend heavily\non appropriately qualified medical or psychology-trained experts who\ncan offer opinions on what is likely to be in the best interests of\nchildren. \n</p>\n<p>Family law judges\ndon\u2019t really seek to administer justice in parenting cases. We ask\nof them not that their decisions be just but that they be wise. The\nsecond order justice is what litigants have a \u2018right\u2019 to \u2013 a\nright to present their case to an independent decision-maker who will\ndeliver Solomonic justice (but often without the benefit of Solomon\u2019s\nwisdom). Family law thus complicates Wolferstorff\u2019s distinction\nbetween first and second order justice.</p>\n<h2>Justice, relationships and peace-making</h2>\n<p>So as a Christian,\nwhat aspect of the faith is most important to me in working in this\ndifficult area of family law? It is not Isaiah 61, pertinent as this\nis in so many other societal contexts. My role is to ask myself how\nwe can resolve these difficult family law disputes in ways that are\nmost protective of children and which reduce, as far as possible, the\nlevels of conflict between parents. \n</p>\n<p>In\nthis respect, I believe the innovation to the Australian family law\nsystem in which I have been involved that will, in the long-term,\nprove to have been most valuable, was the development of Family\nRelationship Centres across the country. These centres, fully funded\nby government, provide an early intervention strategy in the\naftermath of relationship breakdown and an alternative to resolving\nparenting issues after separation through lawyers and courts.<a class=\"anchor\" id=\"content100note12anc\" name=\"content100note12anc\">\u00a0</a><a class=\"note\" href=\"#content100note12sym\">[\u00a012\u00a0]</a>\nThey aim to help parents in a holistic way to navigate the transition\nfrom parenting together to parenting apart. The staff, at intake,\nrefer parents to the range of different services that they might need\nin the aftermath of separation and offer free, or almost free\nmediation.</p>\n<p>Yes,\nas lawyers we must pursue justice and where appropriate, seek to\nvindicate rights; but we should beware lest our thinking about\njustice be dominated by a rights paradigm. Blessed, said Jesus, are\nthe peacemakers. In his teaching in the Sermon on the Mount he urged\nus at times not to pursue our rights. \u201cIf\nanyone wants to sue you and take your shirt, hand over your coat as\nwell.\u00a0If anyone forces you to go one mile, go with them two\nmiles\u201d (Matthew 5:40-41).\u00a0Relationships\nmay matter more than rights in certain situations. Loving our enemies\nmay be better than suing them. It is not that a focus on rights,\nparticularly the rights of others, is misplaced \u2013 not at all \u2013\nbut in Jesus\u2019 teaching, justice is contextualised within a broader\nethical and relational framework.</p>\n<h2 class=\"new_page\">End Notes</h2>\n<p class=\"endnote\">\n<a class=\"note\" href=\"#content100note1anc\">[\u00a01\u00a0]</a><a class=\"anchor\" id=\"content100note1sym\" name=\"content100note1sym\">\u00a0</a>Quoted\n\tin Needham J and Ronan C, <i>The\n\tShorter Science and Civilization in China</i>\n\t(Cambridge UP, Cambridge, 1970), Ch 16. \n\t</p>\n<p class=\"endnote\">\n<a class=\"note\" href=\"#content100note2anc\">[\u00a02\u00a0]</a><a class=\"anchor\" id=\"content100note2sym\" name=\"content100note2sym\">\u00a0</a>See\n\tHaley J O, T<i>he\n\tSpirit of Japanese Law</i>\n\t(University of Georgia Press, Athens and London, 1998), pp\u00a0162\u2013167.</p>\n<p class=\"endnote\">\n<a class=\"note\" href=\"#content100note3anc\">[\u00a03\u00a0]</a><a class=\"anchor\" id=\"content100note3sym\" name=\"content100note3sym\">\u00a0</a>Kawashima\n\tT, \u201cDispute Resolution in Contemporary Japan\u201d in Taylor von\n\tMehren A (ed), <i>Law\n\tin Japan: The Legal Order in a Changing Society </i>(Harvard\n\tUP, Cambridge, 1963), p 41.</p>\n<p class=\"endnote\">\n<a class=\"note\" href=\"#content100note4anc\">[\u00a04\u00a0]</a><a class=\"anchor\" id=\"content100note4sym\" name=\"content100note4sym\">\u00a0</a>See,\n\teg, Ramseyer M J and Nakazato M,<i>\n\tJapanese Law: An Economic Approach</i>\n\t(University of Chicago Press, Chicago and London, 1999), pp 91ff;\n\tDavis J W S, <i>Dispute\n\tResolution in Japan</i>\n\t(Kluwer Law International, Den Haag, 1996), pp 124ff.</p>\n<p class=\"endnote\">\n<a class=\"note\" href=\"#content100note5anc\">[\u00a05\u00a0]</a><a class=\"anchor\" id=\"content100note5sym\" name=\"content100note5sym\">\u00a0</a>Abe\n\tM and Nottage L, \u201cJapanese Law: An Overview\u201d [2008] JPLRes 1:\n\tavailable at http://www.asianlii.org/jp/other/JPLRes/2008/1.html).</p>\n<p class=\"endnote\"><a class=\"note\" href=\"#content100note6anc\">[\u00a06\u00a0]</a><a class=\"anchor\" id=\"content100note6sym\" name=\"content100note6sym\">\u00a0</a>\n<i>AMS v AIF</i>\n\t(1999) 199\n\tCLR 160 at 208,\n\tKirby J.</p>\n<p class=\"endnote\"><a class=\"note\" href=\"#content100note7anc\">[\u00a07\u00a0]</a><a class=\"anchor\" id=\"content100note7sym\" name=\"content100note7sym\">\u00a0</a>\n\tParkinson, P, <i>Family Law and\n\tthe Indissolubility of Parenthood</i>,\n\t(New York: Cambridge UP (2011).

    "bodyText": "The content of natural science concerns itself with what is \u2014 not what ought to be. Natural science is experimental and observational. It studies the repeatable, and what appear to be the unchanging and normally inescapable principles that govern the working of the natural world. Its theoretical explanations are required to observe intellectual standards of clarity, self-consistency, logic, and mathematical rigor, some of which are common to non-science disciplines too. But natural science is founded on the authority of nature: of reproducible experiment and observation, to which theoretical speculations must ultimately conform if they are to be accepted. Moreover, science\u2019s whole approach to explanation is to set aside intentionality, and personality, instead seeking explanations in terms of efficient causes.\n\nSuperficially, then, what science finds out does not appear to demand an assessment of worth, or goodness, beyond the material and pragmatic. It is not prima-facie about human or any other personal value. And that has led to a view that its contents (though not its institutions) are free from ideological or religious bias: that its knowledge is purely detached and factual. Postmodern critiques aside, most scientists do regard science\u2019s findings as objective.\n\nThat does not mean all scientists view their discipline as lacking in wider, or perhaps even transcendent significance; nor are they necessarily unemotional; nor are aesthetic or ethical considerations excluded from their thinking or practice. But it does mean that when scientists discuss justice in their discipline they mostly focus on scientific social practice and applications, not on the content of scientific knowledge. This social perspective has become even more obvious recently as professional scientific societies have responded to critiques from minority groups about inequity and bias. Social diversity, equity and inclusion have become a major preoccupation in professional societies. And it shows up when the application of science, especially its commercial application, is seen as its main justifying rationale. The underlying ethical principles and values on which such discussions proceed come from outside science, whether scientists realize it or not. Here I want instead (or perhaps in addition) to suggest that natural science has priorities, which can reasonably be considered matters of justice, that derive from nature itself. Doing justice to nature is something both science and all of human endeavor should take as a priority.\n\nIf, as Wolterstorff says, first order justice derives from excellence (goodness, worth, dignity, praise-worthiness), are there not aspects of the natural world that possess this sort of excel- lence, and are there not important features of the very content of science that call for just recognition?\n\nThe Christian and Jewish scriptures, in countless places celebrate the natural world (e.g. Gen 1:31, Ps 8, Ps 96:1-6), its goodness, wonder, majesty, power, and beauty; and they also praise it as the ongoing gift and creation of God (Ps 65:9-13, 95:4-5, 104). Are these excellences the foundation of what constitutes justice in respect of nature? And are they perhaps even a major part of what undergirds the just practice of science?\n\nEven the most secular of scientists and science commentators are unashamed to celebrate the awesome character of the universe, the wonder and mystery of what governs quantum and sub-atomic physics, and the intricacies of the biosphere. When doing so, are they recognizing something that truly goes beyond the impersonal and pragmatic, or are they just being led by their inescapable humanity into a spurious emotionalism? Christian teaching is that the awesome character of the universe is in fact attributable to the will and wisdom of a personal Creator, and that in engaging scientifically with nature we are engaging with the excellences of a creation.\n\nAs a Christian, I see my professional science as engaging with the natural world in a way that does justice to its excellence, worth, and dignity, which is a reflection of the character of God. In doing so, I stand in a historic tradition of people of religious faith who have seen intrinsic worth in knowing and understanding the working principles of nature. Such abstract knowledge is not in conflict with a call to practicality; indeed it can be argued that Francis Bacon\u2019s call to knowledge \u201cfor the relief of man\u2019s estate\u201d was a vital stimulus to abandon purely speculative knowledge, and focus for charity\u2019s sake on reproducible experimental demonstration, which undergirds modern science. However, there is, in a society dominated by the technological application of science, a vital need to balance practical and commercial interests with the call to do justice to nature not just in the employment of technology in human society, but also in our valuing of the excellence and worth of the natural world. Thus, pure science is valuable foundationally because of the excellence, worth, dignity, and praise-worthiness of the creation, recognizable by all regardless of theology, but recognized by the faithful as a part of their spiritual understanding.\n\nSince natural science is concerned with the reproducible and unambiguous aspects of the world, its successful pursuit demands, and eventually rewards, certain practices that have a moral character. Perhaps foremost among these is truthfulness. Of all the virtues, truth is perhaps the one most explicitly attributed to Jesus (Jn 1:14 \u201cthe Word became flesh and dwelt among us, full of grace and truth\u201d, Jn 14:6 \u201cI am the way, the truth, and the life\u201d, etc.) and enjoined on Christians (1 Cor 5:8, 2 Cor 6:7, Eph 4:25, etc.) Science demands truthful observing and reporting. This is a discipline that requires a certain unselfish honesty, and echoes Biblical calls that serious Christians take seriously. Perhaps that is one reason for the very influential role played by Christians in the development of modern science. Personal discipline, important though it is, has never been sufficient on its own; and science has also institutional practices that seek to enforce truthfulness and uncover error or (self-)deception. It was once relatively straightforward for observational or experimental reports to be checked and reproduced by other natural philosophers, and for scientific discoveries to be quickly confirmed or dismissed. Moreover, when science was predominantly a pastime for enthusiastic amateurs rather than a source of wealth, the only personal benefit to be ob- tained from it was reputation. Today it is far more difficult to detect incompetence, error, or deception because of science\u2019s complexity. And the potential personal advantages are considerably more tempting. Truth has recently become more difficult to establish and less practically compelling, with regrettable consequences. In many scientific fields there is a cri- sis of reproducibility, and in virtually all of science there is a glut of unreliable and incorrect journal articles, fed by the now negligible cost of publication and dissemination. These are injustices, I suggest, not merely because of the cost, trouble, or suffering that they impose on others, but also because they fail to render to nature the truth that is its due.\n\nEnvironmental Justice is a phrase widely invoked today that seems to suggest that there is such a thing as justice toward nature. A major discussion thread that often dominates the development of what environmental justice means is equitable human sharing of natural resources. Wolterstorff has argued that this sort of \u201cdistributive justice\u201d, while important, is just one facet of first-order justice. Nevertheless he speaks almost entirely of \u201cagents\u201d (including social entities) as being the givers and receivers of justice. Beyond that, I want to propose that there is a meaningful sense in which the relationship of humans to the natural world calls us not only to do justice to our fellow humans, but also to do justice to nature. If so, then it would be too narrow a characterization to say that justice concerns rendering to other agents their right or due. Instead, unconscious or even inanimate features of creation are owed their just due. And these \u201crights\u201d might well compete with the desires or \u201crights\u201d of people or other agents. [\u00a01\u00a0]\n\nThis also is a profoundly Biblical idea, encapsulated in the Old Testament primacy of Sabbath (Deut 5:12-14) and Jubilee (Lev 25:8-22). As one of the ten commandments, ob- serving the Sabbath is certainly in part about justice toward employees and servants, and in part about acting justly toward God in worship. But it is also about rest for the land, for animals, and for nature. Rest for the land is, of course, a recognition by the religious instruction of the hebrews that an agricultural society\u2019s flourishing depends on the health of fields, which is promoted by avoiding over-utilization. But it is also a recognition of what we justly owe to the care and stewardship of creation, because of its intrinsic worth. Creation care is a duty for humans, not just for reasons of self-interest, but also for justice toward nature.\n\nWhat, as a consequence, do we owe to the study of nature? What moral and ethical priorities does science demand? And do those priorities (those \u201crights\u201d) moderate, constrain, or conflict with other rights claims?\n\nIt is perhaps obvious that, when investigating the biology of humans, ethical constraints on what is acceptable experimental practice should be enforced. It is uncontroversial to see these as a matter of justice. But the puzzles seem to me considerably more difficult when it comes to the justice of animal experiments. Do animals have rights, and if so which animals, and what rights? Beyond the animal kingdom, does the environment, the oceans, the atmosphere, the landscape, the planet have rights? Is there a question of justice in recognizing their excellence and worthiness? Is it justice that is violated by pollution, excessive consumption, or other environmental exploitation?\n\nHere is where utilitarianism most obviously falls short of providing properly grounded ethics. It can presume some value or values based on human survival or prosperity, but it cannot justify any value, worth, or dignity derived from the character of non-human nature. It can cash in the emotional or aesthetic appreciation that many people feel toward the natural world, but it cannot attribute an intrinsic value or excellence to nature, possessed independent of humans. Christian teaching does attribute high worth to humans \u2014 because God loves us. But, rightly understood, that worth does not over-ride the worth of the rest of creation, because God loves it too. Nature deserves to be valued by us humans. And science is a discipline that places high value on understanding it. Perhaps, then, justice toward nature, based on its excellence and praise-worthiness, is a compelling, and Christ-worthy, ethical priority.\n\nWhen the flourishing of humans and of nature seem to be in conflict with one another, I believe that a proper balance can be greatly facilitated by seeing both priorities as being about justice based on what is due. Natural science at its best can foster this understanding.\n\n[\u00a01\u00a0] Wolterstorff\u2019s discussion of justice does not address what seems to me a crucial difficulty in a \u201crights\u201d perspective, which is that different rights often do compete; so an absolute assertion that a right trumps other considerations is impractical.",
    "bodyHtml": "<p>The content of natural science concerns itself with what is \u2014 not what ought to be. Natural science is experimental and observational. It studies the repeatable, and what appear to be the unchanging and normally inescapable principles that govern the working of the natural world. Its theoretical explanations are required to observe intellectual standards of clarity, self-consistency, logic, and mathematical rigor, some of which are common to non-science disciplines too. But natural science is founded on the authority of nature: of reproducible experiment and observation, to which theoretical speculations must ultimately conform if they are to be accepted. Moreover, science\u2019s whole approach to explanation is to set aside intentionality, and personality, instead seeking explanations in terms of efficient causes.</p>\n<p>Superficially, then, what science finds out does not appear to demand an assessment of worth, or goodness, beyond the material and pragmatic. It is not prima-facie about human or any other personal value. And that has led to a view that its contents (though not its institutions) are free from ideological or religious bias: that its knowledge is purely detached and factual. Postmodern critiques aside, most scientists do regard science\u2019s findings as objective.</p>\n<p>That does not mean all scientists view their discipline as lacking in wider, or perhaps even transcendent significance; nor are they necessarily unemotional; nor are aesthetic or ethical considerations excluded from their thinking or practice. But it does mean that when scientists discuss justice in their discipline they mostly focus on scientific social practice and applications, not on the content of scientific knowledge. This social perspective has become even more obvious recently as professional scientific societies have responded to critiques from minority groups about inequity and bias. Social diversity, equity and inclusion have become a major preoccupation in professional societies. And it shows up when the application of science, especially its commercial application, is seen as its main justifying rationale. The underlying ethical principles and values on which such discussions proceed come from outside science, whether scientists realize it or not. Here I want instead (or perhaps in addition) to suggest that natural science has priorities, which can reasonably be considered matters of justice, that derive from nature itself. Doing justice to nature is something both science and all of human endeavor should take as a priority.</p>\n<h2>Justice in Science</h2>\n<p>If, as Wolterstorff says, first order justice derives from excellence (goodness, worth, dignity, praise-worthiness), are there not aspects of the natural world that possess this sort of excel- lence, and are there not important features of the very content of science that call for just recognition?</p>\n<p>The Christian and Jewish scriptures, in countless places celebrate the natural world (e.g. Gen 1:31, Ps 8, Ps 96:1-6), its goodness, wonder, majesty, power, and beauty; and they also praise it as the ongoing gift and creation of God (Ps 65:9-13, 95:4-5, 104). Are these excellences the foundation of what constitutes justice in respect of nature?

    "bodyText": "Public health has been defined \u201cthe art and science of preventing disease, prolonging life and promoting health through the organized efforts of society\u201d (Acheson, 1988; WHO). The term \u201cpublic health\u201d might thus concern the study of preventing disease, prolonging life and promoting health, or the actual practice of doing so through the organized efforts of society. The term can also denote the actual state of affairs concerning the health of the public, i.e. the health of a certain population. Health arises in part as a natural state through the operation of normal biological processes, but is shaped in part by access to resources that allow for the promotion and maintenance of health and to resources that allow for the restoration of health. Health itself is constitutive of well-being but also is also important instrumentally in the capacity to attain other goods and ends.\n\nConsiderations of justice within public health arise in part in the context of human subjects research, in part because various resources are advantageous in the maintenance and restoration of health, and in part because health is both intrinsically and instrumentally related to well-being. With regard to research, the Belmont Report (National Commission for the Protection of Human Subjects of Biomedical and Behavioral Research 1979) put forward justice, along with beneficence and respect for persons, as one of three ethical principles to guide human subjects research. However, perhaps more profoundly, justice is relevant within public health because of considerations of the distribution of health and health-related resources, which often, in public health contexts, fall under the rubric of \u201csocial justice\u201d. Because health is shaped in part by access to resources, and because health itself affects our capacity to attain various good and ends, and because public health involves the organized efforts of society to bring about health, public health must fundamentally be concerned with justice.\n\nAs discussed by Wolterstorff (2021), considerations of justice and of the pursuit of justice are also fundamental to the Christian faith. How might then a Christian understanding of justice overlap with, be in tension with, and potentially extend beyond understandings of justice within public health? In this essay, I will briefly consider the concept of justice as it relates to health and public health efforts, and will relate Christian teachings on justice to notions of justice and rights that are commonly held within public health. I will focus principally on the principles put forward in the World Health Organization\u2019s Constitution (WHO, 1946).\n\nWolterstorff (2021) considers various accounts of justice. His favored notion, from the Roman jurist Ulpian is that \u201cjustice is a steady and enduring will to render to each his or her due [or right].\u201d He argues against the notion of justice, found in Aristotle and elsewhere, that justice consists of the equitable or fair distribution of benefits and burdens. However, if those benefits and burdens are themselves understood as respect for rights then the two definitions are effectively equivalent (see also Aquinas 1274/1948 II.II.Q58.1; II.II.Q57.1). Understood thus, justice may pertain to a state of affairs in which each has received his or her due; an act, one which respects rights, or renders to each his or her due; a virtue, the habit of acting with a steady and enduring will to render to each his or her due; or potentially the acts or restitutions required to return to the state of affairs in which each receives his or her due after such a state of affairs has somehow been disrupted.\n\nJustice has sometimes been understood as fairness within the public health context (Daniels, 2008). If fairness is again understood as fairness or equality with respect to rights , then this may indeed be a reasonable conception. Justice with respect for health cannot involve perfect equality of health, which would be both practically unobtainable but could also lead to perverse attempts at reduction to the lowest common attainable standard (Parfitt, 1998; Kass et al., 2015). Wolterstorff (2021) relatedly comments that equity alone does not make distributions just or unjust. However, once again, if justice with respect of health is understood to concern equal respect with regard to rights, then this might be a reasonable way to conceive of justice in the public health context.\n\nThe World Health Organization (WHO) 1946 Constitution puts forward the principle that \u201cThe enjoyment of the highest attainable standard of health is one of the fundamental rights of every human being without distinction of race, religion, political belief, economic or social condition.\u201d The notion of the \u201chighest attainable standard of health\u201d may be interpreted in a way that recognizes that perfect health, and perfect equality of health, may not be attainable. What is \u201cattainable\u201d respects the constraints of nature. Moreover, what is \u201cattainable\u201d may also be understood in a way that respects the freedom of individuals to potentially act in ways that may be contrary to their health, thereby altering what is attainable. What is attainable may also be relative to the resources that are available (Hunt et al., 2015) and indeed the United Nations Committee on Economic, Social and Cultural Rights has subsequently gone some way in specifying what the right to the \u201chighest attainable standard of health\u201d might be understood, in practice, to entail (UNCESCR, 2000). However, even with these caveats, \u201chighest attainable of health [for a given individual]\u201d is a relatively high bar. The notion that the enjoyment of such a standard of health is a right is thus one that needs careful consideration.\n\nNevertheless, because of not only the intrinsic, but also the instrumental role of health in well-being, a commitment to the highest attainable standard of health for all is a laudable goal, one which the Constitution declares is \u201cbasic to the happiness, harmonious relations and security of all peoples.\u201d Health is not only a good that requires justice in its distribution, but one that has implications for justice in the distribution of other goods. The Constitution goes on to state \u201cThe health of all peoples is fundamental to the attainment of peace and security and is dependent upon the fullest co-operation of individuals and States. The achievement of any State in the promotion and protection of health is of value to all. Unequal development in different countries in the promotion of health and control of disease, especially communicable disease, is a common danger.\u201d\n\nThe Constitution further notes the importance of the \u201chealthy development of the child\u201d perhaps implicitly acknowledging the role of the family in ensuring this right to the highest attainable standard of health, and goes on to emphasize the dissemination of health-related knowledge to all people, active cooperation on the part of the public, and the responsibility of governments. The Constitution itself establishes the World Health Organization and states as its objective \u201cthe attainment by all people of the highest possible level of health.\u201d\n\nIt is not entirely clear from the Constitution itself what the grounds are for this purported right. In the terms employed by Wolterstorff, it is unclear from the Constitution whether the right to \u201cthe highest attainable standard of health\u201d is being viewed as a non-conferred human right, or is being proposed as a positive right for States to adopt, or is being put into place as a conferred right that the World Health Organization is itself establishing and taking responsibility for.\n\nAs noted by Wolterstorff, rights also entail duties or responsibilities. One interpretation as to what is being envisioned is that this right to \u201cthe highest attainable standard of health\u201d is to arise from some combination of both non-conferred and positive rights. The World Health Organization\u2019s constitution seems to recognize that the responsibility for attaining the \u201chighest attainable standard of health\u201d lies in part with the individual but also with the broader community, and communities perhaps ranging from the family, to the public health community, to the State, to the World Health Organization itself (cf. Hunt et al., 2015). Each person arguably has the natural right, barring instances of another\u2019s rights being violated, to not be intentionally harmed by other individuals. Parents have both rights and responsibilities to care for their children. A well-functioning state will arguably establish positive rights to various health-related resources. As noted above, the World Health Organization\u2019s Constitution seems to use language that effectively establishes rights conferred by agreement of the World Health Organization and member states. The combination of these might be taken then as establishing a right to the \u201chighest attainable standard of health\u201d that is itself constituted by various natural rights, positive rights, and conferred rights.\n\nHaving considered the notion of rights, let us now turn to the notion of health. How is health itself to be understood? The Constitution\u2019s first principle is in fact, \u201cHealth is a state of complete physical, mental and social well-being and not merely the absence of disease or infirmity.\u201d From a Christian standpoint, and from that of many other world religious traditions, that definition should perhaps be extended to \u201cHealth is a state of complete physical, mental, social well-being, and spiritual well-being\u201d (Larson, 1996; Cloninger et al., 2010; VanderWeele, 2017a). Understood thus, health might be conceived of as wholeness of a person , effectively synonymous with flourishing (VanderWeele, 2017b; VanderWeele et al., 2019a). This might be contrasted with a narrow conception of health involving the health of the body (VanderWeele et al., 2019b) or wholeness of the body. Both the broader and the narrower conceptions are arguably found in ordinary language.\n\nThe broader conception of health as a state of complete physical, mental, social, and spiritual well-being might be viewed within a Christian Biblical understanding as that of shalom (Wolterstorff, 2021). The complete health or wholeness of the person is life lived according to God\u2019s intent. Such a broad conception, inclusive of social well-being, arguably entails also a well-functioning community, one that is just. Justice is thus needed to help ensure a right to the highest attainable standard of health or well-being is realized, but justice (concerning health and other matters) is in fact also constitutive of the health or wholeness of person, and of his or her community, of shalom.\n\nMany of the goals and principles of the public health community are in strong alignment with Christian principles. Goals of child development, prevention of disease, promotion of physical and mental health, harmonious relations and security of all people are arguably goals shared in common by the international public health community and Christian churches. Likewise, principles such as special attention and care for those who are worst off, and respect for the freedom of people, would likewise be shared by these communities (Catholic Church, 2004). Both sets of communities are concerned with justice and there is notable overlap as to how justice is understood.\n\nNevertheless, the set of ends pursued by these communities and the relative weight or importance given to each do vary. The ends of public health organizations do not typically extend to spiritual well-being, whereas religious communities will characteristically prioritize spiritual well-being over other goods, and over physical health. Public health organizations can recognize the spiritual ends sought by religious communities, without necessarily actively advancing them, by respecting and ensuring religious liberty. Nevertheless, tensions between public health organizations and religious communities can arise when these ends of the health of the body, and of spiritual or religious well-being potentially come into conflict.\n\nAn ongoing tension within public health ethics is the extent to which individual freedoms or autonomy can be compromised for the sake of community health (Kass et al., 2015), an issue considered also further below. Justice understood as the state of affairs in which each has been rendered his or her due, or in which the rights of all have been respected, would include not only respect for a right to \u201cthe highest attainable standard of health\u201d but also all other rights, including the right to the free practice of religion.\n\nAn area of substantial tension between public health communities and traditional Christian teaching concerns abortion. The majority view within the international public health community is that individual rights for women entail \u201creproductive rights\u201d which is often understood to include access to safe abortion. The World Health Organization present position concerning abortion is that \u201cEvery individual has the right to decide freely and responsibly \u2013 without discrimination, coercion and violence \u2013 the number, spacing and timing of their children, and to have the information and means to do so, and the right to attain the highest standard of sexual and reproductive health\u2026 Access to legal, safe and comprehensive abortion care, including post-abortion care, is essential for the attainment of the highest possible level of sexual and reproductive health.\u201d (WHO, 2021).\n\nSuch an understanding of rights is in strong tension with the vast majority of the Christian tradition and teaching on abortion (May, 2008), much of which has emphasized the respect for life from the moment of conception until natural death. Under this understanding, the embryo is a human person in development and, as such, has rights, the most fundamental of which is the right to life. Such a right to life would obviously contradict the notion that reproductive rights include a right to abortion.\n\nOf course central to this dispute is who is a bearer of rights and, even more fundamentally, what is a human person? This is arguably first a metaphysical question and second an ethical question. It is not one that can be settled on scientific grounds. Most of the Christian tradition has insisted that from the time of conception, the embryo is a human person in development and the bearer of rights and thus in almost all circumstances it is wrong \u2013 unjust \u2013 to intentionally put an end to this life. This human person in development likewise has a right to the \u201cenjoyment of the highest attainable standard of health\u201d and health itself presupposes life.\n\nHowever, if both the mother and the embryo or fetus has the right to the enjoyment of the highest attainable standard of health, this itself creates responsibilities for the community \u2013 for the public health community, for the state, for the father, for friends, for the extended family. All are to work to attain the highest attainable standard of health for both the mother and the baby. Justice \u2013 respecting the rights of all \u2013 requires work to make such health possible.\n\nIn the case of abortion, tensions concerning rights and justice, potentially arise because of differing metaphysical and ethical positions concerning the notion of persons and the bearers of rights. However, other tensions concerning rights and justice arise within public health and concern individual rights, freedoms, and interests weighed against community interests. A fundamental question that arises in this regard is whether and the extent to which individual rights can be set aside or are suspended for community interests (Lappe, 1986; Kass et al. 2015).\n\nOne idea that has been put forward to navigate this question is that of \u201cproportionality\u201d (Faden and Faden, 1978): the idea that the burden posed by (particularly non-voluntary) interventions should be low and benefits high. This idea has been used to argue that incentives should be favored over disincentives, education favored over manipulative messages, and government intervention ought not occur without considerable evidence about effectiveness. While some have subsequently advocated for voluntary approaches being the only approaches acceptable, counter-arguments have been put forward that since other outside influences can encourage people to alter their preferences unknowingly, coercive measures or potentially manipulative messages are sometimes needed counter these in the interest of public health (Kass et al., 2015). Personal interconnectedness and the mutual influence that people have on one another, both in general in thought and behavior, but also concerning contagion and infectious disease, complicate these matters yet further. These issues have of course been evident in discussions of balancing individual rights with the common good in the recent Covid-19 pandemic.\n\nThese questions of course come down to questions of the rights of individuals and what is owed to individuals by the government both with regard to freedoms but also with regard to preservation of the common good. These are questions of justice. The answer to these questions are not always easy to discern, but they are central to matters of the promotion of public health and the freedom of people to pursue other goods and ends, that may themselves perhaps be viewed as constitutive of health in its broader sense.\n\nIf public health is ultimately aimed at achieving the \u201chighest attainable standard of health\u201d for all, then it is in fact not clear that a focus on justice alone will suffice. A person acts justly by acting so as to render each what is his or her due. This will inevitably entail not intentionally doing harm to another, and doing what is within one\u2019s reasonable ability to help others in one\u2019s community. Attaining health for all will require justice, both so as not to harm the well-being of others and as a constitutive part of what is entailed by the wholeness or well-being of a person and of a community. However, there is only so much an individual can do promote the \u201chighest attainable standard of health\u201d for another.\n\nAny chance of achieving this will require the action of communities and institutions. As noted above, the right to the \u201chighest attainable standard of health\u201d might be viewed as arising out of some combination of human rights, the positive rights granted by governments, and the rights conferred by institutions. However, if health is to be understood as \u201ca state of complete physical, mental and social [and spiritual] well-being,\u201d then it is not clear even just actions of individuals and well-intentioned policies and inteventions of institutions will suffice. If health includes social well-being, more than this may be needed.\n\nSocial relationships are arguably most powerfully and adequately formed out of love, out of a disposition to desire the good for the other and union with the other (Aquinas, 1274/1948, I.II.Q26.4; Stump, 2006). Likewise, from a Christian understanding, attaining spiritual well-being requires charity \u2013 a love for God \u2013 along with the presence of God\u2019s grace and love, characteristically mediated in and through the Church community. Health, understood as the wholeness of the person, requires love.\n\nLove for another will entail justice (cf. Wolterstorff, 2015). One does not properly love the other, or God, if one is not respecting the other person\u2019s rights. But love entails more than justice; it entails a disposition towards willing their good, and to be with them, resulting also in an affirmation of the goodness of their being (Pieper, 1974). It is what almost all persons seek; it is the fabric of social well-being. It is the foundation of spiritual well-being. It is for this reason that the New Testament and Christian teaching put love \u2013 love of God and love of neighbor \u2013 at the foundation of all of the law, of all of ethics (Matt. 22:37-40; Rom. 13:9-10). The wholeness of persons requires justice, but it requires more than justice. It requires love.\n\nLove \u2013 love of neighbor and love of God \u2013 is also needed for health because it is arguably a powerful resource for physical and mental well-being as well. There is now ample empirical evidence that social relationships themselves and participation in religious community (i.e. social and spiritual well-being) profoundly contribute to both physical health and mental health (Holt-Lunstad et al., 2015; VanderWeele, 2017). Social and spiritual well-being are perhaps amongst the most powerful, but neglected, forces for attaining physical and mental health. If we are committed to trying to achieve the \u201chighest attainable standard of health\u201d for all, this will require love. It will require love because love is the foundation of social and spiritual well-being and it will require love because this also powerfully shapes physical and mental well-being also. The only way to adequately attempt to preserve and support the partially conferred right to the \u201cenjoyment of the highest attainable standard of health\u201d is to look beyond rights and beyond justice \u2013 it is to look to love. We must seek a just society \u2013 yes \u2013 but we must also seek to create a civilization of love (Catholic Church, 2004).\n\nFinally, the wholeness of persons and of communities also requires love also because we, as individuals and as communities, are in need of healing. We are in need of healing because there are injustices; there are wrongs; there are hurts. From a Christian understanding, we are in need of healing because there is sin. The administration of justice understood as the acts of punishment or restitutions required to return to the state of affairs that is just can go some way; but it does not fully heal. It alone is often not sufficient to restore a person to wholeness; it often does not heal the relationship or the community. For that we also need forgiveness, understood as the replacing of ill-will towards the offender with good-will, and thus itself a form of love (Stump, 2006). It is in such forgiveness that we are released from the offense and the offender, that healing can occur, and that relationships can, when appropriate, be restored. Forgiveness is not incompatible with justice or with punishment; one can forgive and desire the ultimate well-being of the offender, and yet still seek a just outcome. But forgiveness frees the victim, promotes his or her mental health (as now demonstrated by ample empirical evidence cf. Toussaint et al., 2015; Long et al., 2020), and opens the way for a restoration of wholeness to the individual and the community. In our fallen world, forgiveness is needed for the attainment of health and well-being, and is needed for the restoration of relationships with one another. It is part of Christian teaching that forgiveness is also what is ultimately needed for spiritual well-being, for a restored relationship with God, for a restoration to wholeness as God intended. It is a restoration mysteriously accomplished, and in accord with God\u2019s justice, through the life, death and resurrection of Jesus Christ. Our love is needed to bring about physical, mental, social and spiritual well-being. But God\u2019s love and forgiveness is also needed to bring about this complete restoration to wholeness as well. The highest attainable standard of health cannot be brought about without love.\n\nJustice is constituted by the state of affairs in which each is rendered his or her due. Justice is relevant in considerations of health both with respect to the resources that sustain health, but also with regard to health itself being instrumental in the attaining of other goods and ends. Acknowledging a right to the \u201chighest attainable standard of health\u201d involves a combination of natural rights, positive rights, and conferred rights. If health is to be understood as wholeness of the person \u2013 as a state of complete physical, mental, social, and spiritual well-being \u2013 then this will require the practice and pursuit of justice so as to avoid harm, preserve and promote health, and to create a well-functioning community. However, the end of health \u2013 understood as the wholeness of a person \u2013 requires more than justice; it requires love. Love does not neglect justice, and is compatible with justice, but it extends beyond justice to affirm the goodness of being of the other, to foster social and spiritual well-being, to enable physical and mental health, and to promote the wholeness of the person and of the community according to God\u2019s intent.\n\nAcheson, D.

    "bodyHtml": "<p>Public health has been defined \u201cthe art and science of preventing disease, prolonging life and promoting health through the organized efforts of society\u201d (Acheson, 1988; WHO). The term \u201cpublic health\u201d might thus concern the <em>study</em> of preventing disease, prolonging life and promoting health, or the actual <em>practice</em> of doing so through the organized efforts of society. The term can also denote the actual state of affairs concerning the health of the public, i.e. the health of a certain population. Health arises in part as a natural state through the operation of normal biological processes, but is shaped in part by access to resources that allow for the promotion and maintenance of health and to resources that allow for the restoration of health. Health itself is constitutive of well-being but also is also important instrumentally in the capacity to attain other goods and ends.</p>\n<p>Considerations of justice within public health arise in part in the context of human subjects research, in part because various resources are advantageous in the maintenance and restoration of health, and in part because health is both intrinsically and instrumentally related to well-being. With regard to research, the Belmont Report (National Commission for the Protection of Human Subjects of Biomedical and Behavioral Research 1979) put forward justice, along with beneficence and respect for persons, as one of three ethical principles to guide human subjects research. However, perhaps more profoundly, justice is relevant within public health because of considerations of the <em>distribution</em> of health and health-related resources, which often, in public health contexts, fall under the rubric of \u201csocial justice\u201d. Because health is shaped in part by access to resources, and because health itself affects our capacity to attain various good and ends, and because public health involves the organized efforts of society to bring about health, public health must fundamentally be concerned with justice.</p>\n<p>As discussed by Wolterstorff (2021), considerations of justice and of the pursuit of justice are also fundamental to the Christian faith. How might then a Christian understanding of justice overlap with, be in tension with, and potentially extend beyond understandings of justice within public health? In this essay, I will briefly consider the concept of justice as it relates to health and public health efforts, and will relate Christian teachings on justice to notions of justice and rights that are commonly held within public health. I will focus principally on the principles put forward in the World Health Organization\u2019s Constitution (WHO, 1946).</p>\n<h2>The Concept of Justice</h2>\n<p>Wolterstorff (2021) considers various accounts of justice. His favored notion, from the Roman jurist Ulpian is that \u201cjustice is a steady and enduring will to render to each his or her due [or right].\u201d He argues against the notion of justice, found in Aristotle and elsewhere, that justice consists of the equitable or fair distribution of benefits and burdens. However, if those benefits and burdens are themselves understood as respect for rights then the two definitions are effectively equivalent (see also Aquinas 1274/1948 II.II.Q58.1; II.II.Q57.1). Understood thus, justice may pertain to a <em>state of affairs</em> in which each has received his or her due; an act, one which respects rights, or renders to each his or her due; a virtue, the habit of acting with a steady and enduring will to render to each his or her due; or potentially the acts or restitutions required to return to the state of affairs in which each receives his or her due after such a state of affairs has somehow been disrupted.</p>\n<p>Justice has sometimes been understood as fairness within the public health context (Daniels, 2008). If fairness is again understood as fairness or equality <em>with respect to rights</em>, then this may indeed be a reasonable conception. Justice with respect for health cannot involve perfect equality of health, which would be both practically unobtainable but could also lead to perverse attempts at reduction to the lowest common attainable standard (Parfitt, 1998; Kass et al., 2015). Wolterstorff (2021) relatedly comments that equity alone does not make distributions just or unjust. However, once again, if justice with respect of health is understood to concern equal respect with regard to rights, then this might be a reasonable way to conceive of justice in the public health context.</p>\n<h2>Rights to the \u201cHighest Attainable Standard of Health\u201d</h2>\n<h3>Principles of the WHO.</h3>\n<p>The World Health Organization (WHO) 1946 Constitution puts forward the principle that \u201cThe enjoyment of the highest attainable standard of health is one of the fundamental rights of every human being without distinction of race, religion, political belief, economic or social condition.\u201d The notion of the \u201chighest attainable standard of health\u201d may be interpreted in a way that recognizes that perfect health, and perfect equality of health, may not be attainable. What is \u201cattainable\u201d respects the constraints of nature. Moreover, what is \u201cattainable\u201d may also be understood in a way that respects the freedom of individuals to potentially act in ways that may be contrary to their health, thereby altering what is attainable. What is attainable may also be relative to the resources that are available (Hunt et al., 2015) and indeed the United Nations Committee on Economic, Social and Cultural Rights has subsequently gone some way in specifying what the right to the \u201chighest attainable standard of health\u201d might be understood, in practice, to entail (UNCESCR, 2000). However, even with these caveats, \u201chighest attainable of health [for a given individual]\u201d is a relatively high bar. The notion that the enjoyment of such a standard of health is a <em>right</em> is thus one that needs careful consideration.</p>\n<h3>Intrinsic and Instrumental Goals of Health.</h3>\n<p>Nevertheless, because of not only the intrinsic, but also the instrumental role of health in well-being, a commitment to the highest attainable standard of health for all is a laudable goal, one which the Constitution declares is \u201cbasic to the happiness, harmonious relations and security of all peoples.\u201d Health is not only a good that requires justice in its distribution, but one that has implications for justice in the distribution of other goods. The Constitution goes on to state \u201cThe health of all peoples is fundamental to the attainment of peace and security and is dependent upon the fullest co-operation of individuals and States. The achievement of any State in the promotion and protection of health is of value to all. Unequal development in different countries in the promotion of health and control of disease, especially communicable disease, is a common danger.\u201d</p>\n<p>The Constitution further notes the importance of the \u201chealthy development of the child\u201d perhaps implicitly acknowledging the role of the family in ensuring this right to the highest attainable standard of health, and goes on to emphasize the dissemination of health-related knowledge to all people, active cooperation on the part of the public, and the responsibility of governments. The Constitution itself establishes the World Health Organization and states as its objective \u201cthe attainment by all people of the highest possible level of health.\u201d</p>\n<p>It is not entirely clear from the Constitution itself what the grounds are for this purported right. In the terms employed by Wolterstorff, it is unclear from the Constitution whether the right to \u201cthe highest attainable standard of health\u201d is being viewed as a non-conferred human right, or is being proposed as a positive right for States to adopt, or is being put into place as a conferred right that the World Health Organization is itself establishing and taking responsibility for.</p>\n<h3>Whose Responsibility for Rights to Health?</h3>\n<p>As noted by Wolterstorff, rights also entail duties or responsibilities. One interpretation as to what is being envisioned is that this right to \u201cthe highest attainable standard of health\u201d is to arise from some combination of both non-conferred and positive rights. The World Health Organization\u2019s constitution seems to recognize that the responsibility for attaining the \u201chighest attainable standard of health\u201d lies in part with the individual but also with the broader community, and communities perhaps ranging from the family, to the public health community, to the State, to the World Health Organization itself (cf. Hunt et al., 2015). Each person arguably has the natural right, barring instances of another\u2019s rights being violated, to not be intentionally harmed by other individuals. Parents have both rights and responsibilities to care for their children. A well-functioning state will arguably establish positive rights to various health-related resources. As noted above, the World Health Organization\u2019s Constitution seems to use language that effectively establishes rights conferred by agreement of the World Health Organization and member states. The combination of these might be taken then as establishing a right to the \u201chighest attainable standard of health\u201d that is itself constituted by various natural rights, positive rights, and conferred rights.</p>\n<h2>Health as Wholeness</h2>\n<p>Having considered the notion of rights, let us now turn to the notion of health. How is health itself to be understood? The Constitution\u2019s first principle is in fact, \u201cHealth is a state of complete physical, mental and social well-being and not merely the absence of disease or infirmity.\u201d From a Christian standpoint, and from that of many other world religious traditions, that definition should perhaps be extended to \u201cHealth is a state of complete physical, mental, social well-being, and <em>spiritual</em> well-being\u201d (Larson, 1996; Cloninger et al., 2010; VanderWeele, 2017a). Understood thus, health might be conceived of as wholeness <em>of a person</em>, effectively synonymous with flourishing (VanderWeele, 2017b; VanderWeele et al., 2019a). This might be contrasted with a narrow conception of health involving the <em>health of the body</em> (VanderWeele et al., 2019b) or wholeness of the body. Both the broader and the narrower conceptions are arguably found in ordinary language.</p>\n<p>The broader conception of health as a state of complete physical, mental, social, and spiritual well-being might be viewed within a Christian Biblical understanding as that of shalom (Wolterstorff, 2021). The complete health or wholeness of the person is life lived according to God\u2019s intent. Such a broad conception, inclusive of social well-being, arguably entails also a well-functioning community, one that is just. Justice is thus needed to help ensure a right to the highest attainable standard of health or well-being is realized, but justice (concerning health and other matters) is in fact also constitutive of the health or wholeness of person, and of his or her community, of shalom.</p>\n<h2>Shared and Divergent Goals with the Public Health Community</h2>\n<h3>Shared Goals</h3>\n<p>Many of the goals and principles of the public health community are in strong alignment with Christian principles. Goals of child development, prevention of disease, promotion of physical and mental health, harmonious relations and security of all people are arguably goals shared in common by the international public health community and Christian churches. Likewise, principles such as special attention and care for those who are worst off, and respect for the freedom of people, would likewise be shared by these communities (Catholic Church, 2004). Both sets of communities are concerned with justice and there is notable overlap as to how justice is understood.</p>\n<h3>Divergent Goals</h3>\n<p>Nevertheless, the set of ends pursued by these communities and the relative weight or importance given to each do vary. The ends of public health organizations do not typically extend to spiritual well-being, whereas religious communities will characteristically prioritize spiritual well-being over other goods, and over physical health. Public health organizations can recognize the spiritual ends sought by religious communities, without necessarily actively advancing them, by respecting and ensuring religious liberty. Nevertheless, tensions between public health organizations and religious communities can arise when these ends of the health of the body, and of spiritual or religious well-being potentially come into conflict.</p>\n<p>An ongoing tension within public health ethics is the extent to which individual freedoms or autonomy can be compromised for the sake of community health (Kass et al., 2015), an issue considered also further below. Justice understood as the state of affairs in which each has been rendered his or her due, or in which the rights of all have been respected, would include not only respect for a right to \u201cthe highest attainable standard of health\u201d but also all other rights, including the right to the free practice of religion.</p>\n<h2>Bearers of Rights and Christian Tensions within Public Health</h2>\n<p>An area of substantial tension between public health communities and traditional Christian teaching concerns abortion. The majority view within the international public health community is that individual rights for women entail \u201creproductive rights\u201d which is often understood to include access to safe abortion. The World Health Organization present position concerning abortion is that \u201cEvery individual has the right to decide freely and responsibly \u2013 without discrimination, coercion and violence \u2013 the number, spacing and timing of their children, and to have the information and means to do so, and the right to attain the highest standard of sexual and reproductive health\u2026 Access to legal, safe and comprehensive abortion care, including post-abortion care, is essential for the attainment of the highest possible level of sexual and reproductive health.\u201d (WHO, 2021).</p>\n<p>Such an understanding of rights is in strong tension with the vast majority of the Christian tradition and teaching on abortion (May, 2008), much of which has emphasized the respect for life from the moment of conception until natural death. Under this understanding, the embryo is a human person in development and, as such, has rights, the most fundamental of which is the right to life. Such a right to life would obviously contradict the notion that reproductive rights include a right to abortion.</p>\n<p>Of course central to this dispute is who is a bearer of rights and, even more fundamentally, what is a human person? This is arguably first a metaphysical question and second an ethical question. It is not one that can be settled on scientific grounds. Most of the Christian tradition has insisted that from the time of conception, the embryo is a human person in development and the bearer of rights and thus in almost all circumstances it is wrong \u2013 unjust \u2013 to intentionally put an end to this life. This human person in development likewise has a right to the \u201cenjoyment of the highest attainable standard of health\u201d and health itself presupposes life.</p>\n<p>However, if both the mother and the embryo or fetus has the right to the enjoyment of the highest attainable standard of health, this itself creates responsibilities for the community \u2013 for the public health community, for the state, for the father, for friends, for the extended family. All are to work to attain the highest attainable standard of health for both the mother and the baby. Justice \u2013 respecting the rights of all \u2013 requires work to make such health possible.</p>\n<h2>Individual Rights versus the Common Good in Public Health</h2>\n<p>In the case of abortion, tensions concerning rights and justice, potentially arise because of differing metaphysical and ethical positions concerning the notion of persons and the bearers of rights. However, other tensions concerning rights and justice arise within public health and concern individual rights, freedoms, and interests weighed against community interests. A fundamental question that arises in this regard is whether and the extent to which individual rights can be set aside or are suspended for community interests (Lappe, 1986; Kass et al. 2015).</p>\n<p>One idea that has been put forward to navigate this question is that of \u201cproportionality\u201d (Faden and Faden, 1978): the idea that the burden posed by (particularly non-voluntary) interventions should be low and benefits high. This idea has been used to argue that incentives should be favored over disincentives, education favored over manipulative messages, and government intervention ought not occur without considerable evidence about effectiveness. While some have subsequently advocated for voluntary approaches being the only approaches acceptable, counter-arguments have been put forward that since other outside influences can encourage people to alter their preferences unknowingly, coercive measures or potentially manipulative messages are sometimes needed counter these in the interest of public health (Kass et al., 2015). Personal interconnectedness and the mutual influence that people have on one another, both in general in thought and behavior, but also concerning contagion and infectious disease, complicate these matters yet further. These issues have of course been evident in discussions of balancing individual rights with the common good in the recent Covid-19 pandemic.</p>\n<p>These questions of course come down to questions of the rights of individuals and what is owed to individuals by the government both with regard to freedoms but also with regard to preservation of the common good. These are questions of justice. The answer to these questions are not always easy to discern, but they are central to matters of the promotion of public health and the freedom of people to pursue other goods and ends, that may themselves perhaps be viewed as constitutive of health in its broader sense.</p>\n<h2>Love and Justice in Public Health</h2>\n<h3><strong>Justice Alone will not Suffice</strong></h3>\n<p>If public health is ultimately aimed at achieving the \u201chighest attainable standard of health\u201d for all, then it is in fact not clear that a focus on justice alone will suffice. A person acts justly by acting so as to render each what is his or her due. This will inevitably entail not intentionally doing harm to another, and doing what is within one\u2019s reasonable ability to help others in one\u2019s community. Attaining health for all will require justice, both so as not to harm the well-being of others and as a constitutive part of what is entailed by the wholeness or well-being of a person and of a community. However, there is only so much an individual can do promote the \u201chighest attainable standard of health\u201d for another.</p>\n<p>Any chance of achieving this will require the action of communities and institutions. As noted above, the right to the \u201chighest attainable standard of health\u201d might be viewed as arising out of some combination of human rights, the positive rights granted by governments, and the rights conferred by institutions. However, if health is to be understood as \u201ca state of complete physical, mental and social [and spiritual] well-being,\u201d then it is not clear even just actions of individuals and well-intentioned policies and inteventions of institutions will suffice. If health includes social well-being, more than this may be needed.</p>\n<h3>Health and Wholeness Require Love</h3>\n<p>Social relationships are arguably most powerfully and adequately formed out of love, out of a disposition to desire the good for the other and union with the other (Aquinas, 1274/1948, I.II.Q26.4; Stump, 2006). Likewise, from a Christian understanding, attaining spiritual well-being requires charity \u2013 a love for God \u2013 along with the presence of God\u2019s grace and love, characteristically mediated in and through the Church community. Health, understood as the wholeness of the person, requires love.</p>\n<p>Love for another will entail justice (cf. Wolterstorff, 2015). One does not properly love the other, or God, if one is not respecting the other person\u2019s rights. But love entails more than justice; it entails a disposition towards willing their good, and to be with them, resulting also in an affirmation of the goodness of their being (Pieper, 1974). It is what almost all persons seek; it is the fabric of social well-being. It is the foundation of spiritual well-being. It is for this reason that the New Testament and Christian teaching put love \u2013 love of God and love of neighbor \u2013 at the foundation of all of the law, of all of ethics (Matt. 22:37-40; Rom. 13:9-10). The wholeness of persons requires justice, but it requires more than justice. It requires love.</p>\n<h3>Relationships Profoundly Contribute to Health</h3>\n<p>Love \u2013 love of neighbor and love of God \u2013 is also needed for health because it is arguably a powerful resource for physical and mental well-being as well. There is now ample empirical evidence that social relationships themselves and participation in religious community (i.e. social and spiritual well-being) profoundly contribute to both physical health and mental health (Holt-Lunstad et al., 2015; VanderWeele, 2017). Social and spiritual well-being are perhaps amongst the most powerful, but neglected, forces for attaining physical and mental health. If we are committed to trying to achieve the \u201chighest attainable standard of health\u201d for all, this will require love. It will require love because love is the foundation of social and spiritual well-being and it will require love because this also powerfully shapes physical and mental well-being also. The only way to adequately attempt to preserve and support the partially conferred right to the \u201cenjoyment of the highest attainable standard of health\u201d is to look beyond rights and beyond justice \u2013 it is to look to love. We must seek a just society \u2013 yes \u2013 but we must also seek to create a civilization of love (Catholic Church, 2004).</p>\n<h3>Wholeness Requires Healing from Injustice</h3>\n<p>Finally, the wholeness of persons and of communities also requires love also because we, as individuals and as communities, are in need of healing. We are in need of healing because there are injustices; there are wrongs; there are hurts. From a Christian understanding, we are in need of healing because there is sin. The administration of justice understood as the acts of punishment or restitutions required to return to the state of affairs that is just can go some way; but it does not fully heal. It alone is often not sufficient to restore a person to wholeness; it often does not heal the relationship or the community. For that we also need forgiveness, understood as the replacing of ill-will towards the offender with good-will, and thus itself a form of love (Stump, 2006). It is in such forgiveness that we are released from the offense and the offender, that healing can occur, and that relationships can, when appropriate, be restored. Forgiveness is not incompatible with justice or with punishment; one can forgive and desire the ultimate well-being of the offender, and yet still seek a just outcome. But forgiveness frees the victim, promotes his or her mental health (as now demonstrated by ample empirical evidence cf. Toussaint et al., 2015; Long et al., 2020), and opens the way for a restoration of wholeness to the individual and the community. In our fallen world, forgiveness is needed for the attainment of health and well-being, and is needed for the restoration of relationships with one another. It is part of Christian teaching that forgiveness is also what is ultimately needed for spiritual well-being, for a restored relationship with God, for a restoration to wholeness as God intended. It is a restoration mysteriously accomplished, and in accord with God\u2019s justice, through the life, death and resurrection of Jesus Christ. Our love is needed to bring about physical, mental, social and spiritual well-being. But God\u2019s love and forgiveness is also needed to bring about this complete restoration to wholeness as well. The highest attainable standard of health cannot be brought about without love.</p>\n<h2>Summary: The End of Health Requires Justice and Love</h2>\n<p>Justice is constituted by the state of affairs in which each is rendered his or her due. Justice is relevant in considerations of health both with respect to the resources that sustain health, but also with regard to health itself being instrumental in the attaining of other goods and ends. Acknowledging a right to the \u201chighest attainable standard of health\u201d involves a combination of natural rights, positive rights, and conferred rights. If health is to be understood as wholeness of the person \u2013 as a state of complete physical, mental, social, and spiritual well-being \u2013 then this will require the practice and pursuit of justice so as to avoid harm, preserve and promote health, and to create a well-functioning community. However, the end of health \u2013 understood as the wholeness of a person \u2013 requires more than justice; it requires love. Love does not neglect justice, and is compatible with justice, but it extends beyond justice to affirm the goodness of being of the other, to foster social and spiritual well-being, to enable physical and mental health, and to promote the wholeness of the person and of the community according to God\u2019s intent.</p>\n<h2 class=\"new_page\">References</h2>\n<p class=\"reference\">Acheson, D.

    "bodyText": "Prof. Wolterstorff uses the term \u2018first-order justice\u2019 to describe \u2018the type of justice that consists of agents acting justly in their ordinary affairs\u2019, including (but not restricted to) \u2018justice in the distribution of benefits and/or burdens\u2019 (p. 7). As I understand it, this conception of just action is deeply rooted in a vision of a just social order \u2013 a world in which human beings are treated fairly and in which their rights are respected by other individuals and social entities. First-order justice, in this sense, \u2018is structurally basic\u2019, whereas second-order justice is designed to redress violations of it. Public policy, Prof. Wolterstorff suggests, can be directed both towards the achievement of \u2018first-order justice among individuals and social entities\u2019 and to the development of \u2018laws and procedures\u2019 which ensure that punishment and restitution are carried out consistently and fairly (p. 7). Prof. Wolterstorff\u2019s conception of second-order justice is primarily a judicial one, exemplified by \u2018police, court proceedings, punishment, prisons, and the like\u2019 (p. 7). However, he is clear that second-order justice can be restorative as well as punitive , and I think the concept might productively be extended to the forms of compensation, restitution, and redistribution which the state carries out in the economic sphere.\n\nThough I am not a biblical scholar, it seems to me that the vision of economic justice which the Old Testament gives us is set out primarily in first-order terms. The Mosaic Law provides for economic security through the distribution of the land, underpinned by the principle of the Jubilee, which acts as a safeguard against both excessive concentration of agricultural property and permanent alienation from economic resources (Leviticus 25). The prophet Micah, too, relates economic security to property ownership, looking to a time when \u2018everyone will sit under their own vine and under their own fig tree, and no one will make them afraid\u2019 (Micah 4:4). At the same time, the provision for gleaning, which gives \u2018the poor and the sojourner\u2019 an implicit right to food (Leviticus 19: 9-10), shows a frank recognition that not everyone will enjoy such material security. Throughout the Bible, the people of God are also enjoined to be just, impartial, and generous in their economic relations, particularly towards those in need. In other words, economic justice is to be achieved both through the structure of the social order and through a distinctive social ethic, grounded in respect for other human beings and a recognition of one\u2019s own dependence on God.\n\nThe agrarian subsistence economy of ancient Israel is, of course, a world away from the highly globalized, industrialized, and financialized economy of modern western states. Well into the modern era, however, I think it is fair to say that economic rights have been conceptualized in concrete terms which would not have been wholly unfamiliar to the biblical writers. Land reform has been a perennial subject of political debate, and remains so in many parts of the world; even in the UK, it is barely a century since David Lloyd George\u2019s plans for land taxation provoked a constitutional stand-off with the House of Lords, and during the ensuing 1910 elections Liberal meetings resounded with the Land Song (\u2018God gave the land to the people\u2019). Likewise, cheap food was a major theme of British politics right up to the 1970s, held up as one of the main benefits of free trade (as Frank Trentmann has shown in Free Trade Nation (2008)) and allegedly imperiled by the UK\u2019s entry into the European Economic Community. [\u00a01\u00a0] The notion of \u2018a fair day\u2019s wage for a fair day\u2019s work\u2019 was central to trade union activity, often equated (in a male-breadwinner era) with a \u2018family wage\u2019 \u2013 an income sufficient to support a man, his wife, and three children. Notions of a \u2018just wage\u2019 and a \u2018just price\u2019 structured what E.P. Thompson called a \u2018moral economy\u2019, rooted in everyday custom and practice but often also reflected in government policy. [\u00a02\u00a0] Catholic social theorists and economists (such as Michael Fogarty in Britain) were particularly active in translating these concepts of economic justice into an industrial context. [\u00a03\u00a0]\n\nUntil the middle of the twentieth century, then, economic rights were largely understood in academic as well as popular discourse in terms of a specific set of human needs: food, fuel, housing, clothing, education, and health care. Access to these goods could be guaranteed either directly or by ensuring that citizens had sufficient resources to pay for them. Indeed, the expansion of social provision and trade union rights in the UK and other western democracies during the first half of the twentieth century was strongly informed by this line of thinking. Governments sought to make the real economy \u2018fair\u2019 in a way that their citizens understood through policies such as price subsidies, rent controls, centralized systems of wage bargaining, and direct forms of social provision such as council housing.\n\nSince the Second World War, however, this \u2018first-order approach\u2019 to achieving economic justice has been steadily eroded by the influence of neoclassical welfare economics and the growth of increasingly abstract conceptions of poverty and inequality. Post-war liberal thinkers have generally held that collective provision of goods and services is economically inefficient and morally paternalistic (except in specific fields such as health and education) and that cash transfers are therefore preferable. [\u00a04\u00a0] With the onset of deindustrialization since the 1960s and 70s, governments\u2019 ability to meet expectations of \u2018fair work\u2019 \u2013 particularly for male manual workers \u2013 have also waned. As a result, social policy has increasingly been structured by a logic of compensation in which cash transfers bridge the gap between what citizens or policy-makers think is \u2018fair\u2019 and what the market economy delivers. [\u00a05\u00a0] John Kay has characterized this approach as \u2018redistributive market liberalism\u2019, and I have suggested in my book Transfer State (Oxford, 2019) that it explains much of the popularity of proposals for a Negative Income Tax or Universal Basic Income, which would provide a guaranteed minimum income for the whole population. [\u00a06\u00a0] The parallels with Rawlsian conceptions of distributive justice \u2013 focussed on establishing what degree of inequality can be ethically justified \u2013 are, I think, quite clear. [\u00a07\u00a0]\n\nThe practical implications are perhaps best illustrated by the way the Blair government framed its child poverty strategy in the early 2000s. Child poverty was conceptualized in relative income terms (a child was \u2018poor\u2019 if he or she lived in a household whose equivalized income was less than 60 per cent of the median equivalized income), and Gordon Brown\u2019s strategy for eliminating it by 2020 revolved around an expansive system of tax credits for low- and middle-income families with children. [\u00a08\u00a0] Such policies have helped to take the edge off the sharp rise in inequality which the UK has experienced in recent decades as a result of deindustrialization and free-market economic policies. Whilst the Gini coefficient (which measures the degree of inequality in a country) for market incomes rose from 0.38 in 1975 to 0.52 in 2010, the Gini coefficient for disposable incomes rose only from 0.27 to 0.34. Despite historically high employment levels and a spate of austerity measures over the last decade, cash transfers have come to play a major role in supplementing earned income not only for the unemployed and the disabled but for many low-paid workers, especially those in households with children. [\u00a09\u00a0] The logic of the US Earned Income Tax Credit and Child Tax Credit \u2013 the latter recently, if temporarily, expanded under President Biden\u2019s American Rescue Plan \u2013 is very similar.\n\nFrom a policy perspective, the shift from a first-order to a second-order approach to economic justice makes a good deal of sense. After all, the practical record of state intervention in labour and product markets has been distinctly uneven, so if politicians can achieve their social objectives without risking heavy-handed forms of government failure, that is bound to be appealing to many policy-makers. The decoupling of economic security from paid work may also be welcome on moral and ethical grounds, since the Fordist labour-market model of the mid-twentieth-century was premised on a male-breadwinner family structure and tended to reinforce gendered patterns of dependency within the household. Finally, we might welcome the fact that cash transfers expand citizens\u2019 autonomy and choice, whilst insisting that a Christian conception of moral agency will always entail much more than control over private consumption.\n\nA strong current of recent scholarship has argued, however, that the politics of compensation or redistribution is politically weak and is liable to face a growing legitimacy crisis. [\u00a010\u00a0] The problem is threefold:\n\nFirstly, once economic rights are untethered from the concrete goods required for subsistence (or flourishing) and from people\u2019s daily experience of making a living, they are likely to seem increasingly abstract and arbitrary: a matter of political fiat rather than the expression of a deeper moral economy.\n\nSecondly, the pattern of production, prices, and rewards produced by the market is likely to appear increasingly normal and natural \u2013 at least to its beneficiaries \u2013 since citizens cannot easily see the ways in which market outcomes are shaped by government policies.\n\nThirdly, the process of redistribution requires constant government activity: if at any point the transfer machine is turned off, the market is likely to produce quite extreme concentrations of wealth and economic power.\n\nThe practical result is that liberal and social-democratic politicians have found themselves increasingly struggling to justify and explain patterns of redistribution, especially in periods of actual or perceived fiscal crisis. This can be seen not only in the contested politics of \u2018welfare\u2019 (where the current UK government has tightened conditionality rules and encouraged tabloid attacks on perceived \u2018scroungers\u2019) but also in debates over foreign aid spending. The UN target of spending 0.7% of gross national income on overseas development assistance appears arbitrary because it is arbitrary. On the other hand, it is not easy to see how a first-order vision of global economic justice might be operationalized as a basis for public policy in the UK and other affluent countries.\n\nFirstly, is it meaningful and useful to apply the distinction between first- and second-order justice to the economic sphere in this way, or am I stretching the concept too far? (Perhaps I am.)\n\nSecondly, is there any theological reason for Christians to prefer policies which seek to achieve economic justice by acting directly on the real economy rather than by the \u2018second-order\u2019 means of redistributive transfers, or is this choice simply a matter of economic judgment and political strategy?\n\nPeter Sloman, Transfer State: The Idea of a Guaranteed Income and the Politics of Redistribution in Modern Britain (Oxford, 2019), explores how attitudes to redistribution have changed in Britain over the last century and how these ideas have shaped policy responses to poverty and inequality.\n\nMalcolm Torry, Citizen\u2019s Basic Income: A Christian Social Policy (2016), develops a Christian case for a Universal Basic Income.\n\nTim Rogan, The Moral Economists: R.H. Tawney, Karl Polanyi, E.P. Thompson, and the Critique of Capitalism (Princeton, 2017) examines how moral and ethical concerns permeated twentieth-century critiques of capitalism.\n\nJim Tomlinson, \u2018Distributional politics: The search for equality in Britain since the First World War\u2019, in Pat Hudson and Keith Tribe (eds.), The Contradictions of Capital in the Twenty-First Century (Newcastle-upon-Tyne, 2016), offers a lively analysis of approaches to equality in UK public policy.\n\n[\u00a01\u00a0] Frank Trentmann, Free Trade Nation: Commerce, Consumption and Civil Society in Modern Britain (Oxford, 2008); Robert Saunders, Yes to Europe! The 1975 Referendum and Seventies Britain (Cambridge, 2018), pp. 278-96.\n\n[\u00a02\u00a0] On this topic, see especially E.P. Thompson, \u2018The moral economy of the English crowd in the eighteenth century\u2019, Past & Present , 50 (1971), and Jim Tomlinson, \u2018Re-inventing the \u201cmoral economy\u201d in post-war Britain\u2019, Historical Research , 84 (2011).\n\n[\u00a03\u00a0] For Fogarty\u2019s work, see especially M.P. Fogarty, The Just Wage (1961) and Michael Fogarty, My Life and Ours (Oxford, 1999).\n\n[\u00a04\u00a0] This point is perhaps best illustrated by comparing the discussions of social policy in A.C. Pigou\u2019s The Economics of Welfare (1920) and James Meade\u2019s Planning and the Price Mechanism (1948). Pigou favoured a collectivist approach to welfare provision because he worried that cash transfers would discourage work and that parents would not know how best to spend money on their children; Meade, on the other hand, writing from the other side of the socialist calculation debate and the Second World War, was more sceptical of collective provision and more sympathetic to cash transfer schemes.\n\n[\u00a05\u00a0] The idea of compensation, of course, lies at the heart of new welfare economics in the form of the Kaldor-Hicks criterion.\n\n[\u00a06\u00a0] John Kay, \u2018Staking a moral claim\u2019, New Statesman , 11 Oct. 1996. Milton Friedman and George Stigler devised the Negative Income Tax as a way of using the income tax system to provide a targeted income supplement for families with low incomes. By contrast, a Universal Basic Income involves a universal, non-income-tested benefit paid by the state to every individual.\n\n[\u00a07\u00a0] It is true that John Rawls was primarily interested in enabling citizens to interact as social and political equals, and so was more concerned about the structure of social institutions and access to \u2018primary goods\u2019 (including civil liberties and \u2018the social bases of self-respect\u2019) than the distribution of material resources. Yet Rawls\u2019 famous \u2018difference principle\u2019 was frequently conceptualized in income terms, and in A Theory of Justice (1971) he explicitly suggested that the state should use a Negative Income Tax to establish a \u2018social minimum\u2019 outside the labour market.

    "bodyHtml": "<p>Prof. Wolterstorff uses the term \u2018first-order justice\u2019 to describe \u2018the type of justice that consists of agents acting justly in their ordinary affairs\u2019, including (but not restricted to) \u2018justice in the distribution of benefits and/or burdens\u2019 (p. 7). As I understand it, this conception of just <i>action</i> is deeply rooted in a vision of a just social <i>order</i> \u2013 a world in which human beings are treated fairly and in which their rights are respected by other individuals and social entities. First-order justice, in this sense, \u2018is structurally basic\u2019, whereas second-order justice is designed to redress violations of it. Public policy, Prof. Wolterstorff suggests, can be directed <i>both </i>towards the achievement of \u2018first-order justice among individuals and social entities\u2019 <i>and</i> to the development of \u2018laws and procedures\u2019 which ensure that punishment and restitution are carried out consistently and fairly (p. 7). Prof. Wolterstorff\u2019s conception of second-order justice is primarily a judicial one, exemplified by \u2018police, court proceedings, punishment, prisons, and the like\u2019 (p. 7). However, he is clear that second-order justice can be <i>restorative </i>as well as <i>punitive</i>, and I think<i> </i>the concept might productively be extended to the forms of compensation, restitution, and redistribution which the state carries out in the economic sphere.</p>\n<p>Though I am not a biblical scholar, it seems to me that the vision of economic justice which the Old Testament gives us is set out primarily in first-order terms. The Mosaic Law provides for economic security through the distribution of the land, underpinned by the principle of the Jubilee, which acts as a safeguard against both excessive concentration of agricultural property and permanent alienation from economic resources (Leviticus 25). The prophet Micah, too, relates economic security to property ownership, looking to a time when \u2018everyone will sit under their own vine and under their own fig tree, and no one will make them afraid\u2019 (Micah 4:4). At the same time, the provision for gleaning, which gives \u2018the poor and the sojourner\u2019 an implicit right to food (Leviticus 19: 9-10), shows a frank recognition that not everyone will enjoy such material security. Throughout the Bible, the people of God are also enjoined to be just, impartial, and generous in their economic relations, particularly towards those in need. In other words, economic justice is to be achieved <i>both </i>through the structure of the social order <i>and</i> through a distinctive social ethic, grounded in respect for other human beings and a recognition of one\u2019s own dependence on God.</p>\n<p>The agrarian subsistence economy of ancient Israel is, of course, a world away from the highly globalized, industrialized, and financialized economy of modern western states. Well into the modern era, however, I think it is fair to say that economic rights have been conceptualized in <i>concrete</i> terms which would not have been wholly unfamiliar to the biblical writers. Land reform has been a perennial subject of political debate, and remains so in many parts of the world; even in the UK, it is barely a century since David Lloyd George\u2019s plans for land taxation provoked a constitutional stand-off with the House of Lords, and during the ensuing 1910 elections Liberal meetings resounded with the Land Song (\u2018God gave the land to the people\u2019). Likewise, cheap food was a major theme of British politics right up to the 1970s, held up as one of the main benefits of free trade (as Frank Trentmann has shown in <i>Free Trade Nation </i>(2008)) and allegedly imperiled by the UK\u2019s entry into the European Economic Community.<a class=\"anchor\" id=\"content100note1anc\" name=\"content100note1anc\">\u00a0</a><a class=\"note\" href=\"#content100note1sym\">[\u00a01\u00a0]</a> The notion of \u2018a fair day\u2019s wage for a fair day\u2019s work\u2019 was central to trade union activity, often equated (in a male-breadwinner era) with a \u2018family wage\u2019 \u2013 an income sufficient to support a man, his wife, and three children. Notions of a \u2018just wage\u2019 and a \u2018just price\u2019 structured what E.P. Thompson called a \u2018moral economy\u2019, rooted in everyday custom and practice but often also reflected in government policy.<a class=\"anchor\" id=\"content100note2anc\" name=\"content100note2anc\">\u00a0</a><a class=\"note\" href=\"#content100note2sym\">[\u00a02\u00a0]</a> Catholic social theorists and economists (such as Michael Fogarty in Britain) were particularly active in translating these concepts of economic justice into an industrial context.<a class=\"anchor\" id=\"content100note3anc\" name=\"content100note3anc\">\u00a0</a><a class=\"note\" href=\"#content100note3sym\">[\u00a03\u00a0]</a></p>\n<p>Until the middle of the twentieth century, then, economic rights were largely understood in academic as well as popular discourse in terms of a specific set of human needs: food, fuel, housing, clothing, education, and health care. Access to these goods could be guaranteed either directly or by ensuring that citizens had sufficient resources to pay for them. Indeed, the expansion of social provision and trade union rights in the UK and other western democracies during the first half of the twentieth century was strongly informed by this line of thinking. Governments sought to make the real economy \u2018fair\u2019 in a way that their citizens understood through policies such as price subsidies, rent controls, centralized systems of wage bargaining, and direct forms of social provision such as council housing.</p>\n<h2>From First-Order to Second-Order Economic Justice</h2>\n<p>Since the Second World War, however, this \u2018first-order approach\u2019 to achieving economic justice has been steadily eroded by the influence of neoclassical welfare economics and the growth of increasingly abstract conceptions of poverty and inequality. Post-war liberal thinkers have generally held that collective provision of goods and services is economically inefficient and morally paternalistic (except in specific fields such as health and education) and that cash transfers are therefore preferable.<a class=\"anchor\" id=\"content100note4anc\" name=\"content100note4anc\">\u00a0</a><a class=\"note\" href=\"#content100note4sym\">[\u00a04\u00a0]</a> With the onset of deindustrialization since the 1960s and 70s, governments\u2019 ability to meet expectations of \u2018fair work\u2019 \u2013 particularly for male manual workers \u2013 have also waned. As a result, social policy has increasingly been structured by a logic of <i>compensation </i>in which cash transfers bridge the gap between what citizens or policy-makers think is \u2018fair\u2019 and what the market economy delivers.<a class=\"anchor\" id=\"content100note5anc\" name=\"content100note5anc\">\u00a0</a><a class=\"note\" href=\"#content100note5sym\">[\u00a05\u00a0]</a> John Kay has characterized this approach as \u2018redistributive market liberalism\u2019, and I have suggested in my book <i>Transfer State </i>(Oxford, 2019) that it explains much of the popularity of proposals for a Negative Income Tax or Universal Basic Income, which would provide a guaranteed minimum income for the whole population.<a class=\"anchor\" id=\"content100note6anc\" name=\"content100note6anc\">\u00a0</a><a class=\"note\" href=\"#content100note6sym\">[\u00a06\u00a0]</a> The parallels with Rawlsian conceptions of distributive justice \u2013 focussed on establishing what degree of inequality can be ethically justified \u2013 are, I think, quite clear.<a class=\"anchor\" id=\"content100note7anc\" name=\"content100note7anc\">\u00a0</a><a class=\"note\" href=\"#content100note7sym\">[\u00a07\u00a0]</a></p>\n<p>The practical implications are perhaps best illustrated by the way the Blair government framed its child poverty strategy in the early 2000s. Child poverty was conceptualized in relative income terms (a child was \u2018poor\u2019 if he or she lived in a household whose equivalized income was less than 60 per cent of the median equivalized income), and Gordon Brown\u2019s strategy for eliminating it by 2020 revolved around an expansive system of tax credits for low- and middle-income families with children.<a class=\"anchor\" id=\"content100note8anc\" name=\"content100note8anc\">\u00a0</a><a class=\"note\" href=\"#content100note8sym\">[\u00a08\u00a0]</a> Such policies have helped to take the edge off the sharp rise in inequality which the UK has experienced in recent decades as a result of deindustrialization and free-market economic policies. Whilst the Gini coefficient (which measures the degree of inequality in a country) for <i>market</i> incomes rose from 0.38 in 1975 to 0.52 in 2010, the Gini coefficient for <i>disposable</i> incomes rose only from 0.27 to 0.34. Despite historically high employment levels and a spate of austerity measures over the last decade, cash transfers have come to play a major role in supplementing earned income not only for the unemployed and the disabled but for many low-paid workers, especially those in households with children.<a class=\"anchor\" id=\"content100note9anc\" name=\"content100note9anc\">\u00a0</a><a class=\"note\" href=\"#content100note9sym\">[\u00a09\u00a0]</a> The logic of the US Earned Income Tax Credit and Child Tax Credit \u2013 the latter recently, if temporarily, expanded under President Biden\u2019s American Rescue Plan \u2013 is very similar.</p>\n<p>From a policy perspective, the shift from a first-order to a second-order approach to economic justice makes a good deal of sense. After all, the practical record of state intervention in labour and product markets has been distinctly uneven, so if politicians can achieve their social objectives without risking heavy-handed forms of government failure, that is bound to be appealing to many policy-makers. The decoupling of economic security from paid work may also be welcome on moral and ethical grounds, since the Fordist labour-market model of the mid-twentieth-century was premised on a male-breadwinner family structure and tended to reinforce gendered patterns of dependency within the household. Finally, we might welcome the fact that cash transfers expand citizens\u2019 autonomy and choice, whilst insisting that a Christian conception of moral agency will always entail much more than control over private consumption.</p>\n<h2>Contemporary Debates and Concluding Questions</h2>\n<p>A strong current of recent scholarship has argued, however, that the politics of compensation or redistribution is politically weak and is liable to face a growing legitimacy crisis.<a class=\"anchor\" id=\"content100note10anc\" name=\"content100note10anc\">\u00a0</a><a class=\"note\" href=\"#content100note10sym\">[\u00a010\u00a0]</a> The problem is threefold:</p>\n<p>Firstly, once economic rights are untethered from the concrete goods required for subsistence (or flourishing) and from people\u2019s daily experience of making a living, they are likely to seem increasingly abstract and arbitrary: a matter of political fiat rather than the expression of a deeper moral economy.</p>\n<p>Secondly, the pattern of production, prices, and rewards produced by the market is likely to appear increasingly normal and natural \u2013 at least to its beneficiaries \u2013 since citizens cannot easily see the ways in which market outcomes are shaped by government policies.</p>\n<p>Thirdly, the process of redistribution requires constant government activity: if at any point the transfer machine is turned off, the market is likely to produce quite extreme concentrations of wealth and economic power.</p>\n<p>The practical result is that liberal and social-democratic politicians have found themselves increasingly struggling to justify and explain patterns of redistribution, especially in periods of actual or perceived fiscal crisis. This can be seen not only in the contested politics of \u2018welfare\u2019 (where the current UK government has tightened conditionality rules and encouraged tabloid attacks on perceived \u2018scroungers\u2019) but also in debates over foreign aid spending. The UN target of spending 0.7% of gross national income on overseas development assistance appears arbitrary because it is arbitrary. On the other hand, it is not easy to see how a first-order vision of global economic justice might be operationalized as a basis for public policy in the UK and other affluent countries.</p>\n<p>This paper has moved some way beyond the focus of Prof. Wolterstorff\u2019s Theology Brief in an attempt to think about how the categories he uses might be applied to contemporary issues in economic and social policy. I conclude, then, by inviting readers to consider two questions:</p>\n<p>Firstly, is it meaningful and useful to apply the distinction between first- and second-order justice to the economic sphere in this way, or am I stretching the concept too far? (Perhaps I am.)</p>\n<p>Secondly, is there any <i>theological</i> reason for Christians to prefer policies which seek to achieve economic justice by acting directly on the real economy rather than by the \u2018second-order\u2019 means of redistributive transfers, or is this choice simply a matter of economic judgment and political strategy?</p>\n<h2 class=\"new_page\">Further reading</h2>\n<p>Peter Sloman, <i>Transfer State: The Idea of a Guaranteed Income and the Politics of Redistribution in Modern Britain </i>(Oxford, 2019), explores how attitudes to redistribution have changed in Britain over the last century and how these ideas have shaped policy responses to poverty and inequality.</p>\n<p>Malcolm Torry, <i>Citizen\u2019s Basic Income: A Christian Social Policy </i>(2016), develops a Christian case for a Universal Basic Income.</p>\n<p>Tim Rogan, <i>The Moral Economists: R.H.

    "bodyText": "I approach this response to the brief through lens of my own research focus, namely the governance of human protection at the global level, and in particular current policy-oriented research on atrocity prevention and hate speech and incitement to violence. In the area of global governance of human protection in situations of conflict and atrocities, current power structures in key institutions, such as the United Nations Security Council, and in the foreign policy practices of states, have perpetuated deep structural injustices between the wealthy and powerful states, with those most vulnerable in international society. The ongoing repression of Uighur populations in China, democracy protesters in Myanmar, or Tigrayans in Ethiopia fail to garner meaningful international protection responses because the decision-making processes and structure at the global level subordinate these crises to political and material interest.\n\nThe conviction that the international community has certain obligations and a responsibility to respond to atrocities committed by states or other organized militia groups against civilian populations (\u2018first-order\u2019 injustices) operates as a mode of \u2018second-order\u2019 justice, as defined by Wolterstorff (p7). Efforts to attain justice at the international level have progressed through the creation of comprehensive international legal standards, normative doctrine and institutions to protect the world\u2019s most vulnerable from systematic abuse. Yet the inconsistent and inadequate application of these standards leads to the fundamental research problem that I address here, which relates to injustice expressed through ineffective protection outcomes for the vulnerable.\n\nFrom empirical research that I have conducted over the past few years, I have become increasingly interested in trends that I have seen emerging in the field of human protection (including laws and norms to protect civilians in situations of armed conflict and mass atrocities), namely:\n\nExamples of mechanisms for pursuing accountability at the international level are the Special Procedures and Commissions of Inquiry in the United Nations Human Rights Council to investigate and provide recommendations on allegations of systematic human rights violations. Judicial prosecution of perpetrators takes place at the international level through international criminal tribunals and courts such as the International Criminal Court or International Court of Justice, and within the domestic court system of third-party states through the application of universal jurisdiction. Prosecutions (or the threat of) are warranted to apply pressure to high-level decision-makers responsible for instigating and abetting major atrocities. However, problems that remain include:\n\nI find, therefore, that an emergent consequence of the accountability turn has been a tendency for international actors to employ the language and framework of accountability as an alternative to other modes of human protection given the ease with which political consensus can be attained on setting up such mechanisms. This serves as a pragmatic solution for mobilising international responses to major crises and gives the semblance of a response. However, this also permits the international community to default on its wider obligations to mitigate or halt violence and provide tangible protection for populations on the ground in situations where major states (the decision-makers) are unable to cooperate.\n\nI conclude, then, that there is a need to problematize the accountability turn in the governance of human protection crises to push beyond prosecutions, \u2018naming and shaming\u2019 and other forms of sanctioning/retribution of perpetrators to promote meaningful protection outcomes for vulnerable populations in the pursuit of \u2018second-order\u2019 justice. I do not question the importance of bringing powerful actors to account for the atrocities they have orchestrated; however, I question whether the tendency to substitute (rather than complement) human protection practices with accountability through judicial solutions actually leads towards \u2018just\u2019 outcomes for vulnerable populations.\n\nThe second dimension of justice that flows from this critique of retributive-oriented practices of accountability as the primary model for international responses to global injustices is reconciliation. Reconciliation refers to the restoration to a right relationship both with God, and across human relationships. [\u00a07\u00a0] Wolterstorff raises restorative justice as an alternative to retributive justice, albeit very briefly (p7). Within the peacebuilding literature, the act of reconciliation between conflicting parties is fundamental to achieving restorative justice outcomes. To this end, reconciliation is a process of making peace between parties in conflict, and to be reconciled is to be in a state of right relationship. In other words, the reconciled relationship is a just relationship, if we are to employ Wolterstorff\u2019s understanding of first order justice.\n\nThe definition of justice as \u2018rendering to each their due\u2019 or their \u2018right\u2019 (p8) is employed as the foundation for first order justice, that is then extended to more complex modes of social and institutional injustices. My own research themes necessitates a stronger emphasis on understanding how to promote reconciliation, which is more than just giving (individuals) their due based on their inherent worth/dignity but to ensure that conflicted relationships are reconciled to prevent the continuation of injustices for future generations. The emphasis I think needs to shift from meeting individual rights/dues to promoting a relational understanding of justice, justice as being in a state of right relationship . I believe this is consistent with Wolterstorff\u2019s definition of first order justice, it just moves the emphasis from individual rights over to the quality/substance of the relationship between the conflicted parties when the injustice occurred. A relational ontology of justice does not negate a rights-oriented account of justice, but situates those rights and the context for their fulfilment within the broader social context that individuals occupy.\n\nThere are practical implications for pursuing both accountability and reconciliation when responding to the injustices of mass violations of human rights that is evident in my own more policy-oriented research.\n\nI am co-chairing the Asia-Pacific Study Group of the global network Global Action Against Mass Atrocity Crimes (GAAMAC). GAAMAC is the largest global network of government, academia and civil society members that works towards the prevention of mass atrocities. Our report \u2018Mitigating Hate Speech and Incitement to Violence\u2019 has been commissioned and funded through this state-led initiative, supported by the Swiss Ministry of Foreign Affairs, it will be launched at the GAAMAC global meeting in November 2021 that will feature hate-speech as the conference theme. The meeting is sponsored by the GAAMAC steering committee and the United Nations Joint Office on the Prevention of Genocide and the Responsibility to Protect.\n\nThe report covers six countries in the Asia-Pacific region and points to systematic patterns that foster hate-speech and incitement to violence in these countries:\n\nThe theme of justice is integral to every case study and recommendations produced by this report for steering policy actors, civil society and faith communities towards just outcomes. This project illustrates the potential for Christian scholars (within a secular institution and disciplinary field or research) to interact with academic, civil society and government actors in an area of fundamental injustice in international relations that align with a biblical understanding of justice. The report draws on scholarly research with the problem of hate-speech and mass atrocities, identifies sources of first and second order injustices that produce the social context for hate speech and atrocities to thrive. These are grounded in historical grievances between ethnic and/or religious communities, often compounded by other historical injustices (such as colonialism, civil conflict, and majority-rule) for which there has been absence of meaningful accountability and reconciliation.\n\nFindings from this study point to numerous sites through which the pursuit justice is instrumental to prevent future cycles of violence, and injustice. Examples include inter-community reconciliation processes (acknowledgement of past atrocities and meaningful efforts to provide apology, reparation and peacebuilding), legal reform (such as repealing discriminatory laws, introducing new legislation to provide for greater protection of targeted groups), reforms in governance, judiciary, and security institutions that have institutionalised and perpetuated discriminatory practices and impunity for perpetrators. We also identify a significant role for religious leaders, civil society groups and the media for transforming relationships between communities that can pave the way for healing of past grievances and reconciliation.\n\nIn sum, this case study demonstrates the crucial importance of both first-order and second-order justice (often hard to separate in the area of human rights violations and atrocities that have both a direct interpersonal and structural dimension to their persistence) in Christian orientations towards social injustice writ large. The pursuit of justice not only informs/motivates this research, but processes/mechanisms of justice and accountability are the substantive empirical focus of the research. By way of conclusion here, attention to themes of justice is not just a normative choice informed by Christian values, important in its own right, but engaging with justice is a crucial entry point into research topics that are being extensively developed in the secular literature and have significant bearing on the \u2018subjects\u2019 of our research that are subjected to gross acts of injustice.\n\nDaniel Philpott, Just and Unjust Peace: An Ethic of Political Reconciliation, (New York: Oxford University Press, 2012).

    "bodyHtml": "<p>I approach this response to the brief through lens of my own research focus, namely the governance of human protection at the global level, and in particular current policy-oriented research on atrocity prevention and hate speech and incitement to violence. In the area of global governance of human protection in situations of conflict and atrocities, current power structures in key institutions, such as the United Nations Security Council, and in the foreign policy practices of states, have perpetuated deep structural injustices between the wealthy and powerful states, with those most vulnerable in international society. The ongoing repression of Uighur populations in China, democracy protesters in Myanmar, or Tigrayans in Ethiopia fail to garner meaningful international protection responses because the decision-making processes and structure at the global level subordinate these crises to political and material interest.</p>\n<p>The conviction that the international community has certain obligations and a responsibility to <em>respond to</em> atrocities committed by states or other organized militia groups against civilian populations (\u2018first-order\u2019 injustices) operates as a mode of \u2018second-order\u2019 justice, as defined by Wolterstorff (p7). Efforts to attain justice at the international level have progressed through the creation of comprehensive international legal standards, normative doctrine and institutions to protect the world\u2019s most vulnerable from systematic abuse. Yet the inconsistent and inadequate application of these standards leads to the fundamental research problem that I address here, which relates to injustice expressed through ineffective protection outcomes for the vulnerable.</p>\n<h2>Accountability</h2>\n<p>The <strong>first</strong> thematic area that I am addressing in my current research<a class=\"anchor\" id=\"content100note2anc\" name=\"content100note2anc\">\u00a0</a><a class=\"note\" href=\"#content100note2sym\">[\u00a02\u00a0]</a> related to this theology brief is <em>accountability</em> as an avenue for the pursuit of justice in international relations. There has been an \u2018accountability turn\u2019<a class=\"anchor\" id=\"content100note3anc\" name=\"content100note3anc\">\u00a0</a><a class=\"note\" href=\"#content100note3sym\">[\u00a03\u00a0]</a> in the global governance of human protection through the proliferation of judicial and institutional accountability mechanisms in recent years. These mechanisms have the objective to prevent, protect and prosecute mass violations of human rights, serving both a normative goal of enhancing global justice, and a practical purpose of deterring and providing remedy for major human rights violations and atrocities. In the current context, actors have sought to enhance justice through accountability mechanisms as a way to navigate the unique contingencies of the current global political impasse that has manifested in global political decision-making on many human protection issues.</p>\n<h3>Trends in Human Protection</h3>\n<p>From empirical research that I have conducted over the past few years, I have become increasingly interested in trends that I have seen emerging in the field of human protection (including laws and norms to protect civilians in situations of armed conflict and mass atrocities), namely:</p>\n<h3>Mechanisms for Pursuing Accountability</h3>\n<p>Examples of mechanisms for pursuing accountability at the international level are the Special Procedures and Commissions of Inquiry in the United Nations Human Rights Council to investigate and provide recommendations on allegations of systematic human rights violations. Judicial prosecution of perpetrators takes place at the international level through international criminal tribunals and courts such as the International Criminal Court or International Court of Justice, and within the domestic court system of third-party states through the application of universal jurisdiction. Prosecutions (or the threat of) are warranted to apply pressure to high-level decision-makers responsible for instigating and abetting major atrocities. However, <strong>problems</strong> <strong>that remain</strong> include:</p>\n<p>I find, therefore, that an emergent consequence of the accountability turn has been a tendency for international actors to employ the language and framework of accountability as an <em>alternative</em> to other modes of human protection given the ease with which political consensus can be attained on setting up such mechanisms. This serves as a pragmatic solution for mobilising international responses to major crises and gives the semblance of a response. However, this also permits the international community to default on its wider obligations to mitigate or halt violence and provide tangible protection for populations on the ground in situations where major states (the decision-makers) are unable to cooperate.</p>\n<h3>Problematizing the Accountability Turn</h3>\n<p>I conclude, then, that there is a need to problematize the accountability turn in the governance of human protection crises to push beyond prosecutions, \u2018naming and shaming\u2019 and other forms of sanctioning/retribution of perpetrators to promote meaningful protection outcomes for vulnerable populations in the pursuit of \u2018second-order\u2019 justice. I do not question the importance of bringing powerful actors to account for the atrocities they have orchestrated; however, I question whether the tendency to substitute (rather than complement) human protection practices with accountability through judicial solutions actually leads towards \u2018just\u2019 outcomes for vulnerable populations.</p>\n<p>Accountability is fundamental to justice, assigning blame for injustices committed in the past to pave the way for reparations and reconciliation, deterring recurrence of the violations looking into the future and reinforcing the legitimacy of relevant systems/institutions of responsibility. The United Nations Office on the Prevention of Genocide and the Responsibility to Protect claims that: \u201cAlongside other transitional justice mechanisms, prosecutions give recognition to the suffering of the victims and their families and contribute to the restoration of some of the dignity or integrity that they lost or was severely damaged.\u201d<a class=\"anchor\" id=\"content100note6anc\" name=\"content100note6anc\">\u00a0</a><a class=\"note\" href=\"#content100note6sym\">[\u00a06\u00a0]</a> Such reasoning illustrates the growing significance of the accountability paradigm for global policy making, practice and conceptualisation of global justice. The relationship between accountability and justice is a theme that merits further thinking from a Christian perspective given the centrality of reconciliation and restoration in the Gospel message. This theme was not directly addressed in the theology brief, however, the framework of justice as shalom \u2013 a broader framework of being at peace with God, in a state of reconciliation and completeness \u2013 is one avenue opened up in the theology brief (p.2) through which to further reflect on these questions.</p>\n<h2>Reconciliation and Restorative Justice</h2>\n<p>The second dimension of justice that flows from this critique of retributive-oriented practices of accountability as the primary model for international responses to global injustices is <em><strong>reconciliation.</strong></em><strong> </strong>Reconciliation refers to the restoration to a right relationship both with God, and across human relationships.<a class=\"anchor\" id=\"content100note7anc\" name=\"content100note7anc\">\u00a0</a><a class=\"note\" href=\"#content100note7sym\">[\u00a07\u00a0]</a> Wolterstorff raises restorative justice as an alternative to retributive justice, albeit very briefly (p7). Within the peacebuilding literature, the act of reconciliation between conflicting parties is fundamental to achieving restorative justice outcomes. To this end, reconciliation is a process of making peace between parties in conflict, and to be reconciled is to be in a state of right relationship. In other words, the reconciled relationship is a just relationship, if we are to employ Wolterstorff\u2019s understanding of first order justice.</p>\n<p>The definition of justice as \u2018rendering to each their due\u2019 or their \u2018right\u2019 (p8) is employed as the foundation for first order justice, that is then extended to more complex modes of social and institutional injustices. My own research themes necessitates a stronger emphasis on understanding how to promote reconciliation, which is more than just giving (individuals) their due based on their inherent worth/dignity but to ensure that conflicted relationships are reconciled to prevent the continuation of injustices for future generations. <em>The emphasis I think needs to shift from meeting individual rights/dues to promoting a relational understanding of justice, justice as being in a state of right relationship</em>. I believe this is consistent with Wolterstorff\u2019s definition of first order justice, it just moves the emphasis from individual rights over to the quality/substance of the relationship between the conflicted parties when the injustice occurred. A relational ontology of justice does not negate a rights-oriented account of justice, but situates those rights and the context for their fulfilment within the broader social context that individuals occupy.</p>\n<h2>Christian Scholarly Practice and Mass Violations of Human Rights</h2>\n<p>There are practical implications for pursuing both accountability and reconciliation when responding to the injustices of mass violations of human rights that is evident in my own more policy-oriented research.</p>\n<h3>How to Prevent Mass Atrocity Crimes</h3>\n<p>I am co-chairing the Asia-Pacific Study Group of the global network Global Action Against Mass Atrocity Crimes (GAAMAC). GAAMAC is the largest global network of government, academia and civil society members that works towards the prevention of mass atrocities. Our report \u2018Mitigating Hate Speech and Incitement to Violence\u2019 has been commissioned and funded through this state-led initiative, supported by the Swiss Ministry of Foreign Affairs, it will be launched at the GAAMAC global meeting in November 2021 that will feature hate-speech as the conference theme. The meeting is sponsored by the GAAMAC steering committee and the United Nations Joint Office on the Prevention of Genocide and the Responsibility to Protect.</p>\n<p>The report covers six countries in the Asia-Pacific region and points to systematic patterns that foster hate-speech and incitement to violence in these countries:</p>\n<p>The theme of justice is integral to every case study and recommendations produced by this report for steering policy actors, civil society and faith communities towards just outcomes. This project illustrates the potential for Christian scholars (within a secular institution and disciplinary field or research) to interact with academic, civil society and government actors in an area of fundamental injustice in international relations that align with a biblical understanding of justice. The report draws on scholarly research with the problem of hate-speech and mass atrocities, identifies sources of first and second order injustices that produce the social context for hate speech and atrocities to thrive. These are grounded in historical grievances between ethnic and/or religious communities, often compounded by other historical injustices (such as colonialism, civil conflict, and majority-rule) for which there has been absence of meaningful accountability and reconciliation.</p>\n<h3>Promising Sites for Prevention of Mass Violence and Injustice</h3>\n<p>Findings from this study point to numerous sites through which the pursuit justice is instrumental to prevent future cycles of violence, and injustice. Examples include inter-community reconciliation processes (acknowledgement of past atrocities and meaningful efforts to provide apology, reparation and peacebuilding), legal reform (such as repealing discriminatory laws, introducing new legislation to provide for greater protection of targeted groups), reforms in governance, judiciary, and security institutions that have institutionalised and perpetuated discriminatory practices and impunity for perpetrators. We also identify a significant role for religious leaders, civil society groups and the media for transforming relationships between communities that can pave the way for healing of past grievances and reconciliation.</p>\n<p>In sum, this case study demonstrates the crucial importance of both first-order and second-order justice (often hard to separate in the area of human rights violations and atrocities that have both a direct interpersonal and structural dimension to their persistence) in Christian orientations towards social injustice writ large. The pursuit of justice not only informs/motivates this research, but processes/mechanisms of justice and accountability are the substantive empirical focus of the research. By way of conclusion here, attention to themes of justice is not just a normative choice informed by Christian values, important in its own right, but engaging with justice is a crucial entry point into research topics that are being extensively developed in the secular literature and have significant bearing on the \u2018subjects\u2019 of our research that are subjected to gross acts of injustice.</p>\n<h2 class=\"new_page\">Further Reading</h2>\n<p>Daniel Philpott, Just and Unjust Peace: An Ethic of Political Reconciliation, (New York: Oxford University Press, 2012).

    "bodyText": "To set it in context, we must briefly review the main scientific and economic elements of the problem (see Hepburn 2019 and Perman et al. 2011) [\u00a01\u00a0] . We will not here make the distinction sometimes made between \u2018global warming\u2019 and \u2018climate change\u2019. The former frames the problem in terms of rising average global temperature and the latter frames the problem in terms of increasingly frequent extreme weather events, as a result of the warming. The former is more basic scientifically since warming implies extreme events, but the latter gives a more readily defensible basis for action using an insurance argument (outlined below).\n\nFirst, climate change is a good example of an economic \u2018externality\u2019, that is an economic consequence of decisions by a consumer or a producer of goods and services that is not accounted for in markets and therefore is not taken into account by the consumer or producer. If the consumer or producer uses energy derived from a fossil fuel, the result is an emission of CO2 or some other other greenhouse gas (such as methane NH4). Emissions add to the stock of greenhouse gases in the atmosphere. The effects of multiple private decisions on the stock, when compounded, have devastating effects, generating costs for everyone. The following table, from Hepburn (2019, pg. 4) outlines some of the more salient ones. It should be very evident that these effects have deeply troubling moral consequences in their effects on human flourishing.\n\nSecond, implicit in financial markets is a discounting of future events, whether good or bad. Thus a cost of $100 arising in 50 years from now, only has a current cost of approximately $23 if, for example, the interest rate is 3%. To put it succinctly, in conventional economic theory , economic actors, if motivated solely by economic rationality, should not be too bothered about costs that will be incurred by their grandchildren and great grandchildren. (This is not, unsurprisingly, a judgement with which we personally concur.) And, of course, their grandchildren may not yet be born, so they are unable to express any preferences about the future state of the world in current markets.\n\nThird, a key feature of markets is the anonymity of those involved in economic activity. Even if a future cost is fully identified and evaluated, markets do not distinguish between the impact on a rich person and on a poor person. A rise in sea level due to global warming may flood both the Mar el Lago estate in Florida and a small inhabited island in the Pacific. In the former case, it might be thought that the owner can take the financial hit, but it will be utterly catastrophic for the islanders as it will destroy their homes and livelihoods. These cannot be morally equivalent.\n\nAn insurance framework reinforces this moral point. Action on global warming can be justified even in the face of high uncertainty of future impacts. Suppose in extremis that the spectre of warming and adverse weather events in the table above had only had a 50% probability (virtually all scientists would regard this as implausibly low). Even in this case, the damages associated with these scenarios would justify paying for some insurance in the form of slowing or halting warming. When the problem is framed this way policy actions being considered and implemented by the governments of the world take on the characteristics of a moral imperative common to all forms of insurance. That is, insurance is a blessing for the under-resourced and marginalized. The well-off, such as our proverbial residents of the Mar el Lago, can insure themselves by, say, buying a property elsewhere. The islanders cannot, and instead face not only financial devastation but also the extinguishment of their culture.\n\nWhat implications for economic policy follow from these three elements? The standard economic prescription to deal with externalities is to ensure that they are priced, so that decisions taken by households and firms take them into account. In the case of climate change arising from CO2 emissions, the proposed price is either a tax on carbon that reflects the costs fully, or the requirement to purchase a \u2018right to pollute\u2019 permit from another party.\n\nThe ruling authorities are responsible for adjusting the tax rates, or the scale of the market for permits, to arrive at a sensible level of emissions. This in turn depends on the costs to society of ongoing emissions. Yet estimating these costs is a formidable challenge.\n\nEvaluate costs First, we need to evaluate the economic costs of the consequences of global warming listed above. Recall that many of these costs will be incurred in the future, maybe not before the end of this century. Moreover, the likely changes in technologies between now and then have to be considered somehow: the world is unlikely to sit back and watch the unfolding catastrophe without trying to do something about it. But we have no means of knowing what technologies may emerge. In assessing the economic impact we should also take account of where those costs fall: as noted in the previous paragraph, it might be right to weight the costs for poorer people more highly than those for rich people.\n\nFixing a discount rate Second, we need to specify an appropriate discount rate to convert future costs into current values. As noted above, the choice of discount rate has a major consequence for current values, so identifying the right value is critically important. Using current market interest rates is unlikely to be a good choice, as those rates are often manipulated by central banks as part of economic policies to stabilise the economy in the short run. Economists tend to go back to first principles in deriving a rate. They note three elements:\n\nthe phenomenon of pure time preference: people prefer \u2018jam today to jam tomorrow\u2019. Quite why that should be is much discussed, but if it is a human trait it would be hard to dismiss.\n\nit cannot be assumed that the world as we know it will still be here at the end of the 21 st Century [\u00a02\u00a0] . The threats do not arise exclusively from global warming: the list of hazards includes pandemics, pollution, nuclear catastrophe, an asteroid strike (like the one that did it for the dinosaurs), sunspot activity, and conventional warfare that disrupts agriculture on a world scale. It therefore may be appropriate to discount future costs and benefits (the technical term is \u2018hazard rate\u2019).\n\nit is noted that the experience of economies, at least in the modern era, is that incomes rise over time: the assumption is that future generations will be richer than us, and so we should be less concerned about future costs \u2013 they will be better able to bear those costs.\n\nThere is no consensus on what discount rate should emerge from these elements: the Stern Review came up with 2.2% pa, but was criticised for being too kind to future (wealthier?) generations. Other economists dismiss all this as \u2018back of the envelope\u2019 calculations, and argue for the use of market discount rates, which tend to rather higher, implicitly discounting the costs to be incurred by future generations.\n\nOne other aspect of these economic calculations is worth considering. The predictions of climate scientists are subject, not surprisingly given the complexity of the modelling, to uncertainty, expressed in the reports of the IPCC as ranges of outcomes. The question for economic analysis is how to incorporate this uncertainty in policy responses. The insight from the insurance framework suggests we should pay particular attention to extreme outcomes even if their probability is low. For example, it might be appropriate to make investments in sea defences that would guard against rises in sea level that exceed the predicted average rise. This investment in mitigation would of course be more expensive than measures to counter the average.\n\nAll this granted, many areas of government policy are subject to formidable information challenges, so there is no special problem posed by climate change. For example, think of the longstanding impacts of educational reform, and the unfathomable intergenerational consequences. Uncertainty about the future is ubiquitous, but policy makers should not let what they don\u2019t know distract them from what they do know. In this context, a key contribution of economics, rarely understood, is that whilst our discipline is powerless to arrive at a global prescription for emission reductions, the allocation of where those emission reductions should occur (which individual or firm should abate their emissions) is, in principle, solvable.\n\nThe solution? Establish a common price for emissions like CO2 either through taxes or tradeable permits. Without going into laborious technical detail, rationing pollution, or any other good, by price is often more beneficial than rationing by rules-based fiat. For example, consider two policies to halve vehicle emissions, which are known to contribute to global warming. In the first policy, all vehicles are subject to a rule that they can only be driven on odd or even calendar days, and must maintain their current mileage. Such a policy would approximately halve emissions, but the attenuation of police or ambulance numbers would be unwelcome, and even morally reprehensible. In the second policy, a price on emissions (a tax or a purchased permit) is raised sufficiently high to halve emissions. It is this scenario, and not the calendar policy, which is likely to see high value uses of fossil fuels \u2013 such as ambulance miles - preserved while low value uses \u2013 such as careless multiple trips to the supermarket \u2013 abandoned. Economists call the \u2018least cost abatement\u2019 or \u2018efficient abatement\u2019.\n\nWhat concept of justice is implicit in the approach of environmental economists? The underlying utilitarian presumption is that the costs of climate change should be assigned across generations: if, ceteris paribus, a particular economic activity will bring equal benefits to current and future generations, then the \u2018pain\u2019 should be shared between them [\u00a03\u00a0] . Note however this is a judgement that has to be made by the current generation, since future generations are not present to exercise their voice. It is far from evident that the evaluation of future generations will be the same as that of their predecessors: they have been deprived of their right to express their preferences. [\u00a04\u00a0]\n\nWhat \u2018rights\u2019 might we assign to future generations, to relate this discussion to Wolterstorff\u2019s treatment of rights as fundamental to justice. He puts it like this: \u2018All instances of first-order justice are cases of an agent rendering to another what is their right or due: all instances of first-order injustice are cases of an agent not rendering to another their right or due\u2019. In his analysis of climate change, Caney (2006) appeals to the 1972 Stockholm Declaration of the UN Conference on Human Environment: \u2018Man has the fundamental right to freedom, equality and adequate conditions of life, in an environment that permits a life of dignity and wellbeing, and he bears a solemn responsibility to protect and improve the environment for present and future generations.\u2019 If this is correct then the present generation has to render to future generations an environment that is not despoiled or irreversibly degraded. Note that discounting the future does not come into the analysis of this right and our obligation. There is no good reason for diminishing the rights of future generations just because they happen to have been born after us.\n\nIn the discussion above it was also claimed that pricing \u2018rights to pollute\u2019 through permits or taxes was a good way of deciding which units (individuals or businesses) would be the ones to reduce emissions. In this context we might comment that although rationing through price allows the continuance of many worthwhile activities, it is a crude solution. The problem is that some units (individuals or businesses) may not have the resources to pay for worthwhile emissions, so their \u2018right to pollute\u2019 cannot be exercised. This is an example of a more general problem of using prices and markets to allocate goods: an appropriate solution may be to transfer resources to those who are relatively poor.\n\nThe discussion so far has assumed an anthropocentric understanding of the moral implications of climate change. But that is only a part of the Christian understanding. No doubt humankind is given the created order to provide for human flourishing. But humankind is also enjoined (in the Genesis account) to exercise covenantal responsibility. It is God\u2019s creation, which he sees as \u2018very good\u2019; we have no right to possess it for ourselves but rather the responsibility to steward it carefully. The language of dominion (\u2018rule over\u2019) is used in the OT of the responsibility of kingship, and the ideal of kingship is that of the shepherd, who has a particular concern for the poor and disadvantaged.\n\nTo conclude, economic analysis works with a thin doctrine of the \u2018rights\u2019 of future generations. Their interests are confined to their consumption of goods and services, and even those are given lower weights because of discounting. It is morally indefensible to allow ourselves greater consumption now, and to transfer the environmental costs and consequences to our children and grandchildren who have no voice. They have as much right as we do to a world that is not irretrievably damaged. And, to employ the insurance argument one last time, although it has been the historic experience of the last two centuries that forebears are poorer than their progeny, there is always a chance this will state of affairs will not continue \u2013 an eventuality which current generations can insure against by good stewardship and greenhouse gas abatement. Most importantly, God has commanded us to care for his created order, even as we are permitted to use it for human flourishing. We have no right to despoil it.\n\nOur discussion would be incomplete if we did not address what Wolterstorff terms \u2018second order justice\u2019. Our focus so far has been on \u2018first order justice\u2019: agents (individuals, households, firms, institutions, authorities) treating others as their rights require. \u2018Second order justice\u2019 is what is needed to put right injustices that have been perpetrated when first order justice has been violated. This can involve a range of measures, but in the climate change context these might most naturally include compensation for costs inflicted on others, and action to reverse the environmental damage that has been caused.\n\nCompensation for Costs . For example, much of the accumulation of CO2 in the atmosphere is historic, arising from the Industrial Revolution in Europe and later North America. The call from many poorer countries for financial assistance to deal with the consequences of climate change should be seen as putting right that historic injustice. Moreover, if pollution permits (rights to pollute) are traded internationally as part of the solution to global warming, the weakness of price-based rationing noted above \u2013 namely that some units (here, countries) are too poor to exercise a right to pollute \u2013 can be addressed through such financial transfers.\n\nAction to Reverse . Perhaps the rich economies of the West should be required to invest heavily in carbon capture, not just to offset current emissions, but also to deal with the CO2 build up for which they were responsible. Reversing environmental damage is probably best addressed by programmes not only to preserve what remains from exploitation, but also to restore it. Deforestation is a global problem. For example, we not only need to stop destruction of tropical rain forests, but also need projects to replant wherever this is feasible. The same imperative should inform tree planting programmes around the globe. More speculatively we should perhaps think of second order justice in relation to God himself. If we have not been responsible in exercising our stewardship of his world, then Christians at least must consider what they might do to redress some of the damage they have caused in the past. Conservation and restoration should become a part of Christian discipleship, not just the calling of a few environmentally committed Christians.\n\nCaney C.

    "bodyHtml": "<p>To set it in context, we must briefly review the main scientific and economic elements of the problem (see Hepburn 2019 and Perman et al. 2011)<a class=\"anchor\" id=\"content100note1anc\" name=\"content100note1anc\">\u00a0</a><a class=\"note\" href=\"#content100note1sym\">[\u00a01\u00a0]</a>. We will not here make the distinction sometimes made between \u2018global warming\u2019 and \u2018climate change\u2019. The former frames the problem in terms of rising average global temperature and the latter frames the problem in terms of increasingly frequent extreme weather events, as a result of the warming. The former is more basic scientifically since warming implies extreme events, but the latter gives a more readily defensible basis for action using an insurance argument (outlined below).</p>\n<p>First, climate change is a good example of an economic \u2018externality\u2019, that is an economic consequence of decisions by a consumer or a producer of goods and services that is not accounted for in markets and therefore is not taken into account by the consumer or producer. If the consumer or producer uses energy derived from a fossil fuel, the result is an emission of CO2 or some other other greenhouse gas (such as methane NH4). Emissions add to the stock of greenhouse gases in the atmosphere. The effects of multiple private decisions on the stock, when compounded, have devastating effects, generating costs for everyone. The following table, from Hepburn (2019, pg. 4) outlines some of the more salient ones. It should be very evident that these effects have deeply troubling moral consequences in their effects on human flourishing.</p>\n<p>Second, implicit in financial markets is a discounting of future events, whether good or bad. Thus a cost of $100 arising in 50 years from now, only has a current cost of approximately $23 if, for example, the interest rate is 3%. To put it succinctly, in <i>conventional economic theory</i>, economic actors, if motivated <i>solely</i> by economic rationality, should not be too bothered about costs that will be incurred by their grandchildren and great grandchildren. (This is not, unsurprisingly, a judgement with which we personally concur.) And, of course, their grandchildren may not yet be born, so they are unable to express any preferences about the future state of the world in current markets.</p>\n<p>Third, a key feature of markets is the anonymity of those involved in economic activity. Even if a future cost is fully identified and evaluated, markets do not distinguish between the impact on a rich person and on a poor person. A rise in sea level due to global warming may flood both the Mar el Lago estate in Florida and a small inhabited island in the Pacific. In the former case, it might be thought that the owner can take the financial hit, but it will be utterly catastrophic for the islanders as it will destroy their homes and livelihoods. These cannot be morally equivalent.</p>\n<p>An insurance framework reinforces this moral point. Action on global warming can be justified even in the face of high uncertainty of future impacts. Suppose <i>in extremis</i> that the spectre of warming and adverse weather events in the table above had only had a 50% probability (virtually all scientists would regard this as implausibly low). Even in this case, the damages associated with these scenarios would justify paying for some insurance in the form of slowing or halting warming. When the problem is framed this way policy actions being considered and implemented by the governments of the world take on the characteristics of a moral imperative common to all forms of insurance. That is, insurance is a blessing for the under-resourced and marginalized. The well-off, such as our proverbial residents of the Mar el Lago, can insure themselves by, say, buying a property elsewhere. The islanders cannot, and instead face not only financial devastation but also the extinguishment of their culture.</p>\n<h2>Implications for Economic Policy on Climate Change</h2>\n<p>What implications for economic policy follow from these three elements? The standard economic prescription to deal with externalities is to ensure that they are priced, so that decisions taken by households and firms take them into account. In the case of climate change arising from CO2 emissions, the proposed price is either a tax on carbon that reflects the costs fully, or the requirement to purchase a \u2018right to pollute\u2019 permit from another party.</p>\n<p>The ruling authorities are responsible for adjusting the tax rates, or the scale of the market for permits, to arrive at a sensible level of emissions. This in turn depends on the costs to society of ongoing emissions. Yet estimating these costs is a formidable challenge.</p>\n<p><i>Evaluate costs </i>First, we need to evaluate the economic costs of the consequences of global warming listed above. Recall that many of these costs will be incurred in the future, maybe not before the end of this century. Moreover, the likely changes in technologies between now and then have to be considered somehow: the world is unlikely to sit back and watch the unfolding catastrophe without trying to do something about it. But we have no means of knowing what technologies may emerge. In assessing the economic impact we should also take account of where those costs fall: as noted in the previous paragraph, it might be right to weight the costs for poorer people more highly than those for rich people.</p>\n<p><i>Fixing a discount rate </i>Second, we need to specify an appropriate discount rate to convert future costs into current values. As noted above, the choice of discount rate has a major consequence for current values, so identifying the right value is critically important. Using current market interest rates is unlikely to be a good choice, as those rates are often manipulated by central banks as part of economic policies to stabilise the economy in the short run. Economists tend to go back to first principles in deriving a rate. They note three elements:</p>\n<p>the phenomenon of pure time preference: people prefer \u2018jam today to jam tomorrow\u2019. Quite why that should be is much discussed, but if it is a human trait it would be hard to dismiss.</p>\n<p>it cannot be assumed that the world as we know it will still be here at the end of the 21<sup>st</sup> Century<a class=\"anchor\" id=\"content100note2anc\" name=\"content100note2anc\">\u00a0</a><a class=\"note\" href=\"#content100note2sym\">[\u00a02\u00a0]</a>. The threats do not arise exclusively from global warming: the list of hazards includes pandemics, pollution, nuclear catastrophe, an asteroid strike (like the one that did it for the dinosaurs), sunspot activity, and conventional warfare that disrupts agriculture on a world scale. It therefore may be appropriate to discount future costs and benefits (the technical term is \u2018hazard rate\u2019).</p>\n<p>it is noted that the experience of economies, at least in the modern era, is that incomes rise over time: the assumption is that future generations will be richer than us, and so we should be less concerned about future costs \u2013 they will be better able to bear those costs.</p>\n<p>There is no consensus on what discount rate should emerge from these elements: the Stern Review came up with 2.2% pa, but was criticised for being too kind to future (wealthier?) generations. Other economists dismiss all this as \u2018back of the envelope\u2019 calculations, and argue for the use of market discount rates, which tend to rather higher, implicitly discounting the costs to be incurred by future generations.</p>\n<p>One other aspect of these economic calculations is worth considering. The predictions of climate scientists are subject, not surprisingly given the complexity of the modelling, to uncertainty, expressed in the reports of the IPCC as ranges of outcomes. The question for economic analysis is how to incorporate this uncertainty in policy responses. The insight from the insurance framework suggests we should pay particular attention to extreme outcomes even if their probability is low. For example, it might be appropriate to make investments in sea defences that would guard against rises in sea level that exceed the predicted average rise. This investment in mitigation would of course be more expensive than measures to counter the average.</p>\n<p>All this granted, many areas of government policy are subject to formidable information challenges, so there is no special problem posed by climate change. For example, think of the longstanding impacts of educational reform, and the unfathomable intergenerational consequences. Uncertainty about the future is ubiquitous, but policy makers should not let what they don\u2019t know distract them from what they do know. In this context, a key contribution of economics, rarely understood, is that whilst our discipline is powerless to arrive at a global prescription for emission reductions, <i>the allocation of where those emission reductions should occur (which individual or firm should abate their emissions) is, in principle, solvable.</i></p>\n<p>The solution? Establish a common price for emissions like CO2 either through taxes or tradeable permits. Without going into laborious technical detail, rationing pollution, or any other good, by price is often more beneficial than rationing by rules-based fiat. For example, consider two policies to halve vehicle emissions, which are known to contribute to global warming. In the first policy, all vehicles are subject to a rule that they can only be driven on odd or even calendar days, and must maintain their current mileage. Such a policy would approximately halve emissions, but the attenuation of police or ambulance numbers would be unwelcome, and even morally reprehensible. In the second policy, a price on emissions (a tax or a purchased permit) is raised sufficiently high to halve emissions. It is this scenario, and not the calendar policy, which is likely to see high value uses of fossil fuels \u2013 such as ambulance miles - preserved while low value uses \u2013 such as careless multiple trips to the supermarket \u2013 abandoned. Economists call the \u2018least cost abatement\u2019 or \u2018efficient abatement\u2019.</p>\n<h2>First-order Justice in Environmental Economics</h2>\n<p>What concept of justice is implicit in the approach of environmental economists? The underlying utilitarian presumption is that the costs of climate change should be assigned across generations: if, <i>ceteris paribus,</i> a particular economic activity will bring equal benefits to current and future generations, then the \u2018pain\u2019 should be shared between them<a class=\"anchor\" id=\"content100note3anc\" name=\"content100note3anc\">\u00a0</a><a class=\"note\" href=\"#content100note3sym\">[\u00a03\u00a0]</a>. Note however this is a judgement that has to be made by the current generation, since future generations are not present to exercise their voice. It is far from evident that the evaluation of future generations will be the same as that of their predecessors: they have been deprived of their right to express their preferences.<a class=\"anchor\" id=\"content100note4anc\" name=\"content100note4anc\">\u00a0</a><a class=\"note\" href=\"#content100note4sym\">[\u00a04\u00a0]</a></p>\n<p>What \u2018rights\u2019 might we assign to future generations, to relate this discussion to Wolterstorff\u2019s treatment of rights as fundamental to justice. He puts it like this: \u2018All instances of first-order justice are cases of an agent rendering to another what is their right or due: all instances of first-order injustice are cases of an agent not rendering to another their right or due\u2019. In his analysis of climate change, Caney (2006) appeals to the 1972 Stockholm Declaration of the UN Conference on Human Environment: \u2018Man has the fundamental right to freedom, equality and adequate conditions of life, in an environment that permits a life of dignity and wellbeing, and he bears a solemn responsibility to protect and improve the environment for present and future generations.\u2019 If this is correct then the present generation has to render to future generations an environment that is not despoiled or irreversibly degraded. Note that discounting the future does not come into the analysis of this right and our obligation. There is no good reason for diminishing the rights of future generations just because they happen to have been born after us.</p>\n<p>In the discussion above it was also claimed that pricing \u2018rights to pollute\u2019 through permits or taxes was a good way of deciding which units (individuals or businesses) would be the ones to reduce emissions. In this context we might comment that although rationing through price allows the continuance of many worthwhile activities, it is a crude solution. The problem is that some units (individuals or businesses) may not have the resources to pay for worthwhile emissions, so their \u2018right to pollute\u2019 cannot be exercised. This is an example of a more general problem of using prices and markets to allocate goods: an appropriate solution may be to transfer resources to those who are relatively poor.</p>\n<p>The discussion so far has assumed an anthropocentric understanding of the moral implications of climate change.

But humankind is also enjoined (in the Genesis account) to exercise covenantal responsibility. It is God\u2019s creation, which he sees as \u2018very good\u2019; we have no right to possess it for ourselves but rather the responsibility to steward it carefully. The language of dominion (\u2018rule over\u2019) is used in the OT of the responsibility of kingship, and the ideal of kingship is that of the shepherd, who has a particular concern for the poor and disadvantaged.</p>\n<p>To conclude, economic analysis works with a thin doctrine of the \u2018rights\u2019 of future generations.

It is morally indefensible to allow ourselves greater consumption now, and to transfer the environmental costs and consequences to our children and grandchildren who have no voice.

Most importantly, God has commanded us to care for his created order, even as we are permitted to use it for human flourishing. We have no right to despoil it.</p>\n<h2>Second-order Justice in Environmental Economics</h2>\n<p>Our discussion would be incomplete if we did not address what Wolterstorff terms \u2018second order justice\u2019.

    "bodyText": "My own historical research touches on these issues, so I want to offer a Christian reflection on how we remember the past. [\u00a01\u00a0] I will focus on the stories we tell about the history of justice and injustice, beginning with the genealogy of rights discourse, and then turning to how we remember (or forget) historic injustice.\n\nThe intellectual history of natural human rights offers a case study in why the past still matters. Both critics and champions of rights discourse fight for control of historical terrain. Each constructs an historical narrative to explain what\u2019s right or wrong with rights. As Wolterstorff observes, it has been commonplace to trace ideas of universal human rights to the secular Enlightenment encapsulated in the French Revolution\u2019s \u2018Declaration of the Rights of Man and of the Citizen\u2019 (1789). For the historian Jonathan Israel, ardent advocate of a secular humanism, human rights were a core component of the radical Enlightenment and thus of \u2018intellectual modernity\u2019. [\u00a02\u00a0] Ever since 1789, many conservative Christian thinkers have been inclined to agree, but they cite the Enlightenment and revolutionary origins of \u2018the rights of man\u2019 to delegitimise rights talk, decrying it as an individualist revolt against moral order, a rupture with the Christian past. A different story is told by the political theorist Samuel Moyn, who sees human rights discourse as a twentieth-century phenomenon with dubious ideological origins on \u2018the [post-war] Christian right, not the secular left\u2019, and as complicit with the neo-liberalism of recent times. [\u00a03\u00a0] These accounts \u2013 whether sympathetic or critical - suggest that human rights discourse is a relatively recent development.\n\nAgainst such modernist genealogies, and in line with a growing number of scholars, Wolterstorff maintains that the idea of natural (or non-conferred) rights has a long and distinguished pedigree in the Western tradition, going back beyond early modernity into medieval and even patristic thought. [\u00a04\u00a0] Not everyone who takes the long view on natural rights is an enthusiast for the concept; in a thorough recent survey, Nigel Biggar reviews medieval and early modern arguments for subjective natural rights and finds them wanting. [\u00a05\u00a0] By contrast, Wolterstorff argues that there is a coherent concept of non-conferred rights grounded in the dignity of the rights-bearer. He denies that this concept is a by-product of possessive individualism, or of liberalism and capitalism. And he contends that the recognition of rights is important: \u2018It\u2019s no accident that all the great social justice movements of the twentieth century, struggling against one or another form of systemic injustice, employed the language of rights\u2019. I would concur with this point and take it further. The language of natural rights has mattered to Christian social justice activists for a very long time, as three case studies from Anglo-American history suggest.\n\nThe Levellers wrote during the English Civil Wars of the 1640s, decades before the \u2018early Enlightenment\u2019 of Spinoza, Locke and Bayle (who in any case were themselves steeped in the Hebrew and Christian Scriptures). Yet the intellectual historian, David Wootton, has argued that the Levellers were the first movement to argue for \u2018a written constitution in order to protect the rights of citizens against the state. The first with a modern conception of which rights should be inalienable: the right to silence \u2026 and to legal representation; the right to freedom of conscience and freedom of debate; the right to equality before the law and freedom of trade; the right to vote and, when faced with tyranny, to revolution. The Levellers are thus not merely the first modern democrats, but the first to seek to construct a liberal state\u2019. [\u00a06\u00a0]\n\nIf this makes the Levellers sound thoroughly modern, their sources were often antiquated and eclectic: Greco-Roman texts, the Bible, the tradition of natural law theory, and ideas of Anglo-Saxon liberty. When it came to individual natural rights, their reasoning was theological. John Lilburne argued that because God had created man \u2018after His own image\u2019, enduing him with \u2018a rational soul\u2019: \u2018every particular and individual man and woman that ever breathed in the world since\u2019 was \u2018by nature all equal and alike in power, dignity, authority and majesty\u2019. Natural rights were grounded in human dignity which derived from the imago Dei . By invoking rights, the Levellers sought to defend the weak against the mighty. The Levellers saw defence of the marginalised as a biblical imperative. In their writings, the Bible was read as history from below, viewed from the vantage point of the vulnerable. [\u00a07\u00a0]\n\nThe Levellers drew much of their support from religious minorities like the Baptists, and there was one right above all that they sought to protect: the right to freedom of conscience and worship. Nowadays, we think of this as a global norm, embodied in the UN Declaration of Human Rights (1948): \u2018Everyone has the right to freedom of thought, conscience and religion; this right includes freedom to change his religion or belief, and freedom, either alone or in community with others and in public or private, to manifest his religion or belief in teaching, practice, worship and observance.\u2019 Yet this is a right under threat in many parts of the world, and it was rarely respected in post-Reformation Europe. If we trace how the idea of \u2018rights of conscience\u2019 emerged, we find that it developed from within the Christian tradition. Robert Wilken has argued that we can see it in Church Fathers like Tertullian, who sought to defend the early Christians against persecution by arguing that it was \u2018a privilege inherent in human nature that every person should be able to worship according to his own convictions\u2019. [\u00a08\u00a0] But when an explicit articulation of subjective natural rights emerged in later medieval thought, no one argued for a right to religious freedom. Nor did this happen among Catholics or mainstream Protestants in the sixteenth century. [\u00a09\u00a0] Instead, it was pioneered by persecuted religious minorities on the fringes of seventeenth-century Christendom before making its way from the margins to the centre, thanks in part to thinkers like Locke and Bayle. In the eighteenth century, the century of the Enlightenment, the principle of inalienable rights of conscience went mainstream. [\u00a010\u00a0]\n\nThe proponents of religious liberty reached for natural rights language to assert the dignity of personal conscience and the limits of state power. They made their case on theistic grounds. The rights of the individual were based on duties to God. Because the individual was duty-bound to worship God according to his own conscience, he could not transfer (or alienate) power over conscience to the magistrate. The kind of worship that was acceptable to God was free and un-coerced. Thus, the individual\u2019s natural duty to God generated a natural right to liberty of conscience. [\u00a011\u00a0] The radical Protestant provenance of this theory of religious liberty has generated suspicion among various critics, from conservative Roman Catholics to postcolonial theorists. For the most part, however, it has \u2018far more often been a weapon of the weak than a technology for the powerful\u2019. [\u00a012\u00a0]\n\nOur final example is antislavery activism. An organised abolitionist movement only emerged in the later eighteenth century, so one can understand why it is sometimes seen as a product of the Enlightenment. The importance of Enlightenment thought cannot be denied, but in much of Protestant Europe, Enlightenment occurred within the churches, not merely beyond or against them. Moreover, historians have always recognised that abolitionism had religious roots, especially among Quakers like Anthony Benezet, devout Anglicans like Granville Sharp and Thomas Clarkson, and black evangelicals like Olaudah Equiano and Ottobah Cugoano. We find these early abolitionists speaking of a natural right to freedom before the \u2018Declaration of the Rights of Man\u2019. For Equiano, slave traders (whether African or European) were \u2018destroyers of human rights\u2019, \u2018invaders of human rights\u2019. [\u00a013\u00a0] The slave trade was a violation of the natural right to liberty and thus a defiance of the law of God and nature. Abolitionism, in the words of the Anglican poet Hannah More, was a campaign to see \u2018human rights restored\u2019. [\u00a014\u00a0] It is not surprising that abolitionism is often regarded as the first international human movement. [\u00a015\u00a0]\n\nIn the 1790s, rights language was tarnished by association with the Jacobins and Tom Paine, and partly for that reason it was a marginal feature in the writings of Wilberforce and other establishment abolitionists. What was central to them was a doctrine of human dignity: slavery was unjust because it degraded persons. Wilberforce had a strong sense of the \u2018claims\u2019 and \u2018privileges\u2019 owed to the human person as \u2018a rational and immortal being\u2019 with \u2018moral dignity\u2019: not just food, clothing, lodging and medical care, but also \u2018personal independence\u2019 and the power to pursue one\u2019s chosen occupation or habits of life. [\u00a016\u00a0] In the writings of African American abolitionists like Frederick Douglass, this assertion of the \u2018claims\u2019 of currently enslaved persons to liberty was couched, emphatically, in the language of what Wolterstorff calls \u2018non-conferred\u2019 rights: \u2018natural rights\u2019, \u2018inalienable rights\u2019, \u2018the rights of man\u2019, \u2018human rights\u2019. Douglass thought of these as \u2018God-given rights\u2019. He also asserted women\u2019s rights on the basis of their natural equality with men: he was one of the male delegates to attend the Woman\u2019s Rights Convention at Seneca Falls in 1848, the seminal event of American feminism. [\u00a017\u00a0]\n\nWhy does this slice of intellectual history matter? It matters because both Christians and secularists are prone to forget the religious roots of human rights. Both underestimate the extent to which Christianity continued to shape Western intellectual culture during the Enlightenment and into the nineteenth and twentieth centuries. Non-Western critics are often more alert to the Christian ancestry of human rights, though they tend to tie it too closely to Western imperialism. [\u00a018\u00a0] In reality, Christian activists had long spoken the language of human rights to protect the weak from the strong. While believers could be found among the critics of these movements, it is hard to deny that the reformers were fired by a Christian moral imagination. [\u00a019\u00a0] Understanding this history might make secular citizens more aware of their debts to Christianity; it might also nudge Christians away from the temptation to be too dismissive towards liberal democracy. There are reasons to be sceptical of contemporary rights talk, which has proliferated in ways that would have startled earlier generations. Yet we should guard against an overreaction. Christians often feel like strangers in the modern world, but it is a world that believers (for better or worse) did much to create.\n\nIf debates about the genealogy of rights engage public intellectuals, disputes about historic injustice are now front-page news. [\u00a020\u00a0]\n\nHow we remember past evils has become one of the most hotly contested battlegrounds in our current culture wars.\n\nIn the wake of the Black Lives Matter movement, Britain and the United States have been confronting uncomfortable questions about historical memory. Statues of slave traders, imperialists and Confederates have been flash points. The New York Times provoked a backlash when it published the \u20181619 Report\u2019, asserting that 1619 (when the first enslaved Africans were landed in British North America) was \u2018the country\u2019s true birth date, the moment that its defining contradictions first came into the world\u2019. In response, President Trump\u2019s 1776 Commission issued a counterblast: \u2018The 1776 Report\u2019. \u2018Team 1619\u2019 urged Americans to lament the past; \u2018Team 1776\u2019 told them to celebrate it. On this too, we find Christians \u2013 even Christian academics \u2013 in rival camps. Trump\u2019s 1776 Commission initially included two senior Christian historians \u2013 Wilfred McClay and Allen Guelzo \u2013 while other Christian scholars have been highly critical of the new drive for \u2018patriotic\u2019 history. [\u00a021\u00a0]\n\nIn a recent paper on \u2018Difficult Histories\u2019, I have argued that Christian memory ought to be shaped by biblical narrative. [\u00a022\u00a0] Israel\u2019s Scripture is undoubtedly patriotic, yet as the former Chief Rabbi, the late Jonathan Sacks, observed: \u2018The Hebrew Bible is the supreme example of that rarest of phenomena, a national literature of self-criticism. Other ancient civilisations recorded their victories. The Israelites recorded their failures\u2019. [\u00a023\u00a0] Biblical narrative contrasts with the celebratory stories we prefer to tell about our national, imperial or ecclesial pasts. Biblical history is frequently dark, confronting the worst episodes in Israel\u2019s past; chauvinistic histories typically sidestep our collective moral failings. Biblical history is written from the margins, by a people exiled or colonised; national and imperial histories are written by the winners. Biblical history contains searing self-critique; we often prefer a more soothing account of the past. Biblical history is concerned with justice and oppression; Western histories have often ignored the victims, and even celebrated the perpetrators. The current reckoning with that past is overdue.\n\nAt the same time, biblical memory challenges our tendency to count ourselves among the righteous, whether as chauvinists or censors. The biblical writers had a powerful sense of the pervasiveness of human corruption. Israel and Judah can seem just as flawed as the mighty empires which oppress them. Justice must be pursued, including retributive and reparative justice, but throwing the first stone is a dangerous business. \u2018For in the same way you judge others\u2019, says Jesus, \u2018you will be judged\u2019. [\u00a024\u00a0] Everyone needs redemption.\n\nAn authentically Christian memory, shaped by biblical narrative, suggests a third way beyond our \u2018History Wars\u2019. In remembering the past, we should avoid reducing it to its worst features; equally, we should not turn a blind eye to the worst of the past. Christian scholars have a role to play in the cultivation of a less selective memory. Since we acknowledge our own need for forgiveness, we do not set ourselves up as self-righteous censors passing judgment on lesser mortals or past generations. Yet we do have a duty to counteract historical amnesia and the historical nostalgia that celebrates past triumphs but overlooks historic injustice.\n\nThe novelist Marilynne Robinson, whose own thought and writing is infused with a Christian sensibility, has wise words to say about how we view the past:\n\nI have read too much history to have any impulse to idealize the past. Great pity and very great respect are owed to all those generations who lived and died before us, not least because they, through war and plague and famine, conferred a precious heritage on us of art, language, music and thought. And they conferred as well a tremendous burden of festering hostilities, vicious inequalities, and outright crimes that we have had no great success in understanding or meliorating, that we have in fact compounded. [\u00a025\u00a0]\n\nRobinson exemplifies the bittersweet quality of Christian memory and of biblical narrative. We owe past generations \u2018great pity\u2019 and \u2018very great respect\u2019 but also moral critique. There is much in the past that is worthy of retrieval and conservation (including a tradition of Christian human rights activism), but there is much to deplore (including centuries of Christian complicity with racial slavery and segregation). Yet we ought to approach our ancestors in chastened mood, with a sharp sense of our own shortcomings. In that way, we might (as we say) \u2018do justice\u2019 to the past. And we might be better equipped, in the words of the prophet Micah, \u2018to act justly and to love mercy and to walk humbly with our God\u2019.\n\n[\u00a01\u00a0] See my book Exodus and Liberation: Deliverance Politics from John Calvin to Martin Luther King Jr. (New York: OUP, 2014), which explores the importance of the Exodus story within Anglophone political culture, from Protestant Reformers and Puritan revolutionaries to abolitionists and Civil Rights leaders.\n\n[\u00a02\u00a0] See Israel\u2019s mammoth multi-volume history of the Enlightenment beginning with Radical Enlightenment (Oxford: OUP, 2001).\n\n[\u00a03\u00a0] Samuel Moyn, Christian Human Rights (Philadelphia: University of Pennsylvania Press, 2015); Samuel Moyn, Not Enough: Human Rights in an Unequal World (Cambridge, MA: Belknap Press, 2019).\n\n[\u00a04\u00a0] See Larry Siedentop, Inventing the Individual: The Origins of Western Liberalism (London: Allen Lane, 2014); Dan Edelstein, On the Spirit of Rights (Chicago: University of Chicago Press, 2019).\n\n[\u00a05\u00a0] Nigel Biggar, What\u2019s Wrong with Rights (Oxford: OUP, 2020).\n\n[\u00a06\u00a0] David Wootton, \u2018The Levellers\u2019, in John Dunn, ed., Democracy: The Unfinished Journey (Oxford: Oxford University Press, 1992), p. 71\n\n[\u00a07\u00a0] See my brief article: \u2018State Democracy and Church democracy: The Levellers and the Bible\u2019: State_democracy_and_church_democracy.pdf (biblesociety.org.uk)\n\n[\u00a08\u00a0] Robert Louis Wilken, Liberty in the Things of God: The Christian Origins of Religious Freedom (New Haven: Yale University Press, 2019).\n\n[\u00a09\u00a0] See Brian Tierney, \u2018Religious Rights: A Historical Perspective\u2019, in Noel B.

Both critics and champions of rights discourse fight for control of historical terrain. Each constructs an historical narrative to explain what\u2019s right or wrong with rights. As Wolterstorff observes, it has been commonplace to trace ideas of universal human rights to the secular Enlightenment encapsulated in the French Revolution\u2019s \u2018Declaration of the Rights of Man and of the Citizen\u2019 (1789). For the historian Jonathan Israel, ardent advocate of a secular humanism, human rights were a core component of the radical Enlightenment and thus of \u2018intellectual modernity\u2019.<a class=\"anchor\" id=\"content100note2anc\" name=\"content100note2anc\">\u00a0</a><a class=\"note\" href=\"#content100note2sym\">[\u00a02\u00a0]</a> Ever since 1789, many conservative Christian thinkers have been inclined to agree, but they cite the Enlightenment and revolutionary origins of \u2018the rights of man\u2019 to delegitimise rights talk, decrying it as an individualist revolt against moral order, a rupture with the Christian past. A different story is told by the political theorist Samuel Moyn, who sees human rights discourse as a twentieth-century phenomenon with dubious ideological origins on \u2018the [post-war] Christian right, not the secular left\u2019, and as complicit with the neo-liberalism of recent times.<a class=\"anchor\" id=\"content100note3anc\" name=\"content100note3anc\">\u00a0</a><a class=\"note\" href=\"#content100note3sym\">[\u00a03\u00a0]</a> These accounts \u2013 whether sympathetic or critical - suggest that human rights discourse is a relatively recent development.</p>\n<p>Against such modernist genealogies, and in line with a growing number of scholars, Wolterstorff maintains that the idea of natural (or non-conferred) rights has a long and distinguished pedigree in the Western tradition, going back beyond early modernity into medieval and even patristic thought.<a class=\"anchor\" id=\"content100note4anc\" name=\"content100note4anc\">\u00a0</a><a class=\"note\" href=\"#content100note4sym\">[\u00a04\u00a0]</a> Not everyone who takes the long view on natural rights is an enthusiast for the concept; in a thorough recent survey, Nigel Biggar reviews medieval and early modern arguments for subjective natural rights and finds them wanting.<a class=\"anchor\" id=\"content100note5anc\" name=\"content100note5anc\">\u00a0</a><a class=\"note\" href=\"#content100note5sym\">[\u00a05\u00a0]</a> By contrast, Wolterstorff argues that there is a coherent concept of non-conferred rights grounded in the dignity of the rights-bearer. He denies that this concept is a by-product of possessive individualism, or of liberalism and capitalism. And he contends that the recognition of rights is important: \u2018It\u2019s no accident that all the great social justice movements of the twentieth century, struggling against one or another form of systemic injustice, employed the language of rights\u2019. I would concur with this point and take it further. The language of natural rights has mattered to Christian social justice activists for a very long time, as three case studies from Anglo-American history suggest.</p>\n<h3><i><b>The Leveller Movement and the Rights of Citizens</b></i><b>.</b></h3>\n<p>The Levellers wrote during the English Civil Wars of the 1640s, decades before the \u2018early Enlightenment\u2019 of Spinoza, Locke and Bayle (who in any case were themselves steeped in the Hebrew and Christian Scriptures). Yet the intellectual historian, David Wootton, has argued that the Levellers were the first movement to argue for \u2018a written constitution in order to protect the rights of citizens against the state. The first with a modern conception of which rights should be inalienable: the right to silence \u2026 and to legal representation; the right to freedom of conscience and freedom of debate; the right to equality before the law and freedom of trade; the right to vote and, when faced with tyranny, to revolution. The Levellers are thus not merely the first modern democrats, but the first to seek to construct a liberal state\u2019.<a class=\"anchor\" id=\"content100note6anc\" name=\"content100note6anc\">\u00a0</a><a class=\"note\" href=\"#content100note6sym\">[\u00a06\u00a0]</a></p>\n<p>If this makes the Levellers sound thoroughly modern, their sources were often antiquated and eclectic: Greco-Roman texts, the Bible, the tradition of natural law theory, and ideas of Anglo-Saxon liberty. When it came to individual natural rights, their reasoning was theological. John Lilburne argued that because God had created man \u2018after His own image\u2019, enduing him with \u2018a rational soul\u2019: \u2018every particular and individual man and woman that ever breathed in the world since\u2019 was \u2018by nature all equal and alike in power, dignity, authority and majesty\u2019. Natural rights were grounded in human dignity which derived from the <i>imago Dei</i>. By invoking rights, the Levellers sought to defend the weak against the mighty. The Levellers saw defence of the marginalised as a biblical imperative. In their writings, the Bible was read as history from below, viewed from the vantage point of the vulnerable.<a class=\"anchor\" id=\"content100note7anc\" name=\"content100note7anc\">\u00a0</a><a class=\"note\" href=\"#content100note7sym\">[\u00a07\u00a0]</a></p>\n<h3><i><b>The Tolerationist Movement and the Right to Religious Liberty</b></i><b>. </b></h3>\n<p>The Levellers drew much of their support from religious minorities like the Baptists, and there was one right above all that they sought to protect: the right to freedom of conscience and worship. Nowadays, we think of this as a global norm, embodied in the UN Declaration of Human Rights (1948): \u2018Everyone has the right to freedom of thought, conscience and religion; this right includes freedom to change his religion or belief, and freedom, either alone or in community with others and in public or private, to manifest his religion or belief in teaching, practice, worship and observance.\u2019 Yet this is a right under threat in many parts of the world, and it was rarely respected in post-Reformation Europe. If we trace how the idea of \u2018rights of conscience\u2019 emerged, we find that it developed from within the Christian tradition. Robert Wilken has argued that we can see it in Church Fathers like Tertullian, who sought to defend the early Christians against persecution by arguing that it was \u2018a privilege inherent in human nature that every person should be able to worship according to his own convictions\u2019.<a class=\"anchor\" id=\"content100note8anc\" name=\"content100note8anc\">\u00a0</a><a class=\"note\" href=\"#content100note8sym\">[\u00a08\u00a0]</a> But when an explicit articulation of subjective natural rights emerged in later medieval thought, no one argued for a right to religious freedom.

Non-Western critics are often more alert to the Christian ancestry of human rights, though they tend to tie it too closely to Western imperialism.<a class=\"anchor\" id=\"content100note18anc\" name=\"content100note18anc\">\u00a0</a><a class=\"note\" href=\"#content100note18sym\">[\u00a018\u00a0]</a> In reality, Christian activists had long spoken the language of human rights to protect the weak from the strong. While believers could be found among the critics of these movements, it is hard to deny that the reformers were fired by a Christian moral imagination.<a class=\"anchor\" id=\"content100note19anc\" name=\"content100note19anc\">\u00a0</a><a class=\"note\" href=\"#content100note19sym\">[\u00a019\u00a0]</a> Understanding this history might make secular citizens more aware of their debts to Christianity; it might also nudge Christians away from the temptation to be too dismissive towards liberal democracy. There are reasons to be sceptical of contemporary rights talk, which has proliferated in ways that would have startled earlier generations. Yet we should guard against an overreaction. Christians often feel like strangers in the modern world, but it is a world that believers (for better or worse) did much to create.</p>\n<h2>Remembering Historic Injustice</h2>\n<p>If debates about the genealogy of rights engage public intellectuals, disputes about historic injustice are now front-page news.<a class=\"anchor\" id=\"content100note20anc\" name=\"content100note20anc\">\u00a0</a><a class=\"note\" href=\"#content100note20sym\">[\u00a020\u00a0]</a></p>\n<p>How we remember past evils has become one of the most hotly contested battlegrounds in our current culture wars.</p>\n<h3><i><b>Black Lives Matter and the History of Racial Injustice</b></i><b>. </b></h3>\n<p>In the wake of the Black Lives Matter movement, Britain and the United States have been confronting uncomfortable questions about historical memory. Statues of slave traders, imperialists and Confederates have been flash points. The <i>New York Times</i> provoked a backlash when it published the \u20181619 Report\u2019, asserting that 1619 (when the first enslaved Africans were landed in British North America) was \u2018the country\u2019s true birth date, the moment that its defining contradictions first came into the world\u2019. In response, President Trump\u2019s 1776 Commission issued a counterblast: \u2018The 1776 Report\u2019. \u2018Team 1619\u2019 urged Americans to lament the past; \u2018Team 1776\u2019 told them to celebrate it. On this too, we find Christians \u2013 even Christian academics \u2013 in rival camps. Trump\u2019s 1776 Commission initially included two senior Christian historians \u2013 Wilfred McClay and Allen Guelzo \u2013 while other Christian scholars have been highly critical of the new drive for \u2018patriotic\u2019 history.<a class=\"anchor\" id=\"content100note21anc\" name=\"content100note21anc\">\u00a0</a><a class=\"note\" href=\"#content100note21sym\">[\u00a021\u00a0]</a></p>\n<h3><i><b>Biblical Narrative and Self-Critique</b></i><b>. </b></h3>\n<p>In a recent paper on \u2018Difficult Histories\u2019, I have argued that Christian memory ought to be shaped by biblical narrative.<a class=\"anchor\" id=\"content100note22anc\" name=\"content100note22anc\">\u00a0</a><a class=\"note\" href=\"#content100note22sym\">[\u00a022\u00a0]</a> Israel\u2019s Scripture is undoubtedly patriotic, yet as the former Chief Rabbi, the late Jonathan Sacks, observed: \u2018The Hebrew Bible is the supreme example of that rarest of phenomena, a national literature of self-criticism. Other ancient civilisations recorded their victories. The Israelites recorded their failures\u2019.<a class=\"anchor\" id=\"content100note23anc\" name=\"content100note23anc\">\u00a0</a><a class=\"note\" href=\"#content100note23sym\">[\u00a023\u00a0]</a> Biblical narrative contrasts with the celebratory stories we prefer to tell about our national, imperial or ecclesial pasts. Biblical history is frequently dark, confronting the worst episodes in Israel\u2019s past; chauvinistic histories typically sidestep our collective moral failings. Biblical history is written from the margins, by a people exiled or colonised; national and imperial histories are written by the winners. Biblical history contains searing self-critique; we often prefer a more soothing account of the past. Biblical history is concerned with justice and oppression; Western histories have often ignored the victims, and even celebrated the perpetrators. The current reckoning with that past is overdue.</p>\n<p>At the same time, biblical memory challenges our tendency to count ourselves among the righteous, whether as chauvinists or censors. The biblical writers had a powerful sense of the pervasiveness of human corruption. Israel and Judah can seem just as flawed as the mighty empires which oppress them. Justice must be pursued, including retributive and reparative justice, but throwing the first stone is a dangerous business. \u2018For in the same way you judge others\u2019, says Jesus, \u2018you will be judged\u2019.<a class=\"anchor\" id=\"content100note24anc\" name=\"content100note24anc\">\u00a0</a><a class=\"note\" href=\"#content100note24sym\">[\u00a024\u00a0]</a> Everyone needs redemption.</p>\n<h3><i><b>A Third Way for Authentic Christian Memory</b></i><b>. </b></h3>\n<p>An authentically Christian memory, shaped by biblical narrative, suggests a third way beyond our \u2018History Wars\u2019. In remembering the past, we should avoid reducing it to its worst features; equally, we should not turn a blind eye to the worst of the past. Christian scholars have a role to play in the cultivation of a less selective memory. Since we acknowledge our own need for forgiveness, we do not set ourselves up as self-righteous censors passing judgment on lesser mortals or past generations. Yet we do have a duty to counteract historical amnesia and the historical nostalgia that celebrates past triumphs but overlooks historic injustice.</p>\n<p>The novelist Marilynne Robinson, whose own thought and writing is infused with a Christian sensibility, has wise words to say about how we view the past:</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>I have read too much history to have any impulse to idealize the past. Great pity and very great respect are owed to all those generations who lived and died before us, not least because they, through war and plague and famine, conferred a precious heritage on us of art, language, music and thought. And they conferred as well a tremendous burden of festering hostilities, vicious inequalities, and outright crimes that we have had no great success in understanding or meliorating, that we have in fact compounded.<a class=\"anchor\" id=\"content100note25anc\" name=\"content100note25anc\">\u00a0</a><a class=\"note\" href=\"#content100note25sym\">[\u00a025\u00a0]</a></p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>I have read too much history to have any impulse to idealize the past.

We owe past generations \u2018great pity\u2019 and \u2018very great respect\u2019 but also moral critique. There is much in the past that is worthy of retrieval and conservation (including a tradition of Christian human rights activism), but there is much to deplore (including centuries of Christian complicity with racial slavery and segregation). Yet we ought to approach our ancestors in chastened mood, with a sharp sense of our own shortcomings. In that way, we might (as we say) \u2018do justice\u2019 to the past. And we might be better equipped, in the words of the prophet Micah, \u2018to act justly and to love mercy and to walk humbly with our God\u2019.</p>\n<h2 class=\"new_page\">End Notes</h2>\n<p class=\"endnote\"><a class=\"note\" href=\"#content100note1anc\">[\u00a01\u00a0]</a><a class=\"anchor\" id=\"content100note1sym\" name=\"content100note1sym\">\u00a0</a> See my book <i>Exodus and Liberation: Deliverance Politics from John Calvin to Martin Luther King Jr.</i> (New York: OUP, 2014), which explores the importance of the Exodus story within Anglophone political culture, from Protestant Reformers and Puritan revolutionaries to abolitionists and Civil Rights leaders.</p>\n<p class=\"endnote\"><a class=\"note\" href=\"#content100note2anc\">[\u00a02\u00a0]</a><a class=\"anchor\" id=\"content100note2sym\" name=\"content100note2sym\">\u00a0</a> See Israel\u2019s mammoth multi-volume history of the Enlightenment beginning with <i>Radical Enlightenment</i> (Oxford: OUP, 2001).</p>\n<p class=\"endnote\"><a class=\"note\" href=\"#content100note3anc\">[\u00a03\u00a0]</a><a class=\"anchor\" id=\"content100note3sym\" name=\"content100note3sym\">\u00a0</a> Samuel Moyn, <i>Christian Human Rights</i> (Philadelphia: University of Pennsylvania Press, 2015); Samuel Moyn, <i>Not Enough: Human Rights in an Unequal World</i> (Cambridge, MA: Belknap Press, 2019).</p>\n<p class=\"endnote\"><a class=\"note\" href=\"#content100note4anc\">[\u00a04\u00a0]</a><a class=\"anchor\" id=\"content100note4sym\" name=\"content100note4sym\">\u00a0</a> See Larry Siedentop, <i>Inventing the Individual: The Origins of Western Liberalism</i> (London: Allen Lane, 2014); Dan Edelstein, <i>On the Spirit of Rights</i> (Chicago: University of Chicago Press, 2019).</p>\n<p class=\"endnote\"><a class=\"note\" href=\"#content100note5anc\">[\u00a05\u00a0]</a><a class=\"anchor\" id=\"content100note5sym\" name=\"content100note5sym\">\u00a0</a> Nigel Biggar, <i>What\u2019s Wrong with Rights</i> (Oxford: OUP, 2020).</p>\n<p class=\"endnote\"><a class=\"note\" href=\"#content100note6anc\">[\u00a06\u00a0]</a><a class=\"anchor\" id=\"content100note6sym\" name=\"content100note6sym\">\u00a0</a> David Wootton, \u2018The Levellers\u2019, in John Dunn, ed., <i>Democracy: The Unfinished Journey</i> (Oxford: Oxford University Press, 1992), p. 71</p>\n<p class=\"endnote\"><a class=\"note\" href=\"#content100note7anc\">[\u00a07\u00a0]</a><a class=\"anchor\" id=\"content100note7sym\" name=\"content100note7sym\">\u00a0</a> See my brief article: \u2018State Democracy and Church democracy: The Levellers and the Bible\u2019: <a href=\"https://www.biblesociety.org.uk/content/explore_the_bible/bible_in_transmission/files/2017_autumn/State_democracy_and_church_democracy.pdf\" target=\"_top\">State_democracy_and_church_democracy.pdf (biblesociety.org.uk)</a></p>\n<p class=\"endnote\"><a class=\"note\" href=\"#content100note8anc\">[\u00a08\u00a0]</a><a class=\"anchor\" id=\"content100note8sym\" name=\"content100note8sym\">\u00a0</a> Robert Louis Wilken, <i>Liberty in the Things of God: The Christian Origins of Religious Freedom</i> (New Haven: Yale University Press, 2019).</p>\n<p class=\"endnote\"><a class=\"note\" href=\"#content100note9anc\">[\u00a09\u00a0]</a><a class=\"anchor\" id=\"content100note9sym\" name=\"content100note9sym\">\u00a0</a> See Brian Tierney, \u2018Religious Rights: A Historical Perspective\u2019, in Noel B.

    "bodyText": "Public health has been defined \u201cthe art and science of preventing disease, prolonging life and promoting health through the organized efforts of society\u201d (Acheson, 1988; WHO). The term \u201cpublic health\u201d might thus concern the study of preventing disease, prolonging life and promoting health, or the actual practice of doing so through the organized efforts of society. The term can also denote the actual state of affairs concerning the health of the public, i.e. the health of a certain population. Health arises in part as a natural state through the operation of normal biological processes, but is shaped in part by access to resources that allow for the promotion and maintenance of health and to resources that allow for the restoration of health. Health itself is constitutive of well-being but also is also important instrumentally in the capacity to attain other goods and ends.\n\nConsiderations of justice within public health arise in part in the context of human subjects research, in part because various resources are advantageous in the maintenance and restoration of health, and in part because health is both intrinsically and instrumentally related to well-being. With regard to research, the Belmont Report (National Commission for the Protection of Human Subjects of Biomedical and Behavioral Research 1979) put forward justice, along with beneficence and respect for persons, as one of three ethical principles to guide human subjects research. However, perhaps more profoundly, justice is relevant within public health because of considerations of the distribution of health and health-related resources, which often, in public health contexts, fall under the rubric of \u201csocial justice\u201d. Because health is shaped in part by access to resources, and because health itself affects our capacity to attain various good and ends, and because public health involves the organized efforts of society to bring about health, public health must fundamentally be concerned with justice.\n\nAs discussed by Wolterstorff (2021), considerations of justice and of the pursuit of justice are also fundamental to the Christian faith. How might then a Christian understanding of justice overlap with, be in tension with, and potentially extend beyond understandings of justice within public health? In this essay, I will briefly consider the concept of justice as it relates to health and public health efforts, and will relate Christian teachings on justice to notions of justice and rights that are commonly held within public health. I will focus principally on the principles put forward in the World Health Organization\u2019s Constitution (WHO, 1946).\n\nWolterstorff (2021) considers various accounts of justice. His favored notion, from the Roman jurist Ulpian is that \u201cjustice is a steady and enduring will to render to each his or her due [or right].\u201d He argues against the notion of justice, found in Aristotle and elsewhere, that justice consists of the equitable or fair distribution of benefits and burdens. However, if those benefits and burdens are themselves understood as respect for rights then the two definitions are effectively equivalent (see also Aquinas 1274/1948 II.II.Q58.1; II.II.Q57.1). Understood thus, justice may pertain to a state of affairs in which each has received his or her due; an act, one which respects rights, or renders to each his or her due; a virtue, the habit of acting with a steady and enduring will to render to each his or her due; or potentially the acts or restitutions required to return to the state of affairs in which each receives his or her due after such a state of affairs has somehow been disrupted.\n\nJustice has sometimes been understood as fairness within the public health context (Daniels, 2008). If fairness is again understood as fairness or equality with respect to rights , then this may indeed be a reasonable conception. Justice with respect for health cannot involve perfect equality of health, which would be both practically unobtainable but could also lead to perverse attempts at reduction to the lowest common attainable standard (Parfitt, 1998; Kass et al., 2015). Wolterstorff (2021) relatedly comments that equity alone does not make distributions just or unjust. However, once again, if justice with respect of health is understood to concern equal respect with regard to rights, then this might be a reasonable way to conceive of justice in the public health context.\n\nThe World Health Organization (WHO) 1946 Constitution puts forward the principle that \u201cThe enjoyment of the highest attainable standard of health is one of the fundamental rights of every human being without distinction of race, religion, political belief, economic or social condition.\u201d The notion of the \u201chighest attainable standard of health\u201d may be interpreted in a way that recognizes that perfect health, and perfect equality of health, may not be attainable. What is \u201cattainable\u201d respects the constraints of nature. Moreover, what is \u201cattainable\u201d may also be understood in a way that respects the freedom of individuals to potentially act in ways that may be contrary to their health, thereby altering what is attainable. What is attainable may also be relative to the resources that are available (Hunt et al., 2015) and indeed the United Nations Committee on Economic, Social and Cultural Rights has subsequently gone some way in specifying what the right to the \u201chighest attainable standard of health\u201d might be understood, in practice, to entail (UNCESCR, 2000). However, even with these caveats, \u201chighest attainable of health [for a given individual]\u201d is a relatively high bar. The notion that the enjoyment of such a standard of health is a right is thus one that needs careful consideration.\n\nNevertheless, because of not only the intrinsic, but also the instrumental role of health in well-being, a commitment to the highest attainable standard of health for all is a laudable goal, one which the Constitution declares is \u201cbasic to the happiness, harmonious relations and security of all peoples.\u201d Health is not only a good that requires justice in its distribution, but one that has implications for justice in the distribution of other goods. The Constitution goes on to state \u201cThe health of all peoples is fundamental to the attainment of peace and security and is dependent upon the fullest co-operation of individuals and States. The achievement of any State in the promotion and protection of health is of value to all. Unequal development in different countries in the promotion of health and control of disease, especially communicable disease, is a common danger.\u201d\n\nThe Constitution further notes the importance of the \u201chealthy development of the child\u201d perhaps implicitly acknowledging the role of the family in ensuring this right to the highest attainable standard of health, and goes on to emphasize the dissemination of health-related knowledge to all people, active cooperation on the part of the public, and the responsibility of governments. The Constitution itself establishes the World Health Organization and states as its objective \u201cthe attainment by all people of the highest possible level of health.\u201d\n\nIt is not entirely clear from the Constitution itself what the grounds are for this purported right. In the terms employed by Wolterstorff, it is unclear from the Constitution whether the right to \u201cthe highest attainable standard of health\u201d is being viewed as a non-conferred human right, or is being proposed as a positive right for States to adopt, or is being put into place as a conferred right that the World Health Organization is itself establishing and taking responsibility for.\n\nAs noted by Wolterstorff, rights also entail duties or responsibilities. One interpretation as to what is being envisioned is that this right to \u201cthe highest attainable standard of health\u201d is to arise from some combination of both non-conferred and positive rights. The World Health Organization\u2019s constitution seems to recognize that the responsibility for attaining the \u201chighest attainable standard of health\u201d lies in part with the individual but also with the broader community, and communities perhaps ranging from the family, to the public health community, to the State, to the World Health Organization itself (cf. Hunt et al., 2015). Each person arguably has the natural right, barring instances of another\u2019s rights being violated, to not be intentionally harmed by other individuals. Parents have both rights and responsibilities to care for their children. A well-functioning state will arguably establish positive rights to various health-related resources. As noted above, the World Health Organization\u2019s Constitution seems to use language that effectively establishes rights conferred by agreement of the World Health Organization and member states. The combination of these might be taken then as establishing a right to the \u201chighest attainable standard of health\u201d that is itself constituted by various natural rights, positive rights, and conferred rights.\n\nHaving considered the notion of rights, let us now turn to the notion of health. How is health itself to be understood? The Constitution\u2019s first principle is in fact, \u201cHealth is a state of complete physical, mental and social well-being and not merely the absence of disease or infirmity.\u201d From a Christian standpoint, and from that of many other world religious traditions, that definition should perhaps be extended to \u201cHealth is a state of complete physical, mental, social well-being, and spiritual well-being\u201d (Larson, 1996; Cloninger et al., 2010; VanderWeele, 2017a). Understood thus, health might be conceived of as wholeness of a person , effectively synonymous with flourishing (VanderWeele, 2017b; VanderWeele et al., 2019a). This might be contrasted with a narrow conception of health involving the health of the body (VanderWeele et al., 2019b) or wholeness of the body. Both the broader and the narrower conceptions are arguably found in ordinary language.\n\nThe broader conception of health as a state of complete physical, mental, social, and spiritual well-being might be viewed within a Christian Biblical understanding as that of shalom (Wolterstorff, 2021). The complete health or wholeness of the person is life lived according to God\u2019s intent. Such a broad conception, inclusive of social well-being, arguably entails also a well-functioning community, one that is just. Justice is thus needed to help ensure a right to the highest attainable standard of health or well-being is realized, but justice (concerning health and other matters) is in fact also constitutive of the health or wholeness of person, and of his or her community, of shalom.\n\nMany of the goals and principles of the public health community are in strong alignment with Christian principles. Goals of child development, prevention of disease, promotion of physical and mental health, harmonious relations and security of all people are arguably goals shared in common by the international public health community and Christian churches. Likewise, principles such as special attention and care for those who are worst off, and respect for the freedom of people, would likewise be shared by these communities (Catholic Church, 2004). Both sets of communities are concerned with justice and there is notable overlap as to how justice is understood.\n\nNevertheless, the set of ends pursued by these communities and the relative weight or importance given to each do vary. The ends of public health organizations do not typically extend to spiritual well-being, whereas religious communities will characteristically prioritize spiritual well-being over other goods, and over physical health. Public health organizations can recognize the spiritual ends sought by religious communities, without necessarily actively advancing them, by respecting and ensuring religious liberty. Nevertheless, tensions between public health organizations and religious communities can arise when these ends of the health of the body, and of spiritual or religious well-being potentially come into conflict.\n\nAn ongoing tension within public health ethics is the extent to which individual freedoms or autonomy can be compromised for the sake of community health (Kass et al., 2015), an issue considered also further below. Justice understood as the state of affairs in which each has been rendered his or her due, or in which the rights of all have been respected, would include not only respect for a right to \u201cthe highest attainable standard of health\u201d but also all other rights, including the right to the free practice of religion.\n\nAn area of substantial tension between public health communities and traditional Christian teaching concerns abortion. The majority view within the international public health community is that individual rights for women entail \u201creproductive rights\u201d which is often understood to include access to safe abortion. The World Health Organization present position concerning abortion is that \u201cEvery individual has the right to decide freely and responsibly \u2013 without discrimination, coercion and violence \u2013 the number, spacing and timing of their children, and to have the information and means to do so, and the right to attain the highest standard of sexual and reproductive health\u2026 Access to legal, safe and comprehensive abortion care, including post-abortion care, is essential for the attainment of the highest possible level of sexual and reproductive health.\u201d (WHO, 2021).\n\nSuch an understanding of rights is in strong tension with the vast majority of the Christian tradition and teaching on abortion (May, 2008), much of which has emphasized the respect for life from the moment of conception until natural death. Under this understanding, the embryo is a human person in development and, as such, has rights, the most fundamental of which is the right to life. Such a right to life would obviously contradict the notion that reproductive rights include a right to abortion.\n\nOf course central to this dispute is who is a bearer of rights and, even more fundamentally, what is a human person? This is arguably first a metaphysical question and second an ethical question. It is not one that can be settled on scientific grounds. Most of the Christian tradition has insisted that from the time of conception, the embryo is a human person in development and the bearer of rights and thus in almost all circumstances it is wrong \u2013 unjust \u2013 to intentionally put an end to this life. This human person in development likewise has a right to the \u201cenjoyment of the highest attainable standard of health\u201d and health itself presupposes life.\n\nHowever, if both the mother and the embryo or fetus has the right to the enjoyment of the highest attainable standard of health, this itself creates responsibilities for the community \u2013 for the public health community, for the state, for the father, for friends, for the extended family. All are to work to attain the highest attainable standard of health for both the mother and the baby. Justice \u2013 respecting the rights of all \u2013 requires work to make such health possible.\n\nIn the case of abortion, tensions concerning rights and justice, potentially arise because of differing metaphysical and ethical positions concerning the notion of persons and the bearers of rights. However, other tensions concerning rights and justice arise within public health and concern individual rights, freedoms, and interests weighed against community interests. A fundamental question that arises in this regard is whether and the extent to which individual rights can be set aside or are suspended for community interests (Lappe, 1986; Kass et al. 2015).\n\nOne idea that has been put forward to navigate this question is that of \u201cproportionality\u201d (Faden and Faden, 1978): the idea that the burden posed by (particularly non-voluntary) interventions should be low and benefits high. This idea has been used to argue that incentives should be favored over disincentives, education favored over manipulative messages, and government intervention ought not occur without considerable evidence about effectiveness. While some have subsequently advocated for voluntary approaches being the only approaches acceptable, counter-arguments have been put forward that since other outside influences can encourage people to alter their preferences unknowingly, coercive measures or potentially manipulative messages are sometimes needed counter these in the interest of public health (Kass et al., 2015). Personal interconnectedness and the mutual influence that people have on one another, both in general in thought and behavior, but also concerning contagion and infectious disease, complicate these matters yet further. These issues have of course been evident in discussions of balancing individual rights with the common good in the recent Covid-19 pandemic.\n\nThese questions of course come down to questions of the rights of individuals and what is owed to individuals by the government both with regard to freedoms but also with regard to preservation of the common good. These are questions of justice. The answer to these questions are not always easy to discern, but they are central to matters of the promotion of public health and the freedom of people to pursue other goods and ends, that may themselves perhaps be viewed as constitutive of health in its broader sense.\n\nIf public health is ultimately aimed at achieving the \u201chighest attainable standard of health\u201d for all, then it is in fact not clear that a focus on justice alone will suffice. A person acts justly by acting so as to render each what is his or her due. This will inevitably entail not intentionally doing harm to another, and doing what is within one\u2019s reasonable ability to help others in one\u2019s community. Attaining health for all will require justice, both so as not to harm the well-being of others and as a constitutive part of what is entailed by the wholeness or well-being of a person and of a community. However, there is only so much an individual can do promote the \u201chighest attainable standard of health\u201d for another.\n\nAny chance of achieving this will require the action of communities and institutions. As noted above, the right to the \u201chighest attainable standard of health\u201d might be viewed as arising out of some combination of human rights, the positive rights granted by governments, and the rights conferred by institutions. However, if health is to be understood as \u201ca state of complete physical, mental and social [and spiritual] well-being,\u201d then it is not clear even just actions of individuals and well-intentioned policies and inteventions of institutions will suffice. If health includes social well-being, more than this may be needed.\n\nSocial relationships are arguably most powerfully and adequately formed out of love, out of a disposition to desire the good for the other and union with the other (Aquinas, 1274/1948, I.II.Q26.4; Stump, 2006). Likewise, from a Christian understanding, attaining spiritual well-being requires charity \u2013 a love for God \u2013 along with the presence of God\u2019s grace and love, characteristically mediated in and through the Church community. Health, understood as the wholeness of the person, requires love.\n\nLove for another will entail justice (cf. Wolterstorff, 2015). One does not properly love the other, or God, if one is not respecting the other person\u2019s rights. But love entails more than justice; it entails a disposition towards willing their good, and to be with them, resulting also in an affirmation of the goodness of their being (Pieper, 1974). It is what almost all persons seek; it is the fabric of social well-being. It is the foundation of spiritual well-being. It is for this reason that the New Testament and Christian teaching put love \u2013 love of God and love of neighbor \u2013 at the foundation of all of the law, of all of ethics (Matt. 22:37-40; Rom. 13:9-10). The wholeness of persons requires justice, but it requires more than justice. It requires love.\n\nLove \u2013 love of neighbor and love of God \u2013 is also needed for health because it is arguably a powerful resource for physical and mental well-being as well. There is now ample empirical evidence that social relationships themselves and participation in religious community (i.e. social and spiritual well-being) profoundly contribute to both physical health and mental health (Holt-Lunstad et al., 2015; VanderWeele, 2017). Social and spiritual well-being are perhaps amongst the most powerful, but neglected, forces for attaining physical and mental health. If we are committed to trying to achieve the \u201chighest attainable standard of health\u201d for all, this will require love. It will require love because love is the foundation of social and spiritual well-being and it will require love because this also powerfully shapes physical and mental well-being also. The only way to adequately attempt to preserve and support the partially conferred right to the \u201cenjoyment of the highest attainable standard of health\u201d is to look beyond rights and beyond justice \u2013 it is to look to love. We must seek a just society \u2013 yes \u2013 but we must also seek to create a civilization of love (Catholic Church, 2004).\n\nFinally, the wholeness of persons and of communities also requires love also because we, as individuals and as communities, are in need of healing. We are in need of healing because there are injustices; there are wrongs; there are hurts. From a Christian understanding, we are in need of healing because there is sin. The administration of justice understood as the acts of punishment or restitutions required to return to the state of affairs that is just can go some way; but it does not fully heal. It alone is often not sufficient to restore a person to wholeness; it often does not heal the relationship or the community. For that we also need forgiveness, understood as the replacing of ill-will towards the offender with good-will, and thus itself a form of love (Stump, 2006). It is in such forgiveness that we are released from the offense and the offender, that healing can occur, and that relationships can, when appropriate, be restored. Forgiveness is not incompatible with justice or with punishment; one can forgive and desire the ultimate well-being of the offender, and yet still seek a just outcome. But forgiveness frees the victim, promotes his or her mental health (as now demonstrated by ample empirical evidence cf. Toussaint et al., 2015; Long et al., 2020), and opens the way for a restoration of wholeness to the individual and the community. In our fallen world, forgiveness is needed for the attainment of health and well-being, and is needed for the restoration of relationships with one another. It is part of Christian teaching that forgiveness is also what is ultimately needed for spiritual well-being, for a restored relationship with God, for a restoration to wholeness as God intended. It is a restoration mysteriously accomplished, and in accord with God\u2019s justice, through the life, death and resurrection of Jesus Christ. Our love is needed to bring about physical, mental, social and spiritual well-being. But God\u2019s love and forgiveness is also needed to bring about this complete restoration to wholeness as well. The highest attainable standard of health cannot be brought about without love.\n\nJustice is constituted by the state of affairs in which each is rendered his or her due. Justice is relevant in considerations of health both with respect to the resources that sustain health, but also with regard to health itself being instrumental in the attaining of other goods and ends. Acknowledging a right to the \u201chighest attainable standard of health\u201d involves a combination of natural rights, positive rights, and conferred rights. If health is to be understood as wholeness of the person \u2013 as a state of complete physical, mental, social, and spiritual well-being \u2013 then this will require the practice and pursuit of justice so as to avoid harm, preserve and promote health, and to create a well-functioning community. However, the end of health \u2013 understood as the wholeness of a person \u2013 requires more than justice; it requires love. Love does not neglect justice, and is compatible with justice, but it extends beyond justice to affirm the goodness of being of the other, to foster social and spiritual well-being, to enable physical and mental health, and to promote the wholeness of the person and of the community according to God\u2019s intent.\n\nAcheson, D.

    "bodyHtml": "<p>Public health has been defined \u201cthe art and science of preventing disease, prolonging life and promoting health through the organized efforts of society\u201d (Acheson, 1988; WHO). The term \u201cpublic health\u201d might thus concern the <em>study</em> of preventing disease, prolonging life and promoting health, or the actual <em>practice</em> of doing so through the organized efforts of society. The term can also denote the actual state of affairs concerning the health of the public, i.e. the health of a certain population. Health arises in part as a natural state through the operation of normal biological processes, but is shaped in part by access to resources that allow for the promotion and maintenance of health and to resources that allow for the restoration of health. Health itself is constitutive of well-being but also is also important instrumentally in the capacity to attain other goods and ends.</p>\n<p>Considerations of justice within public health arise in part in the context of human subjects research, in part because various resources are advantageous in the maintenance and restoration of health, and in part because health is both intrinsically and instrumentally related to well-being. With regard to research, the Belmont Report (National Commission for the Protection of Human Subjects of Biomedical and Behavioral Research 1979) put forward justice, along with beneficence and respect for persons, as one of three ethical principles to guide human subjects research. However, perhaps more profoundly, justice is relevant within public health because of considerations of the <em>distribution</em> of health and health-related resources, which often, in public health contexts, fall under the rubric of \u201csocial justice\u201d. Because health is shaped in part by access to resources, and because health itself affects our capacity to attain various good and ends, and because public health involves the organized efforts of society to bring about health, public health must fundamentally be concerned with justice.</p>\n<p>As discussed by Wolterstorff (2021), considerations of justice and of the pursuit of justice are also fundamental to the Christian faith. How might then a Christian understanding of justice overlap with, be in tension with, and potentially extend beyond understandings of justice within public health? In this essay, I will briefly consider the concept of justice as it relates to health and public health efforts, and will relate Christian teachings on justice to notions of justice and rights that are commonly held within public health. I will focus principally on the principles put forward in the World Health Organization\u2019s Constitution (WHO, 1946).</p>\n<h2>The Concept of Justice</h2>\n<p>Wolterstorff (2021) considers various accounts of justice. His favored notion, from the Roman jurist Ulpian is that \u201cjustice is a steady and enduring will to render to each his or her due [or right].\u201d He argues against the notion of justice, found in Aristotle and elsewhere, that justice consists of the equitable or fair distribution of benefits and burdens. However, if those benefits and burdens are themselves understood as respect for rights then the two definitions are effectively equivalent (see also Aquinas 1274/1948 II.II.Q58.1; II.II.Q57.1). Understood thus, justice may pertain to a <em>state of affairs</em> in which each has received his or her due; an act, one which respects rights, or renders to each his or her due; a virtue, the habit of acting with a steady and enduring will to render to each his or her due; or potentially the acts or restitutions required to return to the state of affairs in which each receives his or her due after such a state of affairs has somehow been disrupted.</p>\n<p>Justice has sometimes been understood as fairness within the public health context (Daniels, 2008). If fairness is again understood as fairness or equality <em>with respect to rights</em>, then this may indeed be a reasonable conception. Justice with respect for health cannot involve perfect equality of health, which would be both practically unobtainable but could also lead to perverse attempts at reduction to the lowest common attainable standard (Parfitt, 1998; Kass et al., 2015). Wolterstorff (2021) relatedly comments that equity alone does not make distributions just or unjust. However, once again, if justice with respect of health is understood to concern equal respect with regard to rights, then this might be a reasonable way to conceive of justice in the public health context.</p>\n<h2>Rights to the \u201cHighest Attainable Standard of Health\u201d</h2>\n<h3>Principles of the WHO.</h3>\n<p>The World Health Organization (WHO) 1946 Constitution puts forward the principle that \u201cThe enjoyment of the highest attainable standard of health is one of the fundamental rights of every human being without distinction of race, religion, political belief, economic or social condition.\u201d The notion of the \u201chighest attainable standard of health\u201d may be interpreted in a way that recognizes that perfect health, and perfect equality of health, may not be attainable. What is \u201cattainable\u201d respects the constraints of nature. Moreover, what is \u201cattainable\u201d may also be understood in a way that respects the freedom of individuals to potentially act in ways that may be contrary to their health, thereby altering what is attainable. What is attainable may also be relative to the resources that are available (Hunt et al., 2015) and indeed the United Nations Committee on Economic, Social and Cultural Rights has subsequently gone some way in specifying what the right to the \u201chighest attainable standard of health\u201d might be understood, in practice, to entail (UNCESCR, 2000). However, even with these caveats, \u201chighest attainable of health [for a given individual]\u201d is a relatively high bar. The notion that the enjoyment of such a standard of health is a <em>right</em> is thus one that needs careful consideration.</p>\n<h3>Intrinsic and Instrumental Goals of Health.</h3>\n<p>Nevertheless, because of not only the intrinsic, but also the instrumental role of health in well-being, a commitment to the highest attainable standard of health for all is a laudable goal, one which the Constitution declares is \u201cbasic to the happiness, harmonious relations and security of all peoples.\u201d Health is not only a good that requires justice in its distribution, but one that has implications for justice in the distribution of other goods. The Constitution goes on to state \u201cThe health of all peoples is fundamental to the attainment of peace and security and is dependent upon the fullest co-operation of individuals and States. The achievement of any State in the promotion and protection of health is of value to all. Unequal development in different countries in the promotion of health and control of disease, especially communicable disease, is a common danger.\u201d</p>\n<p>The Constitution further notes the importance of the \u201chealthy development of the child\u201d perhaps implicitly acknowledging the role of the family in ensuring this right to the highest attainable standard of health, and goes on to emphasize the dissemination of health-related knowledge to all people, active cooperation on the part of the public, and the responsibility of governments. The Constitution itself establishes the World Health Organization and states as its objective \u201cthe attainment by all people of the highest possible level of health.\u201d</p>\n<p>It is not entirely clear from the Constitution itself what the grounds are for this purported right. In the terms employed by Wolterstorff, it is unclear from the Constitution whether the right to \u201cthe highest attainable standard of health\u201d is being viewed as a non-conferred human right, or is being proposed as a positive right for States to adopt, or is being put into place as a conferred right that the World Health Organization is itself establishing and taking responsibility for.</p>\n<h3>Whose Responsibility for Rights to Health?</h3>\n<p>As noted by Wolterstorff, rights also entail duties or responsibilities. One interpretation as to what is being envisioned is that this right to \u201cthe highest attainable standard of health\u201d is to arise from some combination of both non-conferred and positive rights. The World Health Organization\u2019s constitution seems to recognize that the responsibility for attaining the \u201chighest attainable standard of health\u201d lies in part with the individual but also with the broader community, and communities perhaps ranging from the family, to the public health community, to the State, to the World Health Organization itself (cf. Hunt et al., 2015). Each person arguably has the natural right, barring instances of another\u2019s rights being violated, to not be intentionally harmed by other individuals. Parents have both rights and responsibilities to care for their children. A well-functioning state will arguably establish positive rights to various health-related resources. As noted above, the World Health Organization\u2019s Constitution seems to use language that effectively establishes rights conferred by agreement of the World Health Organization and member states. The combination of these might be taken then as establishing a right to the \u201chighest attainable standard of health\u201d that is itself constituted by various natural rights, positive rights, and conferred rights.</p>\n<h2>Health as Wholeness</h2>\n<p>Having considered the notion of rights, let us now turn to the notion of health. How is health itself to be understood? The Constitution\u2019s first principle is in fact, \u201cHealth is a state of complete physical, mental and social well-being and not merely the absence of disease or infirmity.\u201d From a Christian standpoint, and from that of many other world religious traditions, that definition should perhaps be extended to \u201cHealth is a state of complete physical, mental, social well-being, and <em>spiritual</em> well-being\u201d (Larson, 1996; Cloninger et al., 2010; VanderWeele, 2017a). Understood thus, health might be conceived of as wholeness <em>of a person</em>, effectively synonymous with flourishing (VanderWeele, 2017b; VanderWeele et al., 2019a). This might be contrasted with a narrow conception of health involving the <em>health of the body</em> (VanderWeele et al., 2019b) or wholeness of the body. Both the broader and the narrower conceptions are arguably found in ordinary language.</p>\n<p>The broader conception of health as a state of complete physical, mental, social, and spiritual well-being might be viewed within a Christian Biblical understanding as that of shalom (Wolterstorff, 2021). The complete health or wholeness of the person is life lived according to God\u2019s intent. Such a broad conception, inclusive of social well-being, arguably entails also a well-functioning community, one that is just. Justice is thus needed to help ensure a right to the highest attainable standard of health or well-being is realized, but justice (concerning health and other matters) is in fact also constitutive of the health or wholeness of person, and of his or her community, of shalom.</p>\n<h2>Shared and Divergent Goals with the Public Health Community</h2>\n<h3>Shared Goals</h3>\n<p>Many of the goals and principles of the public health community are in strong alignment with Christian principles. Goals of child development, prevention of disease, promotion of physical and mental health, harmonious relations and security of all people are arguably goals shared in common by the international public health community and Christian churches. Likewise, principles such as special attention and care for those who are worst off, and respect for the freedom of people, would likewise be shared by these communities (Catholic Church, 2004). Both sets of communities are concerned with justice and there is notable overlap as to how justice is understood.</p>\n<h3>Divergent Goals</h3>\n<p>Nevertheless, the set of ends pursued by these communities and the relative weight or importance given to each do vary. The ends of public health organizations do not typically extend to spiritual well-being, whereas religious communities will characteristically prioritize spiritual well-being over other goods, and over physical health. Public health organizations can recognize the spiritual ends sought by religious communities, without necessarily actively advancing them, by respecting and ensuring religious liberty. Nevertheless, tensions between public health organizations and religious communities can arise when these ends of the health of the body, and of spiritual or religious well-being potentially come into conflict.</p>\n<p>An ongoing tension within public health ethics is the extent to which individual freedoms or autonomy can be compromised for the sake of community health (Kass et al., 2015), an issue considered also further below. Justice understood as the state of affairs in which each has been rendered his or her due, or in which the rights of all have been respected, would include not only respect for a right to \u201cthe highest attainable standard of health\u201d but also all other rights, including the right to the free practice of religion.</p>\n<h2>Bearers of Rights and Christian Tensions within Public Health</h2>\n<p>An area of substantial tension between public health communities and traditional Christian teaching concerns abortion. The majority view within the international public health community is that individual rights for women entail \u201creproductive rights\u201d which is often understood to include access to safe abortion. The World Health Organization present position concerning abortion is that \u201cEvery individual has the right to decide freely and responsibly \u2013 without discrimination, coercion and violence \u2013 the number, spacing and timing of their children, and to have the information and means to do so, and the right to attain the highest standard of sexual and reproductive health\u2026 Access to legal, safe and comprehensive abortion care, including post-abortion care, is essential for the attainment of the highest possible level of sexual and reproductive health.\u201d (WHO, 2021).</p>\n<p>Such an understanding of rights is in strong tension with the vast majority of the Christian tradition and teaching on abortion (May, 2008), much of which has emphasized the respect for life from the moment of conception until natural death. Under this understanding, the embryo is a human person in development and, as such, has rights, the most fundamental of which is the right to life. Such a right to life would obviously contradict the notion that reproductive rights include a right to abortion.</p>\n<p>Of course central to this dispute is who is a bearer of rights and, even more fundamentally, what is a human person? This is arguably first a metaphysical question and second an ethical question. It is not one that can be settled on scientific grounds. Most of the Christian tradition has insisted that from the time of conception, the embryo is a human person in development and the bearer of rights and thus in almost all circumstances it is wrong \u2013 unjust \u2013 to intentionally put an end to this life. This human person in development likewise has a right to the \u201cenjoyment of the highest attainable standard of health\u201d and health itself presupposes life.</p>\n<p>However, if both the mother and the embryo or fetus has the right to the enjoyment of the highest attainable standard of health, this itself creates responsibilities for the community \u2013 for the public health community, for the state, for the father, for friends, for the extended family. All are to work to attain the highest attainable standard of health for both the mother and the baby. Justice \u2013 respecting the rights of all \u2013 requires work to make such health possible.</p>\n<h2>Individual Rights versus the Common Good in Public Health</h2>\n<p>In the case of abortion, tensions concerning rights and justice, potentially arise because of differing metaphysical and ethical positions concerning the notion of persons and the bearers of rights. However, other tensions concerning rights and justice arise within public health and concern individual rights, freedoms, and interests weighed against community interests. A fundamental question that arises in this regard is whether and the extent to which individual rights can be set aside or are suspended for community interests (Lappe, 1986; Kass et al. 2015).</p>\n<p>One idea that has been put forward to navigate this question is that of \u201cproportionality\u201d (Faden and Faden, 1978): the idea that the burden posed by (particularly non-voluntary) interventions should be low and benefits high. This idea has been used to argue that incentives should be favored over disincentives, education favored over manipulative messages, and government intervention ought not occur without considerable evidence about effectiveness. While some have subsequently advocated for voluntary approaches being the only approaches acceptable, counter-arguments have been put forward that since other outside influences can encourage people to alter their preferences unknowingly, coercive measures or potentially manipulative messages are sometimes needed counter these in the interest of public health (Kass et al., 2015). Personal interconnectedness and the mutual influence that people have on one another, both in general in thought and behavior, but also concerning contagion and infectious disease, complicate these matters yet further. These issues have of course been evident in discussions of balancing individual rights with the common good in the recent Covid-19 pandemic.</p>\n<p>These questions of course come down to questions of the rights of individuals and what is owed to individuals by the government both with regard to freedoms but also with regard to preservation of the common good. These are questions of justice. The answer to these questions are not always easy to discern, but they are central to matters of the promotion of public health and the freedom of people to pursue other goods and ends, that may themselves perhaps be viewed as constitutive of health in its broader sense.</p>\n<h2>Love and Justice in Public Health</h2>\n<h3><strong>Justice Alone will not Suffice</strong></h3>\n<p>If public health is ultimately aimed at achieving the \u201chighest attainable standard of health\u201d for all, then it is in fact not clear that a focus on justice alone will suffice. A person acts justly by acting so as to render each what is his or her due. This will inevitably entail not intentionally doing harm to another, and doing what is within one\u2019s reasonable ability to help others in one\u2019s community. Attaining health for all will require justice, both so as not to harm the well-being of others and as a constitutive part of what is entailed by the wholeness or well-being of a person and of a community. However, there is only so much an individual can do promote the \u201chighest attainable standard of health\u201d for another.</p>\n<p>Any chance of achieving this will require the action of communities and institutions. As noted above, the right to the \u201chighest attainable standard of health\u201d might be viewed as arising out of some combination of human rights, the positive rights granted by governments, and the rights conferred by institutions. However, if health is to be understood as \u201ca state of complete physical, mental and social [and spiritual] well-being,\u201d then it is not clear even just actions of individuals and well-intentioned policies and inteventions of institutions will suffice. If health includes social well-being, more than this may be needed.</p>\n<h3>Health and Wholeness Require Love</h3>\n<p>Social relationships are arguably most powerfully and adequately formed out of love, out of a disposition to desire the good for the other and union with the other (Aquinas, 1274/1948, I.II.Q26.4; Stump, 2006). Likewise, from a Christian understanding, attaining spiritual well-being requires charity \u2013 a love for God \u2013 along with the presence of God\u2019s grace and love, characteristically mediated in and through the Church community. Health, understood as the wholeness of the person, requires love.</p>\n<p>Love for another will entail justice (cf. Wolterstorff, 2015). One does not properly love the other, or God, if one is not respecting the other person\u2019s rights. But love entails more than justice; it entails a disposition towards willing their good, and to be with them, resulting also in an affirmation of the goodness of their being (Pieper, 1974). It is what almost all persons seek; it is the fabric of social well-being. It is the foundation of spiritual well-being. It is for this reason that the New Testament and Christian teaching put love \u2013 love of God and love of neighbor \u2013 at the foundation of all of the law, of all of ethics (Matt. 22:37-40; Rom. 13:9-10). The wholeness of persons requires justice, but it requires more than justice. It requires love.</p>\n<h3>Relationships Profoundly Contribute to Health</h3>\n<p>Love \u2013 love of neighbor and love of God \u2013 is also needed for health because it is arguably a powerful resource for physical and mental well-being as well. There is now ample empirical evidence that social relationships themselves and participation in religious community (i.e. social and spiritual well-being) profoundly contribute to both physical health and mental health (Holt-Lunstad et al., 2015; VanderWeele, 2017). Social and spiritual well-being are perhaps amongst the most powerful, but neglected, forces for attaining physical and mental health. If we are committed to trying to achieve the \u201chighest attainable standard of health\u201d for all, this will require love. It will require love because love is the foundation of social and spiritual well-being and it will require love because this also powerfully shapes physical and mental well-being also. The only way to adequately attempt to preserve and support the partially conferred right to the \u201cenjoyment of the highest attainable standard of health\u201d is to look beyond rights and beyond justice \u2013 it is to look to love. We must seek a just society \u2013 yes \u2013 but we must also seek to create a civilization of love (Catholic Church, 2004).</p>\n<h3>Wholeness Requires Healing from Injustice</h3>\n<p>Finally, the wholeness of persons and of communities also requires love also because we, as individuals and as communities, are in need of healing. We are in need of healing because there are injustices; there are wrongs; there are hurts. From a Christian understanding, we are in need of healing because there is sin. The administration of justice understood as the acts of punishment or restitutions required to return to the state of affairs that is just can go some way; but it does not fully heal. It alone is often not sufficient to restore a person to wholeness; it often does not heal the relationship or the community. For that we also need forgiveness, understood as the replacing of ill-will towards the offender with good-will, and thus itself a form of love (Stump, 2006). It is in such forgiveness that we are released from the offense and the offender, that healing can occur, and that relationships can, when appropriate, be restored. Forgiveness is not incompatible with justice or with punishment; one can forgive and desire the ultimate well-being of the offender, and yet still seek a just outcome. But forgiveness frees the victim, promotes his or her mental health (as now demonstrated by ample empirical evidence cf. Toussaint et al., 2015; Long et al., 2020), and opens the way for a restoration of wholeness to the individual and the community. In our fallen world, forgiveness is needed for the attainment of health and well-being, and is needed for the restoration of relationships with one another. It is part of Christian teaching that forgiveness is also what is ultimately needed for spiritual well-being, for a restored relationship with God, for a restoration to wholeness as God intended. It is a restoration mysteriously accomplished, and in accord with God\u2019s justice, through the life, death and resurrection of Jesus Christ. Our love is needed to bring about physical, mental, social and spiritual well-being. But God\u2019s love and forgiveness is also needed to bring about this complete restoration to wholeness as well. The highest attainable standard of health cannot be brought about without love.</p>\n<h2>Summary: The End of Health Requires Justice and Love</h2>\n<p>Justice is constituted by the state of affairs in which each is rendered his or her due. Justice is relevant in considerations of health both with respect to the resources that sustain health, but also with regard to health itself being instrumental in the attaining of other goods and ends. Acknowledging a right to the \u201chighest attainable standard of health\u201d involves a combination of natural rights, positive rights, and conferred rights. If health is to be understood as wholeness of the person \u2013 as a state of complete physical, mental, social, and spiritual well-being \u2013 then this will require the practice and pursuit of justice so as to avoid harm, preserve and promote health, and to create a well-functioning community. However, the end of health \u2013 understood as the wholeness of a person \u2013 requires more than justice; it requires love. Love does not neglect justice, and is compatible with justice, but it extends beyond justice to affirm the goodness of being of the other, to foster social and spiritual well-being, to enable physical and mental health, and to promote the wholeness of the person and of the community according to God\u2019s intent.</p>\n<h2 class=\"new_page\">References</h2>\n<p class=\"reference\">Acheson, D.

    "bodyText": "Tim Keller offers a straightforward definition of justice: \u2018giving humans their due as people in the image of God\u2019 (Scharold and Keller 2010). I like this definition, as does Wolterstorff (p.8). But when I challenge myself to unpack the notion of justice in light of my academic interests, I find myself understanding it as being intimately related to the creation, curation, and maintenance of the conditions for collective human flourishing. Two precepts flow from this conception of justice: that notions of justice are unavoidably political; and that there is something about justice that requires constant recalibration or re-adjustment.\n\nMy research interests lead me to interrogate the idea of justice in much the same way as the political theorist Charles Beitz, who, at the outset of his classic article \u2018Justice and International Relations\u2019, posed the following question: \u201cDo citizens of relatively affluent countries have obligations founded on justice to share their wealth with poorer people elsewhere?\u201d (Beitz 1975, 360). This question increasingly occupies my own attempts to \u2018think Christianly\u2019 about how states provide development aid (see Day 2020). For me, the most basic answer to this question is settled: yes, citizens of affluent countries do have such obligations. The more difficult (and more pressing) question is how we\u2014as both individuals and as members of political communities\u2014should most effectively discharge these obligations in a rapidly changing global environment.\n\nInternational Relations (IR) primarily considers interactions between states , the most macro-level institutionalised communities of global politics. [\u00a01\u00a0] Furthermore, for a range of historical, disciplinary and theoretical reasons, IR scholars have focused predominantly on the most powerful states and conceptualised them as unitary actors. This \u2018billiard ball\u2019 model of states, which \u2018black boxes\u2019 internal dynamics influencing behaviour, reduces interstate relations to an arena governed by materialistic laws derived from the relative economic and military might of its constituent units. This conceptualisation is problematic in myriad ways. Most consequential for the discussion at hand is how it dissolves the space for agency. Valerie Hudson (2005, 2) gets to the heart of this problem when she explains how states simply cannot function as independent actors in practice: \u201cStates are not agents because states are abstractions and thus have no agency\u201d.\n\nThe reason this theoretical discussion is relevant to a discussion about the pursuit of justice is because it drives at a crucial practical question: who does justice? Is it individuals, or is it states? Or is it some combination of both? In addition, how are we, as individuals, responsible for the action of the states we belong to? Getting even more practical, consider the question of redressing unequal development. Is the provision of bilateral (i.e. state-to-state) international development assistance something the state does? Or is the state acting on behalf of its citizens? Or is it perhaps the remit of a leader exercising agency on behalf of the citizens of a state?\n\nThese questions are the remit of political theory. In his book Political Theory and International Relations (Beitz 1979), Bietz essentially translates John Rawls\u2019 theory of justice from the domestic sphere to the international one. Beitz considers how Rawls\u2019 primarily within-state theory of justice applies between states. At issue is where\u2014and how\u2014to draw boundaries around political communities, especially as they relate to responsibilities to do justice to individuals outside these boundaries. Do states have obligations to individuals beyond their borders? What are they and to what extent should they operate? Such questions are not new, of course. They are central to enduring debates in political theory. But they have taken on fresh impetus in light of recent political framing pitting \u2018Nationalists\u2019 versus \u2018Globalists\u2019, most notably in the United States but also in the United Kingdom and elsewhere in the West (albeit often employing slightly different terminology). The way these terms have become (or, perhaps more accurately, have been made ) so politically salient illustrates just how relevant questions concerning international \u2018boundary-drawing\u2019 have become in contemporary political life.\n\nIn my observation, scholars of IR, as well as many Christians, are inclined to draw boundaries of moral responsibility too narrowly and too neatly. In both cases, this can lead to a tendency to excise obligations for individuals and states to do justice in part because of the ease of hiding behind neat and politically convenient international boundaries. To be clear, I am not saying here that states and their leaders do not have primary obligations (\u2018special duties\u2019) to their own citizens. Rather, I am arguing that the balance between the way states approach \u2018doing justice\u2019 to those inside their borders versus those outside them needs active tending. This tension\u2014between the degree and direction that obligations and benefits do (and should) run between individuals within states and individuals beyond that same state\u2019s borders\u2014will always be challenging to navigate. Nonetheless, I am of the view that this \u2018insider-outsider\u2019 tension has recently been resolved too far in the favour of the insider, at least in the rich Western states with which I am most familiar.\n\nAgainst the backdrop of a changing and uncertain global order, there is a mood among Western states to circumscribe their international justice-doing activities. This tendency is evident in policies relating to immigration (see, for example, Glanville and Glanville 2020), climate change, development assistance, and now in the rise of vaccine nationalism, on which I will elaborate below.\n\nThree brief observations will help to sketch why I think we, as Christian justice-seekers-and-doers, need to be concerned about this relative tilt towards focusing \u2018within states\u2019 versus beyond borders. First, for most of us, the nature of our practical engagement with each other across the globe makes national-international distinctions virtually obsolete in important domains. This is especially the case when it comes to financial markets. Reitz\u2019s critique of Rawls turns on this notion. Beitz (1979, 374) argues that because the borders of states do not, in practice, demarcate where social interactions stop, then neither should they demarcate where social obligations stop. If global economic interdependence was substantial enough for Beitz to level these arguments over half a century ago, then the dramatic growth in international capital flows, people flows, information flows and trade since then strengthens this argument immensely. As Kok-Chor Tan (2004, 33) writes, \u201cthe greater economic \u201cmutual connexion\u201d\u2019 brought about by globalization, \u201chas made the question of global justice all the more pertinent.\u201d\n\nSecond, the rules and institutions that govern these cross-border flows are themselves often a source of injustice, not least because the rules are typically written (and underwritten) by the most powerful states. As Kok-Chor Tan (2004, 21) acknowledges, \u201cA theory of global justice would thus not only be concerned with the particular actions and foreign policies of individual countries, but, very importantly and more fundamentally, it would be concerned also with the background global institutional context within which countries interact\u201d. In other words, many of our shortcomings in doing justice beyond borders relate to not seeing (or being unwilling to see) how our own behaviours are contributing to the perpetration of injustice elsewhere. Expressed in more technical language, we are typically much more aware of our failures to uphold \u2018positive duties\u2019 (obligations that we should undertake to help others) than our failures to uphold our \u2018negative duties\u2019 (obligations not to inadvertently harm others through our actions).\n\nI explore this dynamic as it applies to the provision of development aid in my recent article, which draws on Amos as a lens for \u2018thinking Christianly\u2019 (Day 2020). I argue that rapid recent changes in global financial flows now mean that, more than ever before, what a state gives on the one hand through the provision of development aid (complying with a positive duty), it can easily take away with the other, through the pursuit of non-aid policies that harm developing countries (violating negative duties). Examples of non-aid policies of rich states that harm developing countries include unfair laws and practices concerning trade, arms transfers, agricultural and fishing subsidies, intellectual property laws and remittances.\n\nA final observation concerns a particular manifestation of human selfishness. While we are quick to identify the limits of our obligations, very often advocating that they diminish (at best) at the border of our state, we rarely treat the benefits we accrue from outside our state in the same manner. For example, citizens of rich states obtain multitudes of cheap goods manufactured overseas that they use every day.\n\nIn their article on \u2018crisis nationalism\u2019, Eilidh Beaton and her co-authors state that \u201cThe COVID-19 pandemic presents a challenge for global justice: how should affluent countries balance their special duties to their own citizens and residents against their impartial duties of global justice?\u201d (Beaton et al. 2021, 297). Since COVID-19 does not respect national boundaries, the most effective response to the virus would also be supranational. In practice, however, states have focused almost exclusively on their own needs. In many ways, what Beaton et. al term \u2018national partiality\u2019 is understandable in this crisis situation. Indeed, one might argue it is warranted: states should protect their own people to the best of their ability. However, the difference in this case is that the logic of extreme self-interest is ultimately counterproductive. Thomas Bollyky and Chad Brown (2020) pointedly assert that \u2018Vaccine Nationalism Will Prolong the Pandemic\u2019: \u201cDistributing scarce early vaccine supplies to the settings and populations where they can do the most good is the most efficient way to bring this pandemic under control. Doing so would also speed the global economic recovery and avoid unnecessary geopolitical conflict.\u201d\n\nBollyky and Brown go on to report how many rich countries purchased more potential vaccines than they needed, with Canada reserving \u201cenough potential doses to vaccinate its population more than four times over.\u201d At the time these authors were writing in late 2020, \u201cNations representing just one-seventh of the world\u2019s population [had] reserved more than half of all the promising vaccine supplies.\u201d In contrast, COVAX, the multilateral entity established to provide vaccines to lower-income countries, is struggling. According to Wouters et. al, \u201cthe widespread disregard for a global approach to vaccine allocation shown by national governments misses an opportunity to maximise the common good by reducing the global death toll, supporting widespread economic recovery, and mitigating supply chain disruptions\u201d (Wouters et al. 2021, 1031).\n\nClearly, there are great injustices evident in the ability of different states to respond to the pandemic. Yet perhaps even more problematic than the inequalities around procurement, delivery and administration of vaccines\u2014and certainly less visible\u2014is the way that longstanding violations of negative duties by rich countries are curtailing poor countries from being able to respond to COVID-19. As Eilidh Beaton and colleagues argue, \u201cWhen existing global injustices have enabled some countries to exercise crisis nationalism, the case for partiality is morally suspect\u201d (Beaton et al. 2021, 293).\n\nConsider some of the impacts that just one domain of global injustice has had on the ability of poor countries to respond to the pandemic: the lack of access to global credit markets. In his recent paper reflecting on the likely impact of COVID-19 on the future of global development, Homi Kharas (2021, 3) points out how \u201cAdvanced economy governments have the exorbitant privilege of borrowing in their own currencies, while development countries cannot.\u201d This reality has important flow on effects. First, the inability of poor countries to borrow is a large part of why they are at the back of the vaccine line (Collins and Holder 2021). The risk of pre-ordering prospective vaccines was too high. Second, while rich states have borrowed cheaply to finance huge stimulus spending, many poor nations have virtually no capacity to mount a fiscal response. In my own region, Australia was able to leverage additional expenditure in response to COVID-19 of 9.5% of GDP. This compares to 0.6% of GDP in Papua New Guinea (PNG) and 0.8% of GDP in Fiji, the Pacific Island region\u2019s two biggest economies (Howes and Surandiran 2020). So, for example, not only is PNG\u2019s economy much smaller in aggregate than Australia\u2019s to begin with (around 60 times smaller), the size of its fiscal response as a proportion of its economy was also much smaller (around 16 times smaller). Third, the labour force in low-income economies is overwhelming employed in the informal sector. Such workers have their livelihoods withdrawn during lock-downs, unable to work from home via an online connection. They therefore likely find themselves in the double bind of being unable to access credit markets at the personal level, as well as living in a state that is unable to access credit markets for social spending.\n\nIn his brief, Wolterstorff voices his concern that scholars working across many academic disciplines, even those that \u201cdeal directly with interactions among human beings and social entities\u201d, can become so beholden to reductionism that they do not bring justice \u201cinto the picture\u201d. In this brief, I have tried to illustrate how scholars of International Relations are perhaps especially prone to this. The shape of the IR discipline means we face a pernicious form of reductionism that reduces states\u2014the largest political communities comprising the globe and the historical focus of the discipline\u2014to abstractions. The risk here is that, in the service of theoretical parsimony, people are squeezed out of the conceptual and analytical frame. Conceptualising states as mechanistic and deterministic entities tends to obscure that doing justice\u2014or not doing justice\u2014is a choice, made by people.\n\nThe challenge set by Wolterstorff\u2019s brief is for us to broaden our horizons of moral obligation and responsibility, both within our disciplines and within the academy more broadly. The COVID-19 pandemic, and especially the rise of vaccine nationalism, serves as a reminder of our collective tendency to \u2018close down\u2019 in the face of fear or uncertainty. It is also a reminder of how such responses can frustrate justice.\n\nJ. A. Motyer, The Day of the Lion: The Message of Amos . Downers Grove, Ill.: InterVarsity Press, 1974).

    "bodyHtml": "<p>Tim Keller offers a straightforward definition of justice: \u2018giving humans their due as people in the image of God\u2019 (Scharold and Keller 2010). I like this definition, as does Wolterstorff (p.8). But when I challenge myself to unpack the notion of justice in light of my academic interests, I find myself understanding it as being intimately related to the creation, curation, and maintenance of the conditions for collective human flourishing. Two precepts flow from this conception of justice: that notions of justice are unavoidably political; and that there is something about justice that requires constant recalibration or re-adjustment.</p>\n<h2>Justice in International Relations</h2>\n<p>My research interests lead me to interrogate the idea of justice in much the same way as the political theorist Charles Beitz, who, at the outset of his classic article \u2018Justice and International Relations\u2019, posed the following question: \u201cDo citizens of relatively affluent countries have obligations founded on justice to share their wealth with poorer people elsewhere?\u201d (Beitz 1975, 360). This question increasingly occupies my own attempts to \u2018think Christianly\u2019 about how states provide development aid (see Day 2020). For me, the most basic answer to this question is settled: yes, citizens of affluent countries <em>do</em> have such obligations. The more difficult (and more pressing) question is how we\u2014as both individuals <em>and</em> as members of political communities\u2014should most effectively discharge these obligations in a rapidly changing global environment.</p>\n<h3><em><strong>Who</strong></em><strong> does Justice?</strong></h3>\n<p>International Relations (IR) primarily considers interactions between <em>states</em>, the most macro-level institutionalised communities of global politics.<a class=\"anchor\" id=\"content100note1anc\" name=\"content100note1anc\">\u00a0</a><a class=\"note\" href=\"#content100note1sym\">[\u00a01\u00a0]</a> Furthermore, for a range of historical, disciplinary and theoretical reasons, IR scholars have focused predominantly on the most powerful states and conceptualised them as unitary actors. This \u2018billiard ball\u2019 model of states, which \u2018black boxes\u2019 internal dynamics influencing behaviour, reduces interstate relations to an arena governed by materialistic laws derived from the relative economic and military might of its constituent units. This conceptualisation is problematic in myriad ways. Most consequential for the discussion at hand is how it dissolves the space for agency. Valerie Hudson (2005, 2) gets to the heart of this problem when she explains how states simply cannot function as independent actors in practice: \u201cStates are not agents because states are abstractions and thus have no agency\u201d.</p>\n<p>The reason this theoretical discussion is relevant to a discussion about the pursuit of justice is because it drives at a crucial practical question: who <em>does</em> justice? Is it individuals, or is it states? Or is it some combination of both? In addition, how are we, as individuals, responsible for the action of the states we belong to? Getting even more practical, consider the question of redressing unequal development. Is the provision of bilateral (i.e. state-to-state) international development assistance something the <em>state</em> does? Or is the state acting on behalf of its citizens? Or is it perhaps the remit of a leader exercising agency on behalf of the citizens of a state?</p>\n<h3>Nationalists versus Globalists</h3>\n<p>These questions are the remit of political theory. In his book <em>Political Theory and International Relations </em>(Beitz 1979), Bietz essentially translates John Rawls\u2019 theory of justice from the domestic sphere to the international one. Beitz considers how Rawls\u2019 primarily within-state theory of justice applies <em>between</em> states. At issue is where\u2014and how\u2014to draw boundaries around political communities, especially as they relate to responsibilities to do justice to individuals outside these boundaries. Do states have obligations to individuals beyond their borders? What are they and to what extent should they operate? Such questions are not new, of course. They are central to enduring debates in political theory. But they have taken on fresh impetus in light of recent political framing pitting \u2018Nationalists\u2019 versus \u2018Globalists\u2019, most notably in the United States but also in the United Kingdom and elsewhere in the West (albeit often employing slightly different terminology). The way these terms have become (or, perhaps more accurately, have been<em> made</em>) so politically salient illustrates just how relevant questions concerning international \u2018boundary-drawing\u2019 have become in contemporary political life.</p>\n<p>In my observation, scholars of IR, as well as many Christians, are inclined to draw boundaries of moral responsibility too narrowly and too neatly. In both cases, this can lead to a tendency to excise obligations for individuals and states to do justice in part because of the ease of hiding behind neat and politically convenient international boundaries. To be clear, I am not saying here that states and their leaders do not have primary obligations (\u2018special duties\u2019) to their own citizens. Rather, I am arguing that the balance between the way states approach \u2018doing justice\u2019 to those inside their borders versus those outside them needs active tending. This tension\u2014between the degree and direction that obligations and benefits do (and should) run between individuals within states and individuals beyond that same state\u2019s borders\u2014will always be challenging to navigate. Nonetheless, I am of the view that this \u2018insider-outsider\u2019 tension has recently been resolved too far in the favour of the insider, at least in the rich Western states with which I am most familiar.</p>\n<p>Against the backdrop of a changing and uncertain global order, there is a mood among Western states to circumscribe their international justice-doing activities. This tendency is evident in policies relating to immigration (see, for example, Glanville and Glanville 2020), climate change, development assistance, and now in the rise of vaccine nationalism, on which I will elaborate below.</p>\n<h3>Why Christians Should Widen Their Horizons</h3>\n<p>Three brief observations will help to sketch why I think we, as Christian justice-seekers-and-doers, need to be concerned about this relative tilt towards focusing \u2018within states\u2019 versus beyond borders. First, for most of us, the nature of our practical engagement with each other across the globe makes national-international distinctions virtually obsolete in important domains. This is especially the case when it comes to financial markets. Reitz\u2019s critique of Rawls turns on this notion. Beitz (1979, 374) argues that because the borders of states do not, in practice, demarcate where social interactions stop, then neither should they demarcate where social obligations stop. If global economic interdependence was substantial enough for Beitz to level these arguments over half a century ago, then the dramatic growth in international capital flows, people flows, information flows and trade since then strengthens this argument immensely. As Kok-Chor Tan (2004, 33) writes, \u201cthe greater economic \u201cmutual connexion\u201d\u2019 brought about by globalization, \u201chas made the question of global justice all the more pertinent.\u201d</p>\n<p>Second, the rules and institutions that govern these cross-border flows are themselves often a source of injustice, not least because the rules are typically written (and underwritten) by the most powerful states. As Kok-Chor Tan (2004, 21) acknowledges, \u201cA theory of global justice would thus not only be concerned with the particular actions and foreign policies of individual countries, but, very importantly and more fundamentally, it would be concerned also with the background global institutional context within which countries interact\u201d. In other words, many of our shortcomings in doing justice beyond borders relate to not seeing (or being <em>unwilling</em> to see) how our own behaviours are contributing to the perpetration of injustice elsewhere. Expressed in more technical language, we are typically much more aware of our failures to uphold \u2018positive duties\u2019 (obligations that we should undertake to help others) than our failures to uphold our \u2018negative duties\u2019 (obligations not to inadvertently harm others through our actions).</p>\n<p>I explore this dynamic as it applies to the provision of development aid in my recent article, which draws on Amos as a lens for \u2018thinking Christianly\u2019 (Day 2020). I argue that rapid recent changes in global financial flows now mean that, more than ever before, what a state gives on the one hand through the provision of development aid (complying with a positive duty), it can easily take away with the other, through the pursuit of non-aid policies that harm developing countries (violating negative duties). Examples of non-aid policies of rich states that harm developing countries include unfair laws and practices concerning trade, arms transfers, agricultural and fishing subsidies, intellectual property laws and remittances.</p>\n<p>A final observation concerns a particular manifestation of human selfishness. While we are quick to identify the limits of our obligations, very often advocating that they diminish (at best) at the border of our state, we rarely treat the benefits we accrue from outside our state in the same manner. For example, citizens of rich states obtain multitudes of cheap goods manufactured overseas that they use every day.</p>\n<h2>COVID-19 and Vaccine Nationalism</h2>\n<p>In their article on \u2018crisis nationalism\u2019, Eilidh Beaton and her co-authors state that \u201cThe COVID-19 pandemic presents a challenge for global justice: how should affluent countries balance their special duties to their own citizens and residents against their impartial duties of global justice?\u201d (Beaton et al. 2021, 297). Since COVID-19 does not respect national boundaries, the most effective response to the virus would also be supranational. In practice, however, states have focused almost exclusively on their own needs. In many ways, what Beaton et. al term \u2018national partiality\u2019 is understandable in this crisis situation. Indeed, one might argue it is warranted: states <em>should</em> protect their own people to the best of their ability. However, the difference in this case is that the logic of extreme self-interest is ultimately counterproductive. Thomas Bollyky and Chad Brown (2020) pointedly assert that \u2018Vaccine Nationalism Will Prolong the Pandemic\u2019: \u201cDistributing scarce early vaccine supplies to the settings and populations where they can do the most good is the most efficient way to bring this pandemic under control. Doing so would also speed the global economic recovery and avoid unnecessary geopolitical conflict.\u201d</p>\n<h3>Inequalities in Vaccine Allocation</h3>\n<p>Bollyky and Brown go on to report how many rich countries purchased more potential vaccines than they needed, with Canada reserving \u201cenough potential doses to vaccinate its population more than four times over.\u201d At the time these authors were writing in late 2020, \u201cNations representing just one-seventh of the world\u2019s population [had] reserved more than half of all the promising vaccine supplies.\u201d<sup> </sup>In contrast, COVAX, the multilateral entity established to provide vaccines to lower-income countries, is struggling. According to Wouters et. al, \u201cthe widespread disregard for a global approach to vaccine allocation shown by national governments misses an opportunity to maximise the common good by reducing the global death toll, supporting widespread economic recovery, and mitigating supply chain disruptions\u201d (Wouters et al. 2021, 1031).</p>\n<p>Clearly, there are great injustices evident in the ability of different states to respond to the pandemic. Yet perhaps even more problematic than the inequalities around procurement, delivery and administration of vaccines\u2014and certainly less visible\u2014is the way that longstanding violations of negative duties by rich countries are curtailing poor countries from being able to respond to COVID-19. As Eilidh Beaton and colleagues argue, \u201cWhen existing global injustices have enabled some countries to exercise crisis nationalism, the case for partiality is morally suspect\u201d (Beaton et al. 2021, 293).</p>\n<h3>Impacts on Poor Countries</h3>\n<p>Consider some of the impacts that just one domain of global injustice has had on the ability of poor countries to respond to the pandemic: the lack of access to global credit markets. In his recent paper reflecting on the likely impact of COVID-19 on the future of global development, Homi Kharas (2021, 3) points out how \u201cAdvanced economy governments have the exorbitant privilege of borrowing in their own currencies, while development countries cannot.\u201d This reality has important flow on effects. First, the inability of poor countries to borrow is a large part of why they are at the back of the vaccine line (Collins and Holder 2021). The risk of pre-ordering prospective vaccines was too high. Second, while rich states have borrowed cheaply to finance huge stimulus spending, many poor nations have virtually no capacity to mount a fiscal response. In my own region, Australia was able to leverage additional expenditure in response to COVID-19 of 9.5% of GDP. This compares to 0.6% of GDP in Papua New Guinea (PNG) and 0.8% of GDP in Fiji, the Pacific Island region\u2019s two biggest economies (Howes and Surandiran 2020). So, for example, not only is PNG\u2019s economy much smaller in aggregate than Australia\u2019s to begin with (around 60 times smaller), the size of its fiscal response as a proportion of its economy was also much smaller (around 16 times smaller). Third, the labour force in low-income economies is overwhelming employed in the informal sector. Such workers have their livelihoods withdrawn during lock-downs, unable to work from home via an online connection. They therefore likely find themselves in the double bind of being unable to access credit markets at the personal level, as well as living in a state that is unable to access credit markets for social spending.</p>\n<h2>Beyond Reductionism</h2>\n<p>In his brief, Wolterstorff voices his concern that scholars working across many academic disciplines, even those that \u201cdeal directly with interactions among human beings and social entities\u201d, can become so beholden to reductionism that they do not bring justice \u201cinto the picture\u201d. In this brief, I have tried to illustrate how scholars of International Relations are perhaps especially prone to this. The shape of the IR discipline means we face a pernicious form of reductionism that reduces states\u2014the largest political communities comprising the globe and the historical focus of the discipline\u2014to abstractions. The risk here is that, in the service of theoretical parsimony, people are squeezed out of the conceptual and analytical frame. Conceptualising states as mechanistic and deterministic entities tends to obscure that doing justice\u2014or not doing justice\u2014is a choice, made by people.</p>\n<p>The challenge set by Wolterstorff\u2019s brief is for us to broaden our horizons of moral obligation and responsibility, both within our disciplines and within the academy more broadly.

Contrast laws promulgated by international organizations, such as UN treaties or the Inter-American Court of Human Rights, or laws produced by national institutions, such as India\u2019s Parliament or Brazil\u2019s administrative agencies, or state laws and municipal ordnances authorized by subnational or local bodies, such as Nigeria\u2019s state governments or the Jakarta city council.\n\nIncreasingly these laws are woven together into transnational legal orders (TLOs). These orders penetrate deeply into our national and local \u201cordinary affairs.\u201d Indeed, I propose that we cannot come to terms with the international order in the 21 st C without recognizing that much of the drama in international social, economic and even political orders is not only about state-to-state relations, the classic focus international relations scholarship and practice, but also about the rise and fall, cooperation and competition of TLOs. These orders shape increasingly more expansive zones of social behavior. We are all influenced by many of them, whether or not we are aware of their day-to-day influence in our lives.\n\nA transnational legal order (TLO) arises when individuals or industries or states or non-profit organizations or international organizations or any other kind of social actor seeks to solve problems that span national borders by legal means. These problems are as wide as the human condition:\n\nIf the issue is violence against women in civil conflicts , then a body of law has built up through international tribunals such as the International Criminal Tribunal for the Former Yugoslavia and the International Criminal Court that penetrates into state courts and reaches to warlords and other violators of international humanitarian law.\n\nIf the problem is how to save failing businesses , then there is a Legislative Guide on Insolvency produced by the UN Commission on International Trade Law (UNCITRAL) which is more or less reflected in the legislation of many countries in all regions.\n\nIf the issue is protecting the world from pandemics , then a complex of global, regional and national rules run from the World Health Organization to regional and national regulatory bodies to local hospitals.\n\nIn practice, a TLO can be the response to any social, economic or political issue that actors or norm entrepreneurs can successfully frame as a \u201cproblem\u201d to be solved in whole or in part by law.\n\nI have stated that a TLO rises or falls in response to problems of some sort or other. These problems, of course, are identified and framed in certain ways by actors who can include individuals, industry groups, religious organizations, politicians, civil servants, elected officials, crime control authorities, authoritarian rulers, international civil servants, international NGOs \u2013 the list is almost endless. These actors seek to diagnose a problem in a certain way, obtain support for that diagnosis, then implement a solution that will remedy the ill through law, through a TLO.\n\nA TLO has three elements. [\u00a01\u00a0]\n\nA TLO is transnational : that is, it seeks to bring orderly relationships sometimes across the borders of states such as the US or Mexico, China and South Korea, India and Pakistan; sometimes across entire regions, such as the African Union or the Latin American human rights order; sometimes across the world, such as the UN Commission on International Trade Law\u2019s Rotterdam Rules on carrying goods across oceans where much of world trade occurs.\n\nA TLO is legal. Here I adopt a sociolegal definition of law that is expansive. It includes so-called hard law , which is produced internationally in the form of treaties between states and which are binding on those states, or which is produced within states by Parliaments or executive agencies and which are enforced by domestic authorities. It also includes soft law, which now embraces a vast array of legal instruments, scripts and accountability devices, ranging from legislative guides and model laws to standards, guides, best practices, principles, codes of conduct and the like.\n\nA TLO is constructed to produce order . For a TLO to be fully established there will be a continuity or similarity or concordance of laws between transnational bodies, national legal institutions and local institutions. For example, the international standards of corporate bankruptcy law are recognizable in Australia\u2019s or South Korea\u2019s bankruptcy laws, and reach down to local courts in the provinces and towns of both countries. This order is intended to guide behavior in predictable ways that are observable in patterns of behavior.\n\nMy colleagues in international relations at the Australian National University, however, point out another critical reason for thinking about TLOs at this moment in contemporary history. [\u00a02\u00a0] They express the view that a liberal international order has been dominant in the world since a new architecture of institutions and laws emerged from the ashes of WWII. That architecture led to international institutions (the UN, World Bank, International Monetary Fund, World Health Organization, among hundreds of others) which created and propagated a kind of international rule of law with courts and tribunals to arbitrate amongst conflicting parties in international disputes, such as the rights that China, Vietnam, Philippines and other states have in the South China Sea. Both the architecture and institutions were led and dominated by the victors of WWII and their ways of thinking. The TLOs that have arisen at rapidly rising rates in the last fifty years are embedded within this liberal international order. Many TLOs are premised on the belief that there are universal rules, applicable to all, and binding morally and in law. Disputes are settled by negotiation or arbitration or conciliation or decisions by neutral tribunals. Those decisions should be binding and behavior by states or corporations or individuals should conform to them.\n\nAt present, there is something of a revolt against this international order. Most confrontationally it is led by China which chafes at standards and practices of the international community, for example, on rule of law or human rights, that lead to criticism and condemnation of its domestic behavior. Yet there is another line of critique that converges with the theological ethics proposed in the NWTB. There is some justice in the charge that the rules of the international order were ordered and over-determined by powerful western states in the international political economy \u2013 the US, European states, and later other rich countries allied with them, conventionally those 38 countries in the Organization for Economic Cooperation and Development (OECD). Justice principles should invigorate a re-appraisal of the existing order.\n\nIf TLOs are widespread, probably growing in number and in the pace of their formation, and if TLOs are consequential, stretching from global/regional/transnational IOs to national capitals to provinces, cities, towns and villages in all regions, then they should be the focus of theological ethics.\n\nNWTB opens up that prospect, beginning with the OT imperative to do \u201csocial (systemic) justice\u201d(p1). Where NWTB opens the door to social institutions within the state, we may widen the scale of social institutions to those beyond the state\u2014the international and the global.\n\nWhat is this field of institutions? It includes: international organizations of states (e.g., UN, EU, OECD, or Mercator, the South American trade bloc); international non-governmental organizations (INGOs); international industry and professional associations; International religious groups; interrnational bodies of indigenous or dominated peoples, e.g., World Uyghur Congress, International Campaign for Tibet; and international media, among others. The list is almost endless and it grows geometrically, given the vibrancy of international civil society and the inter-dependency of states in the 21 st century.\n\nNWTB\u2019s pairing of the Isaiah 61 and Luke 4 passages opens up the prospect that justice orientations to the institutions, actors, processes and products of TLOs must embrace not only individuals and classes of people within states, but extend to \u201cpoor\u201d peoples and first-nation tribes and weak states in the international economic and political orders; \u201ccaptives\u201d in political prisons in despotic regimes or refugee camps in Bangladesh or Gaza; \u201coppressed\u201d peoples, such as the Uyghurs in concentration camps in Xinjiang, China, or the billions suffering under repressive rulers; and the \u201cbroken-hearted\u201d refugees in Europe or South East Asia who are losing their families, languages, culture and customs.\n\nWe have seen that NWTB writes of first-order justice as \u201cjustice in how we treat others in our ordinary affairs\u201d (6). This justice may be systemic and reach to the institutions of education, finance and business, health and geopolitics, among others. In each of these institutions or social systems, says Wolterstorff, we are charged with giving others their due, affirming their excellences, acknowledging their rights, uplifting their dignity and worth (9). To a considerable extent, TLOs provide the legal skeleton and muscle of first-order justice. Pick any institution in modern societies\u2014the family, education, religion, leisure, the arts, science, business, travel, health, politics\u2014and it will become quickly apparent that there are transnational laws, echoed or crafted by national lawmakers, and integrated into local institutions. What happens in Lima, Peru, or Tacoma, Washington, or Nairobi, Kenya, or Suva, Fiji, is directly or indirectly being shaped by a TLO. If the shape of these first-order institutions are molded by TLOs, then TLOs themselves should be subject, NWTB implies, to the theological ethics of justice and rights.\n\nI have elsewhere argued that a justice orientation derived from the logics of Isa 61 and Luke 4 warrants particular attention to weak actors in TLOs. [\u00a03\u00a0] That attention is both a matter of pragmatics and ethics. With respect to pragmatics, it acknowledges what Wolterstorff calls \u201cexcellences,\u201d in this case of so-called weak states. With respect to ethics, it recognizes that dignity should be accorded to states and organizations at the margins of the international political economy, to transitional and developing economies, to frail states struggling to consolidate the most basic institutions of statehood, such as an economy or education or health system.\n\nTwo ethical standards of justice illustrate how common ground can be found for Christian ethics and sociological analysis. I apply both here to the process of creating laws for the world, as building blocks of TLOs, in international organizations.\n\nIn his writings on the \u201cglobal common good\u201d, Roman Catholic theologian, David Hollenbach, [\u00a04\u00a0] critiques \u201cglobal political institutions\u201d for excluding the voices of many of the world\u2019s peoples from the creation of rules that will influence their lives. He proposes four ways that I find useful to better understand the meaning of my own research on global lawmaking: (a) they need to be sitting at the lawmaking table; (b) they need to be able to \u201cvoice\u201d their views; (c) they need to be drawn into dialog where their views are discussed; and (d) they need to be casting votes and exercising influence when decisions are made.\n\nIf we take these four ways as Christian ethical ideals for the construction of a just TLO, then a social scientist can readily translate them into empirical research questions, such as:\n\nWhat actors (states, organizations) are aware of lawmaking efforts?\n\nWho is invited to participate?\n\nWho gets to set the lawmaking agenda?\n\nWho attends the lawmaking sessions?\n\nWho gets to participate in the informal dialogs that always characterize international negotiations?\n\nWho is heard?\n\nWho has impact, and how?\n\nIn all these ways the dignity of the weak, the voices of the marginal, the excellences of the supposedly peripheral can be addressed in two ways. They can be appraised \u2014do actual practices fall short of the Christian ideal of participation? They can also be corrected \u2014are international organizations changing their practices of lawmaking, of constructing and adapting TLOs in ways that accord with Wolterstorff\u2019s ideals of justice and rights as they are specified more empirically in global forums?\n\nIn response to his question, \u201cCan Globalization be Shaped?\u201d, theologian Miroslav Volf [\u00a05\u00a0] argues for freely exercising \u201cinitiative and creativity\u201d in defending the weakest across the world. Similar notes are struck by others\u2014Max Stackhouse in his call for nurture and release of our God-given abilities to pursue the universal common good, and Pope John Paul II for living out, in the global domain, \u201cthe creativity which is the distinguishing mark of the human person.\u201d\n\nThe transnational and global lawmaking that is an essential part of a TLO invariably requires creativity. Oddly, this is not much studied by social scientists. However, if theologians press social scientists to imagine how global lawmaking might be seen through a theological lens of creativity it opens up several vistas where views may be shared.\n\nFor instance, in my reflections on weak global actors in global lawmaking, the institutions conforming to ideals of a first-order justice might enhance creativity in several ways: (a) imagining new forums or the adaptations of current lawmaking forums to draw out the creativities of weak actors; (b) listening to the views of weak actors on which kinds of law (e.g., treaties, models laws, guidelines) are more likely to be accepted by their governments and society; (c) recognizing that weak actors, such as emerging economies, may have particular problems that require attention less relevant to advanced economies; and (d) acknowledging the special expertises of government leaders, lawmakers and law implementers, in what will or will not work in their special circumstances.\n\nFor me, Wolterstorff\u2019s term of \u201cexcellences\u201d creates a kind of mental shift. It affirms dignity and acknowledges the giftedness of God\u2019s grace given to delegates and delegations too often thought as deprived or unsophisticated or to be treated as law-takers and not law-makers. It demands a theologically-inspired re-orientation towards the architects and builders of TLOs.\n\nFirst, he points to the several levels of social behavior where justice and rights are salient. While he uses interactions between persons, dyads, as his idiomatic mainstay, he notes that the logic of his argument applies to all social institutions within a society. For those of us who work on international institutions and global politics and society, we would take a step farther and explore more thoughtfully what justice ethics and Christian conceptions of rights can be brought to bear on the international sphere.\n\nSecond, we should bolster our theological understanding of first-order justice by examining how those \u201cfirst-order institutions\u201d are permeated by TLOs beyond the state, by the state, within the state. For all laws within a TLO the NWTB calls upon us to bring a theological standard both at the highest levels of giving others \u201ctheir due\u201d and recognizing their rights and \u201cexcellences\u201d, and at more empirically observable levels of such theological ethics as the enhancement of decision-making participation and affirmations of diverse creativities.\n\nI conclude with two questions.\n\nHow can we expand this conversation between theologians and social scientists to help Christians and persons of faith to \u201cthink big\u201d, i.e., think beyond the personal or the local and relational to institutions and states? Even farther, in a world of global interdependence and global rivalry, how may we carry further our Christian theological ethics into international organizations, transnational and global orders?\n\nI may also ask a question of myself and all other scholars who work on international institutions. Does a theological ethics of justice and rights exert a special calling on Christian scholars of global governance? What does it ask of me as I study TLOs, global norms and who makes them, how they are made, what opportunities and creativities they open up for those whose voices are marginalized, and how effective they are in bringing justice to the poor, imprisoned, oppressed and heart-broken?\n\nSusan Block-Lieb and Terence C.

However, if theologians press social scientists to imagine how global lawmaking might be seen through a theological lens of creativity it opens up several vistas where views may be shared.</p>\n<p>For instance, in my reflections on weak global actors in global lawmaking, the institutions conforming to ideals of a first-order justice might enhance creativity in several ways: (a) imagining new forums or the adaptations of current lawmaking forums to draw out the creativities of weak actors; (b) listening to the views of weak actors on which kinds of law (e.g., treaties, models laws, guidelines) are more likely to be accepted by their governments and society; (c) recognizing that weak actors, such as emerging economies, may have particular problems that require attention less relevant to advanced economies; and (d) acknowledging the special expertises of government leaders, lawmakers and law implementers, in what will or will not work in their special circumstances.</p>\n<p>For me, Wolterstorff\u2019s term of \u201cexcellences\u201d creates a kind of mental shift. It affirms dignity and acknowledges the giftedness of God\u2019s grace given to delegates and delegations too often thought as deprived or unsophisticated or to be treated as law-takers and not law-makers. It demands a theologically-inspired re-orientation towards the architects and builders of TLOs.</p>\n<h2>Conclusion</h2>\n<p>Professor Wolterstorff frames his Theology Brief in terms which enable its extrapolation in two ways that are highly relevant for my research on TLOs.</p>\n<p>First, he points to the several levels of social behavior where justice and rights are salient. While he uses interactions between persons, dyads, as his idiomatic mainstay, he notes that the logic of his argument applies to all social institutions within a society. For those of us who work on international institutions and global politics and society, we would take a step farther and explore more thoughtfully what justice ethics and Christian conceptions of rights can be brought to bear on the international sphere.</p>\n<p>Second, we should bolster our theological understanding of first-order justice by examining how those \u201cfirst-order institutions\u201d are permeated by TLOs beyond the state, by the state, within the state. For all laws within a TLO the NWTB calls upon us to bring a theological standard both at the highest levels of giving others \u201ctheir due\u201d and recognizing their rights and \u201cexcellences\u201d, and at more empirically observable levels of such theological ethics as the enhancement of decision-making participation and affirmations of diverse creativities.</p>\n<p>I conclude with two questions.</p>\n<p>How can we expand this conversation between theologians and social scientists to help Christians and persons of faith to \u201cthink big\u201d, i.e., think beyond the personal or the local and relational to institutions and states? Even farther, in a world of global interdependence and global rivalry, how may we carry further our Christian theological ethics into international organizations, transnational and global orders?</p>\n<p>I may also ask a question of myself and all other scholars who work on international institutions. Does a theological ethics of justice and rights exert a special calling on Christian scholars of global governance? What does it ask of me as I study TLOs, global norms and who makes them, how they are made, what opportunities and creativities they open up for those whose voices are marginalized, and how effective they are in bringing justice to the poor, imprisoned, oppressed and heart-broken?</p>\n<h2 class=\"new_page\">Further Reading</h2>\n<p>Susan Block-Lieb and Terence C.

    "bodyText": "I take it as axiomatic that the God who made the profusion of creation is also the God of the profusion we find in human language and voice. Genesis 1 bears witness to the unstinting abundance that God created, and John 1 places the Word at the heart of that creation. In language, a surfeit of variety meets us everywhere. We hear a profusion of voices in society. We are immersed in languages, dialects, varieties, genres, accents, jargons, styles. They eddy and swirl round us in an always-changing current of linguistic reproduction and creation.\n\nLanguage is also a social fact, implicated in the shape of society. It is an identity bearer, a means of self-expression. Our voice in particular is always embodied, personal, situated. Language is wholly interactive (in accord with Wolterstorff\u2019s stress on the centrality of interaction), a bridge between self and other, central to communication. As well as a truth teller, language can also be a deceiver. Social inequities produce linguistic inequities, and language reproduces injustice in many areas of society: structures, demographics, power, gender, ethnicity, globalization. Not all the voices of society are easily or equally heard.\n\nThe founding sociolinguist Dell Hymes had a concern for justice and how that is evidenced and substantiated in the voices of society \u2013 who speaks, who is listened to, who is valued, who is disregarded. \u2018One way to think of the society in which one would like to live is to think of the kinds of voices it would have\u2019, he wrote (1996: 64). In such a sociolinguistics of voice, linguistic justice is something that is not a given but needs to be accomplished. It invites and requires engagement in society, including intellectual engagement. It is a continuation of the Old Testament tradition where the prophetic voice was central to guiding and correcting Israel in the ways of justice.\n\nLinguistic justice begins with a most basic question: What is a language? It turns out this is not a simple or objective matter.\n\nThere are languages in the world that have different names but are linguistically very similar \u2013 Hindi/Urdu, Serbian/Croatian. They are kept apart by political rather than linguistic boundaries. There are other clusters of linguistic codes which are so diverse that some are not mutually intelligible, but they bear a single name such as Arabic or Chinese. They are held together by political rather than linguistic factors. \u2018A language is a dialect with an army and navy\u2019, is an axiom credited to the early 20 th century Yiddish linguist Max Weinreich. It is social and political rather than linguistic factors that give a language its status.\n\nThe notion of identifiable languages (and often, their identification with a nation) is in fact an 18 th century Enlightenment construct, but one that was imposed on the rest of the world through European colonizers. These \u2013 including Christian missionaries - enthusiastically distinguished, defined and named \u2018languages\u2019 wherever they went. In west Africa in the late 19 th century, for example, French military expeditions traversed what was to become Senegal, mapping the boundaries of groups and their languages (Irvine & Gal 2000). The languages and their speakers were interpreted as having essential characteristics, including different levels of intelligence. The groups were assumed to be monolingual, but clean boundaries between them could only be mapped by ignoring the prevailing multilingualism. The imperial payoff for such idealizations was that territories and their peoples were identified, segmented and ready for governance.\n\nWolterstorff has referred to the ways in which elitist and colonialist practices promote injustice. In language, the fruits of inequitable colonial, postcolonial and quasi-colonial ideologies are still manifest in today\u2019s world. Sociolinguistic studies have examined the requirement for contestants to speak fluent English not Swahili to win a national beauty contest in Tanzania (Billings 2009); the oppression of the Oroqen language of northeastern China under colonization by the Han Chinese and their language, Mandarin (Li Fengxiang 2005); and the triumph of Bahasa Indonesia as the national language of Indonesia at the expense of many local languages (Errington 1998). In these and many other situations, groups of speakers find their voices stifled by unconscious attitudes or intentional policies.\n\nIdeologies of language value one linguistic form or code as better or worse than another, promoting some people\u2019s voices and muzzling others\u2019.\n\nA language, dialect or feature may be taken as representative of a group of people. Although the association with the group is arbitrary, iconization treats the feature as somehow having a natural and inherent link with the group. This is a very ancient scenario, shown by the story of shibboleth in Judges chapter 12. After defeating the tribe of Ephraim in battle, the Gileadites waited for the fleeing Ephraimites at the River Jordan:\n\nWhenever one of the fugitives of Ephraim said, \u2018Let me go over\u2019, the men of Gilead would say to him, \u2018Are you an Ephraimite?\u2019 When he said, \u2018No\u2019, they said to him, \u2018Then say Shibboleth\u2019, and he said, \u2018Sibboleth\u2019, for he could not pronounce it right. Then they seized him and killed him at the fords of the Jordan. (NRSV)\n\nThe word shibboleth has been carried into English to mean precisely a language feature which is identified with a group.\n\nIf what you speak is not recognized as a language, your voice may be denigrated or ignored, you will likely be subject to linguistic injustice. Hungarian speakers in Romania, for example, believe their speech is inferior to that spoken in Hungary. In countless countries, minority-group children have been punished for speaking their home language at school. These evaluations represent the belief that one linguistic form or code is better or worse than another. It sounds more beautiful or more ugly, is superior or inferior, is more or less moral. This forms the basis for linguistic injustice. We place people socially by the way they talk. As George Bernard Shaw wrote in the preface to his play Pygmalion , words later paraphrased into one of the songs of My Fair Lady:\n\nAn Englishman\u2019s way of speaking absolutely classifies him, The moment he talks he makes some other Englishman despise him.\n\nIn the United States, mental mapping studies of dialect regions show that the dialects which are the most salient to Americans are precisely the ones that they despise \u2013 those of New York City and the South. Denigration of other people\u2019s accents is widespread, and its saddest outcome is how often it is reflected in speakers also downgrading their own accent.\n\nJesus was also probably subject to linguistic denigration. We know that Galilee was regarded as a cultural backwater by the Jerusalem elite \u2013 reflected in Nathaniel\u2019s rhetorical question, \u2018Can anything good come out of Nazareth?\u2019 (John 1: 46). From the Gospels, we also know how distinctive was the Galilean accent (presumably of Aramaic), because it gave Peter away as he hovered on the edges of Jesus\u2019 trial (Matthew 26: 73). We can assume that Jesus had a similar accent to Peter\u2019s, so the Jerusalem rulers\u2019 hostility was probably not just to what Jesus said but to how he said it. His voice was \u2018despised and rejected\u2019.\n\nThe Russian thinker Mikhail Bakhtin, an unorthodox Orthodox Christian of the early 20 th century, maintained that language is a site of struggle between the dynamic centrifugal forces which whirl it apart into diversity, and the hegemonic centripetal forces which strive to standardize and prescribe the way language should be. He celebrates the centrifugal - the divergence, individuality, creativity, even the chaos of language variety.\n\nLanguage standardization through the education system is a primary site of linguistic injustice. Even the world\u2019s best-known standard accent - British Received Pronunciation (\u2018the Queen\u2019s English/BBC English\u2019) - is a relatively recent invention: before the mid-18 th century there was no sense of a standard pronunciation for English. Still nowadays only a small minority of the British population can speak this standard. French is arguably the world\u2019s most standardized language, since the founding of the Acad\u00e9mie Fran\u00e7aise in the 17 th century. As the sociologist Pierre Bourdieu has theorized, using the standard gives its speaker linguistic capital . Even French encompasses a large range of variety that is ignored in defining what the standard is, to the point of excluding the idea that variety even exists.\n\nIf speaking the standard is a social advantage, then lacking it will be a disadvantage. The unavoidable outcome of language standardization is inequity, certainly for some, often for the many. The routine companion of linguistic disadvantage is economic and social disadvantage, whether that be for Moroccans in France, northerners in England, Quechua speakers in Peru, or African Americans. If the \u2018best people\u2019 speak in a certain way, you will not become one of the best people without their speech. In his preface to the manual Rhyming Roadways to Good Speech (1940), Professor F. Sinclaire of Canterbury University College, New Zealand, wrote:\n\nDebased speech \u2013 it cannot too strongly be insisted \u2013 is a symptom of general cultural debasement, of growing insensibility to values which lie at the very roots of all culture. Someone has said that people who talk through the nose will think through the nose. It is certain that if we speak badly we shall think badly and feel coarsely.\n\nQuoted in Gordon & Abell (1990: 30)\n\nHowever, local and subcultural groups create and maintain countervailing linguistic norms which are defiantly oppositional to the standard. The vernacular \u2013 rather, \u2018vernaculars\u2019, always pluralized - is immensely more variegated than the standard, and is the usual locus of linguistic innovation and creativity. Shared local networks and practices serve as vernacular maintenance mechanisms with their own powers of persuasion and conformity in the face of institutional propagation of the standard. Most people accept the standard as natural, normal, commonsense, eliding the often conflictual socioeconomic and sociolinguistic realities. But on the basis of speech, people \u2013 including academics - have been prepared to make large social and personal judgments.\n\nThe stabilizing, centralizing impetus of linguistic standard and convention is in tension with the decentralizing, momentary, creative use of language. The centrifugal forces are always spinning new words, new dialects, new languages, new voices, regardless of all efforts to the contrary by academies, educators, politicians or pedants. However, the belief that monolingualism is natural and that multilingualism is a curse is deeply embedded in western consciousness, and it is the Bible that has provided the leading image and narrative of this in the cultural memory of the West.\n\nThe story in Genesis 11 is usually interpreted as a condemnation of language diversity, and is still enormously influential and productive. But there is an alternative reading available for the narrative: that the judgment of Babel promoted the spread of humankind and the rich diversification of its languages. The fault of Babel was not pride but a refusal to disperse and \u2018fill the earth\u2019 as mandated at creation and after the flood. In Bell (2011) I argue that Babel is a blessing rather than a curse, adopting the interpretation proposed by Walter Brueggemann (1982). Babel is in this reading a charter for linguistic variety, a manifesto for multilingualism rather than a lament for lost monolingualism.\n\nThere is a close link between this view of Babel and Bakhtin\u2019s centrifugal forces in language change. Babel is in part a story about linguistic power, about the social and political meanings of monolingualism and multilingualism. As indicated earlier, the European nation-state was created with the assumption that a nation should have its own single language. Such monolingualism is routinely coercive against other languages. Babel stands as a monument to the ultimate futility of the drive to enforce monolingualism.\n\nThe day of Pentecost has often been described as the reversal of Babel, but close comparison shows this is not the case. Pentecost involves not so much the reversal of Babel as its redemption. Reversing Babel would mean that speakers returned to speaking a single language or hearers returned to hearing a single language. But that is not what happened. At Pentecost speakers talked and listeners heard in a great variety of languages (not in fact in ecstatic tongues) - Acts 2 indicates no fewer than thirteen. The languages remained different but they were understood. Peter then stood up and preached to the crowd, however, presumably in a single language, and communicated well enough for them to be \u2018cut to the heart\u2019. The multiplicity of languages at Pentecost were not given primarily as a matter of communication, then, but of identity . Acts 2 characterizes the languages three times as the listeners\u2019 mother tongues - the languages they grew up in, the languages they were born in, the languages they were at home in. The coming of the Spirit was marked by an affirmation of their identities and of the diverse languages and cultures in which these \u2018devout Jews from every nation under heaven\u2019 were at home.\n\nThere is, however, one sense in which the effect of Babel was reversed at Pentecost if not the phenomenon itself. Peter\u2019s sermon was preached in a lingua franca, an imperial language \u2013 probably Greek, possibly Aramaic. The spread and inheritance of languages of empire meant that diverse and scattered audiences were all able to understand a single tongue. This gave Jesus his probable mother tongue (Aramaic), and the universality of Greek enabled the wide preaching of the early church and the spread and preservation of the New Testament writings. What happened at Pentecost was in some way the best of both worlds linguistically, affirming both identity through community languages and communication through a shared lingua franca.\n\nI would suggest that, with Hymes and Bakhtin, we seek not only amelioration of people\u2019s linguistic conditions but address the foundations of linguistic discrimination and inequity. Linguistic justice promotes the speaking and hearing of marginalized and stifled voices. Such commitments were often the prime drivers that motivated the founders of the field of sociolinguistics, and they have continued to spur my own and successive generations of sociolinguistic scholars \u2013 many of them Christians.\n\nIt is the role of such a sociolinguistics to \u2018give voice\u2019. This includes giving voice to ourselves, but saliently it also stresses the need to enable the voices of others. To accept someone\u2019s voice is to accept them; to reject someone\u2019s voice, rejects them. If we can give voice, we can also take voice away. We can disable the voices of others through not listening to them or by drowning them out. Or we can \u2018give ear\u2019 to what the socially marginalized are saying. I know that my country has a particular responsibility to M\u0101ori and Pasifika voices, and other nations have their own parallel situations. For this we need a politics of voice, which celebrates the profusion of voices, and which is committed to a just hearing for all those. Such staunch and adept listenership is one hallmark of a just and Christian approach to language in society: \u2018Those who have ears to hear, let them hear\u2019.\n\nBakhtin, M. M. 1986.

After defeating the tribe of Ephraim in battle, the Gileadites waited for the fleeing Ephraimites at the River Jordan:</p>\n<blockquote><p>Whenever one of the fugitives of Ephraim said, \u2018Let me go over\u2019, the men of Gilead would say to him, \u2018Are you an Ephraimite?\u2019 When he said, \u2018No\u2019, they said to him, \u2018Then say Shibboleth\u2019, and he said, \u2018Sibboleth\u2019, for he could not pronounce it right. Then they seized him and killed him at the fords of the Jordan. (NRSV)</p></blockquote>\n<p>Whenever one of the fugitives of Ephraim said, \u2018Let me go over\u2019, the men of Gilead would say to him, \u2018Are you an Ephraimite?\u2019 When he said, \u2018No\u2019, they said to him, \u2018Then say Shibboleth\u2019, and he said, \u2018Sibboleth\u2019, for he could not pronounce it right. Then they seized him and killed him at the fords of the Jordan. (NRSV)</p>\n<p>The word <em>shibboleth </em>has been<em> </em>carried into English to mean precisely a language feature which is identified with a group.</p>\n<h3>Erasure</h3>\n<p>If what you speak is not recognized as a language, your voice may be denigrated or ignored, you will likely be subject to linguistic injustice. Hungarian speakers in Romania, for example, believe their speech is inferior to that spoken in Hungary. In countless countries, minority-group children have been punished for speaking their home language at school. These evaluations represent the belief that one linguistic form or code is better or worse than another. It sounds more beautiful or more ugly, is superior or inferior, is more or less moral. This forms the basis for linguistic injustice. We place people socially by the way they talk. As George Bernard Shaw wrote in the preface to his play <em>Pygmalion</em>, words later paraphrased into one of the songs of <em>My Fair Lady:</em></p>\n<blockquote><p>An Englishman\u2019s way of speaking absolutely classifies him, The moment he talks he makes some other Englishman despise him.</p></blockquote>\n<p>An Englishman\u2019s way of speaking absolutely classifies him, The moment he talks he makes some other Englishman despise him.</p>\n<p>In the United States, mental mapping studies of dialect regions show that the dialects which are the most salient to Americans are precisely the ones that they despise \u2013 those of New York City and the South. Denigration of other people\u2019s accents is widespread, and its saddest outcome is how often it is reflected in speakers also downgrading their own accent.</p>\n<h3>Jesus and Linguistic Discrimination</h3>\n<p>Jesus was also probably subject to linguistic denigration. We know that Galilee was regarded as a cultural backwater by the Jerusalem elite \u2013 reflected in Nathaniel\u2019s rhetorical question, \u2018Can anything good come out of Nazareth?\u2019 (John 1: 46). From the Gospels, we also know how distinctive was the Galilean accent (presumably of Aramaic), because it gave Peter away as he hovered on the edges of Jesus\u2019 trial (Matthew 26: 73). We can assume that Jesus had a similar accent to Peter\u2019s, so the Jerusalem rulers\u2019 hostility was probably not just to what Jesus said but to how he said it. His voice was \u2018despised and rejected\u2019.</p>\n<h2>Language as a site of struggle</h2>\n<p>The Russian thinker Mikhail Bakhtin, an unorthodox Orthodox Christian of the early 20<sup>th</sup> century, maintained that language is a site of struggle between the dynamic centrifugal forces which whirl it apart into diversity, and the hegemonic centripetal forces which strive to standardize and prescribe the way language should be. He celebrates the centrifugal - the divergence, individuality, creativity, even the chaos of language variety.</p>\n<h3>Standard languages</h3>\n<p>Language standardization through the education system is a primary site of linguistic injustice. Even the world\u2019s best-known standard accent - British Received Pronunciation (\u2018the Queen\u2019s English/BBC English\u2019) - is a relatively recent invention: before the mid-18<sup>th</sup> century there was no sense of a standard pronunciation for English. Still nowadays only a small minority of the British population can speak this standard. French is arguably the world\u2019s most standardized language, since the founding of the Acad\u00e9mie Fran\u00e7aise in the 17<sup>th</sup> century. As the sociologist Pierre Bourdieu has theorized, using the standard gives its speaker linguistic capital . Even French encompasses a large range of variety that is ignored in defining what the standard is, to the point of excluding the idea that variety even exists.</p>\n<p>If speaking the standard is a social advantage, then lacking it will be a disadvantage. The unavoidable outcome of language standardization is inequity, certainly for some, often for the many. The routine companion of linguistic disadvantage is economic and social disadvantage, whether that be for Moroccans in France, northerners in England, Quechua speakers in Peru, or African Americans. If the \u2018best people\u2019 speak in a certain way, you will not become one of the best people without their speech. In his preface to the manual <em>Rhyming Roadways to Good Speech</em> (1940), Professor F. Sinclaire of Canterbury University College, New Zealand, wrote:</p>\n<blockquote><p>Debased speech \u2013 it cannot too strongly be insisted \u2013 is a symptom of general cultural debasement, of growing insensibility to values which lie at the very roots of all culture. Someone has said that people who talk through the nose will think through the nose. It is certain that if we speak badly we shall think badly and feel coarsely.</p><p class=\"text-align-right\">Quoted in Gordon &amp; Abell (1990: 30)</p></blockquote>\n<p>Debased speech \u2013 it cannot too strongly be insisted \u2013 is a symptom of general cultural debasement, of growing insensibility to values which lie at the very roots of all culture. Someone has said that people who talk through the nose will think through the nose. It is certain that if we speak badly we shall think badly and feel coarsely.</p>\n<p class=\"text-align-right\">Quoted in Gordon &amp; Abell (1990: 30)</p>\n<h3>Vernacular versus standard</h3>\n<p>However, local and subcultural groups create and maintain countervailing linguistic norms which are defiantly oppositional to the standard. The vernacular \u2013 rather, \u2018vernaculars\u2019, always pluralized - is immensely more variegated than the standard, and is the usual locus of linguistic innovation and creativity. Shared local networks and practices serve as vernacular maintenance mechanisms with their own powers of persuasion and conformity in the face of institutional propagation of the standard. Most people accept the standard as natural, normal, commonsense, eliding the often conflictual socioeconomic and sociolinguistic realities. But on the basis of speech, people \u2013 including academics - have been prepared to make large social and personal judgments.</p>\n<h2>Babel and Pentecost</h2>\n<p>The stabilizing, centralizing impetus of linguistic standard and convention is in tension with the decentralizing, momentary, creative use of language. The centrifugal forces are always spinning new words, new dialects, new languages, new voices, regardless of all efforts to the contrary by academies, educators, politicians or pedants. However, the belief that monolingualism is natural and that multilingualism is a curse is deeply embedded in western consciousness, and it is the Bible that has provided the leading image and narrative of this in the cultural memory of the West.</p>\n<h3>Babel</h3>\n<p>The story in Genesis 11 is usually interpreted as a condemnation of language diversity, and is still enormously influential and productive. But there is an alternative reading available for the narrative: that the judgment of Babel promoted the spread of humankind and the rich diversification of its languages. The fault of Babel was not pride but a refusal to disperse and \u2018fill the earth\u2019 as mandated at creation and after the flood. In Bell (2011) I argue that Babel is a blessing rather than a curse, adopting the interpretation proposed by Walter Brueggemann (1982). Babel is in this reading a charter for linguistic variety, a manifesto for multilingualism rather than a lament for lost monolingualism.</p>\n<p>There is a close link between this view of Babel and Bakhtin\u2019s centrifugal forces in language change. Babel is in part a story about linguistic power, about the social and political meanings of monolingualism and multilingualism. As indicated earlier, the European nation-state was created with the assumption that a nation should have its own single language. Such monolingualism is routinely coercive against other languages. Babel stands as a monument to the ultimate futility of the drive to enforce monolingualism.</p>\n<h3>Pentecost</h3>\n<p>The day of Pentecost has often been described as the reversal of Babel, but close comparison shows this is not the case. Pentecost involves not so much the reversal of Babel as its redemption. Reversing Babel would mean that speakers returned to speaking a single language or hearers returned to hearing a single language. But that is not what happened. At Pentecost speakers talked and listeners heard in a great variety of languages (not in fact in ecstatic tongues) - Acts 2 indicates no fewer than thirteen. The languages remained different but they were understood. Peter then stood up and preached to the crowd, however, presumably in a single language, and communicated well enough for them to be \u2018cut to the heart\u2019. The multiplicity of languages at Pentecost were not given primarily as a matter of communication, then, but of <em>identity</em>. Acts 2 characterizes the languages three times as the listeners\u2019 mother tongues - the languages they grew up in, the languages they were born in, the languages they were at home in. The coming of the Spirit was marked by an affirmation of their identities and of the diverse languages and cultures in which these \u2018devout Jews from every nation under heaven\u2019 were at home.</p>\n<p>There is, however, one sense in which the effect of Babel was reversed at Pentecost if not the phenomenon itself. Peter\u2019s sermon was preached in a lingua franca, an imperial language \u2013 probably Greek, possibly Aramaic. The spread and inheritance of languages of empire meant that diverse and scattered audiences were all able to understand a single tongue. This gave Jesus his probable mother tongue (Aramaic), and the universality of Greek enabled the wide preaching of the early church and the spread and preservation of the New Testament writings. What happened at Pentecost was in some way the best of both worlds linguistically, affirming both identity through community languages and communication through a shared lingua franca.</p>\n<h2>The profusion of voices</h2>\n<p>I would suggest that, with Hymes and Bakhtin, we seek not only amelioration of people\u2019s linguistic conditions but address the foundations of linguistic discrimination and inequity. Linguistic justice promotes the speaking and hearing of marginalized and stifled voices. Such commitments were often the prime drivers that motivated the founders of the field of sociolinguistics, and they have continued to spur my own and successive generations of sociolinguistic scholars \u2013 many of them Christians.</p>\n<p>It is the role of such a sociolinguistics to \u2018give voice\u2019. This includes giving voice to ourselves, but saliently it also stresses the need to enable the voices of others. To accept someone\u2019s voice is to accept them; to reject someone\u2019s voice, rejects them. If we can give voice, we can also take voice away. We can disable the voices of others through not listening to them or by drowning them out. Or we can \u2018give ear\u2019 to what the socially marginalized are saying. I know that my country has a particular responsibility to M\u0101ori and Pasifika voices, and other nations have their own parallel situations. For this we need a politics of voice, which celebrates the profusion of voices, and which is committed to a just hearing for all those. Such staunch and adept listenership is one hallmark of a just and Christian approach to language in society: \u2018Those who have ears to hear, let them hear\u2019.</p>\n<h2 class=\"new_page\">References</h2>\n<p class=\"reference\">Bakhtin, M.

    "bodyText": "Professor Wolterstorff\u2019s lucid and perceptive account of a Christian conception of justice and rights provides an excellent framework for locating the distinctive concerns of restorative justice theory and practice, as well as for helping navigate some of the current debates in the field, especially around the appropriate boundaries and scope of restorative justice. Particularly helpful is his distinction between \u201cfirst order\u201d and \u201csecond order\u201d justice, for it serves to reinforce the central principle of restorative justice \u2013 namely, that justice interventions following criminal or similarly harmful episodes should not be thought of, or restricted to, retributive punishments, reprimands or censures aimed at publicly marking the wrong done and upholding the norms of society. Rather they should be understood, more fundamentally, as second-order attempts to restore first-order justice in its holistic sense, to make things right again and open up a new future for the participants. This, after all, is how divine justice typically functions in Scripture. [\u00a01\u00a0]\n\nIn a moment, I will offer a detailed explanation of what the term \u201crestorative justice\u201d refers to. But, by way of introduction, typically it describes a facilitated, face-to-face dialogue between victims and offenders that aims to explore the actual harm perpetrated by the offending and to determine what should be done practically to demonstrate accountability for the harm done and to promote healing and repair. [\u00a02\u00a0] It is a voluntary and flexible process that enables the participants to encounter each other is full and complex human beings, not simply as legal ciphers, and to focus on what is needed for their personal and relational recovery. It turns on the premise, memorably expressed by John Braithwaite, that \u201cbecause crime wounds, justice must heal, as long as justice is understood relationally\u201d. [\u00a03\u00a0] Though not intended as a theological observation (Braithwaite is a secular theorist), it is hard to miss its resonance with the key biblical texts and themes cited by Wolterstorff.\n\nThe ease with which it is possible, at least for me, to build connections between Wolterstorff\u2019s framework and restorative justice is because of the formative role biblical notions of justice and reconciliation \u2013 mediated through the beliefs and practices of the Anabaptist peace church tradition \u2013 played in the emergence of the modern restorative justice movement in the early 1970s. This theological contribution is often misunderstood or minimized or completely elided from secular accounts of the origin and distinctive features of the movement. But it is surely significant that the earliest architects of restorative justice theory and practice were Christian peace activists intentionally striving to put their spiritual and ethical beliefs into practice in the public arena. One might even say that the biblically informed theology of peace and justice to which they subscribed served as midwife at the birth of restorative justice in the modern era and without the influence of such core Christian values and beliefs, the central tenets of restorative theory might not have emerged with such clarity and conviction. [\u00a04\u00a0]\n\nThis is not to say that Christianity can claim exclusive proprietary rights to the restorative justice ideal. There are precedents and parallels in other cultural and religious traditions as well. Moreover, as the modern restorative justice movement has grown and spread, it has been molded by a wide array of influences and disciplinary interests, ranging from indigenous dispute resolution practices to the feminist ethics of care, from relational sociology and positive psychology to affect theory, organizational psychology and the insights of modern neuroscience. Instead of a single taproot sinking ever deeper into its theological point of origin, the restorative seed sprouted a fibrous or tangled root system, fanning out in all directions to draw sustenance from sundry sources of knowledge and experience. This has given restorative justice since its inception a dynamic or synthetic quality, which remains a singular strength.\n\nYet notwithstanding its heterogeneous character, the first people to articulate modern restorative justice philosophy and practice did so in the context of a particular Christian faith tradition, guided by distinctive theological beliefs and commitments. Arguably the legacy of this influence is evident in the emphasis placed on accountability, relational repair and human transformation that characterizes much of the wider contemporary restorative movement.\n\nIt is also evident, I believe, in the congruence that exists between restorative justice and indigenous ways of seeing the world. There are clear resemblances between restorative justice processes and the mechanisms used in traditional societies for addressing harm and restoring balance, and not a few observers have attributed the emergence of restorative justice directly to the inspiration of indigenous ways of doing justice, especially in North America and New Zealand. The truth is more complex than that. But the striking similarity or overlap between the two approaches could be explained in terms of the overt role given to spiritual values and beliefs in first shaping restorative justice.\n\nIn both biblical and indigenous worldviews, there is an instinctive recognition that doing justice in the face of transgression is a deeply spiritual undertaking. It is not simply a matter of assessing facts, determining blame, and allocating penalties. It is also about addressing the loss of what M\u0101ori of New Zealand call mana or spiritual dignity caused by the offence, a lifting of the shame inflicted, a repairing of the rupture caused to the fabric of the community, a cleansing of the land from impurity, and a restoring of order and balance to the cosmic domain which interconnects all things. While such numinous convictions are largely foreign to the modern secular mind, they are by no means foreign to the Bible or to the biblical conception of justice that inspired the first pioneers of restorative justice.\n\nWolterstorff explains that there is a fundamental distinction between the kind of justice that orders the way everyday life functions in society, and the justice that applies when there has been a substantial failure to act justly requiring a corrective response. However, the traditional terms philosophers use for these two forms of justice \u2013 distributive justice and retributive justice \u2013 he considers to be unsatisfactory, partly because neither \u201cdistribution\u201d or \u201cretribution\u201d adequately captures the full range of what each sphere entails. Instead, he coins the concept of \u201cfirst-order justice\u201d to describe the type of justice that consists of agents acting justly in their ordinary affairs and \u201csecond order justice\u201d to refer to just ways of responding to violations of first order justice, whether those violations take the form of interpersonal wrongdoing or social injustice.\n\nBiblical terms for conveying first-order justice include righteousness, which describes right-living in its broadest sense, and peace or shalom, which describes a flourishing in all the dimensions of our relational existence: with God, with one\u2019s fellow human beings, with the environment and with one\u2019s own self. Biblical terminology for second-order justice includes the language of judgment, justice and justification (or righteousness-restoring action).\n\nWhen people today hear the word \u201cjustice\u201d, they usually take it to refer to second-order interventions (involving the police, courts, prisons, punishments, and so on). But first-order justice, Wolterstorff notes, is structurally more basic, for \u201cif there were no such thing as first-order justice and injustice, there would be no such things as second-order justice and injustices\u201d. Accordingly, \u201conly if one understands first-order justice can one understand second-order justice\u201d. I take this to mean both that (i) second-order actions presuppose a normative understanding of how things ought to be in our personal and social relationships and (ii) that in responding to violations of that normative order, justice responses should aspire to restore a just ordering of affairs and relationships. This is where restorative justice has something important and distinctive to offer.\n\nWhile there is no universally agreed definition of restorative justice, and the legitimate scope of its application is widely debated today, there remains something recognizably distinctive about a restorative way of construing and addressing personal and social harms, something that sets it apart from the more familiar retributive or therapeutic ways of doing so. This distinctiveness lies, in my view, in its peculiar combination of values, processes, and intended outcomes. This threefold combination means that the most helpful way to attempt to define or capture the meaning of restorative justice is to ensure that all three components are included in the formulation. My attempt to do so is as follows:\n\nRestorative justice involves a voluntary, relational process whereby those with a personal stake in an offence or conflict or injustice come together, in a safe and respectful environment, with the help of skilled facilitators, to speak truthfully about what happened and its impact on their lives, to clarify accountability for the harms that have occurred, and to resolve together how best to promote repair and bring about positive changes for all involved.\n\nEach element of this definition requires further elaboration, but importantly the definition incorporates the distinctive process of restorative justice (a facilitated dialogue between those directly involved in harmful events), its undergirding relational values (including freedom of choice, respect, truthfulness, accountability, and equal concern), and the envisioned goals or outcomes of the practice (the clarification of what happened in the past and its impact, and collaborative decision-making about how best to promote repair and achieve positive changes in the future for all involved). This integration of values, processes, and goals is sometimes expressed as a series of foundational principles, and while there is no unanimity on how best to define restorative justice, there is a broad agreement on its core principles.\n\nThe first person to use the term \u201crestorative justice\u201d to describe this way of addressing crime was Mennonite criminal justice historian and activist Dr Howard Zehr, in the early 1980s. The suitability of the label has not been without its critics, however. Many object to the adjective \u201crestorative\u201d, since it seems to imply an attempt to recover some prior state of equilibrium or harmony, as though the clock can be turned back and the past retrieved. But there are some losses that can never be made good, such as the loss of a life, and there are many situations in which seeking to reinstate the past would serve to entrench systemic injustices or power imbalances that need to be challenged and changed, not restored.\n\nOthers object to the perceived narrowness of the term \u201cjustice\u201d and its binary, and often arbitrary, distinction between victims and offenders. To achieve real justice, they insist, requires more than inserting a new procedure into the existing retributive system and its controlling assumptions. The entire system requires transforming, and the values, principles and practices undergirding the restorative justice need to be applied across the full range of social and institutional life.\n\nDespite such misgivings, the name restorative justice has stuck. It has resonated with people all over the world, possibly because it suggests that justice is about achieving concrete change. Justice is not about upholding abstract principles or legal doctrines or human rights standards or moral codes or metaphysical beliefs. True justice changes things on the ground: it rectifies past wrongs, repairs present harms, and restores wellbeing and future safety. Or, to use Wolterstorff\u2019s language, it aspires to establish or re-establish first-order justice in which people treat each other with the respect and dignity they are due, both as fellow citizens and fellow human beings.\n\nUnlike many Christian thinkers today, Wolterstorff sees great merit in using the language of \u201crights\u201d to explicate the demands of justice. He notes that while Christian critics of rights talk often protest that it stems from the eighteenth century Enlightenment and serves to undergird modern secular individualism, its seedbed, in fact, can be traced back to medieval Christendom, which in turn, one might add, was influenced by biblical convictions about human dignity and the nature of covenantal relationships. [\u00a05\u00a0] He then draws a basic distinction between externally conferred rights (including those conferred by the law) and intrinsically non-conferred rights (those which stem from being the sort of creature the rights-bearer is). Justice entails respecting these rights. It involves recognising the intrinsic worth of the rights bearer and rendering them what is their rightful due. Injustice involves a failure to respect the dignity and morally legitimate rights of others. Once again these considerations can help elucidate the work of restorative justice.\n\nIn the growing number of jurisdictions that recognise and employ restorative justice processes, they typically operate within the constraints and protections imposed by the wider justice system. Amongst other things, this helps ensure that the participants\u2019 conferred legal rights are safeguarded. While some critics have claimed that restorative justice undermines due process and erodes respect for the rule of law, there is no empirical evidence to support that. Indeed research in New Zealand has shown that those who have participated in restorative justice often end up feeling more confident in the existing justice system than before, precisely because the system has allowed them the chance to address their psychological and emotional needs through a restorative process in a way the mainstream system cannot.\n\nEarlier I characterised restorative justice as a distinctive combination of values, processes, and outcomes. I also noted that the qualification \u201crestorative\u201d often creates misunderstanding because some take it to imply an attempt to reinstate the past, which is neither possible (people are forever changed by the harmful event they have experienced), nor desirable (past arrangements may have been unhealthy or unjust). While some jettison the word for alternative designations, like relational justice or transformative justice or non-adversarial justice, there is good reason to retain the term restorative because, properly understood, it illuminates all three components that make restorative justice distinctive.\n\nIn terms of values , restorative justice seeks to restore respect, dignity and peace to relationships that have been damaged by wrongdoing. To be the object of intentional malice is often experienced by victims as a fundamental act of disrespect, a failure to value the sufferer\u2019s intrinsic worth, identity, legitimate rights and feelings, as though these things don\u2019t really matter. Such disrespect can only be remedied by a restoration of respect, by a clear acknowledgement on the part of the person responsible for the contemptuous behaviour that the victim did not deserve to be treated as they were and that their rights, feelings and interests do indeed matter, every bit as much as their own. It is often said that \u201crespect\u201d is the primary restorative justice value and the key to its transformative power.\n\nIn terms of process, restorative justice restores agency, ownership, and decision-making power to those directly affected by the harmful event \u2013 victims, offenders, their families and supporters, and the wider community. Victimization is also commonly experienced as a form of disempowerment, a loss of control over one\u2019s life and security and a disconnection from those who have failed to provide protection or care. This feeling of disempowerment is often exacerbated by participation in the criminal trial process over which victims have no control and that renders them passive spectators on their own suffering. A similar disempowerment is experienced by defendants, whose case is presented on their behalf by paid advocates and who passively await the trial\u2019s outcome of verdict and sentencing. By contrast, rather than deferring all responsibility to the state or to legal professionals, restorative justice aims to restore instrumental power to the immediate participants in resolving the harm.\n\nIn terms of outcomes , by striving to repair the harms caused by the crime, restorative justice seeks to restore wellbeing to the individuals affected and to restore the relationship between them to a just condition. Both goals are crucial and inseparable. Individual wellbeing is promoted by trying to meet the needs of moral repair, such as having one\u2019s voice heard, one\u2019s experience validated, one\u2019s story verified, one\u2019s integrity or innocence vindicated, and one\u2019s intrinsic value affirmed. Yet because human beings are irreducibly relational creatures, as the biblical creation stories affirm, none of this can happen apart from restoring the relationship between the parties to a just condition, that is to a condition in which both sides recognize the rights, dignity and legitimate interests of the other.\n\nTo speak of relational restoration in this connection does not necessarily imply the reconciliation of formerly estranged parties: the participants may not have known each other before the event occurred. Nor does it mean the advent of personal warmth or intimacy between them in the future: the two parties may agree never to see each other again. Rather it means that the nature of the relationship between them, as fellow citizens and fellow human beings, as well as co-participants in the harmful episode, is restored to a rightful state , that is, to one marked by equality of concern, dignity, freedom from deceit or coercion, and at least minimal social trust.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s no accident\u201d, Wolterstorff writes, \u201cthat all the great social justice movements of the twentieth century, struggling against one or another form of systemic injustice, employed the language of rights: women\u2019s rights, labor rights, civil rights, on and on\u201d. Another example is the victims\u2019 rights movement, which emerged in the 1970s, and which has contributed to the shaping of restorative justice agenda over the past 50 years. Other social change movements have also done so. But even more significant is the way restorative justice itself has grown into a global social change movement.\n\nInitially the concept of restorative justice was used solely with respect to criminal justice concerns, and there are still theorists and practitioners who insist the phrase should only be used for responses to criminalizable actions. But the semantic field of the term has expanded considerably over recent years and now includes a range of discursive and peace-making practices beyond the criminal justice system as well \u2013 in schools, families, workplaces, human services providers, voluntary associations, community groups, businesses, governance bodies, and regulatory agencies.\n\nAs a result of this expanded field of application, it has become routine in the literature to speak not only of restorative justice but also of restorative practices , restorative organizations , restorative communities, restorative regulatory systems, restorative leadership , even of restorative cities and restorative societies, and to view them as different faces of the same diamond, as varied applications of the same values, principles, and relational philosophy, as distinct manifestations of a grander social movement for a more inclusive, peaceful, and participatory democracy.\n\nOn this understanding, restorative justice is more than a novel approach to crime control or a new set of victim-sensitive justice practices. These things are but the tip of a very large iceberg, a project aimed at the creation of interpersonal relationships and societal institutions that conscientiously foster human dignity, equality, freedom, mutual respect, human rights, democratic participation and collaborative governance \u2013 or first-order justice.\n\nAlthough some criminal justice advocates complain that restorative justice is losing its precision and focus by being identified with a wide range of peacemaking practices, others regard this snowballing effect as a logical and positive consequence of its undergirding ideals, values and principles. Arguably the comprehensiveness of this larger restorative vision was encoded in the DNA of the approach, for it calls to mind the biblical notion of shalom that directly informed the first experiments in victim-offender reconciliation.\n\nAs noted earlier, shalom in the Bible means more than the absence of conflict and violence. Rather it denotes the positive presence of harmony and wholeness, of health and prosperity, of integration and balance. It is a state of soundness and flourishing in all the dimensions of one\u2019s existence \u2013 in one\u2019s relationship with God, with others in society, with the wider created order, and with one\u2019s own self. Shalom is where everything is as it ought to be, a condition of \u201call-rightness\u201d in every department of life. It thus combines in one concept the meaning of both justice and peace, which are inseparable ingredients of first-order justice.\n\nThis all-encompassing biblical concept of shalom had a hugely formative role in shaping the original vision and practice of restorative justice. But as restorative justice has become increasingly secularized and institutionalized as simply an additional therapeutic practice bolted on to the existing criminal justice system, the larger vision of seeking shalom has steadily declined.\n\nCarolyn Boyes-Watson makes a similar point in her recent account of the origins and future of restorative justice. She expresses extreme pessimism about the future of restorative justice as a technocratic or managerial solution to the inadequacies of current criminal justice system, as is currently favoured by legislators and policymakers. She is much more optimistic, however, about its future in the new wave of restorative justice activism that is engaging with issues of oppression, discrimination, economic injustice, and environmental abuse. Here there is no separation between politics and ethics, between justice and spirituality, head-thinking and heart-thinking, individual transformation and societal change. The goal is not just to resolve individual conflicts over past harms but to build an all-embracing and enduring just peace.\n\nBoyes-Watson traces this holistic aspiration back to the unifying vision of shalom and to the \u201cessentially spiritual and ethical understandings of \u2018right relationship\u2019\u201d that Howard Zehr originally identified as the touchstones of the restorative justice paradigm, as well as to the movement\u2019s original goal of building the \u201cbeloved community\u201d, not simply of forging a more efficient and effective criminal justice system.

    "bodyHtml": "<p>Professor Wolterstorff\u2019s lucid and perceptive account of a Christian conception of justice and rights provides an excellent framework for locating the distinctive concerns of restorative justice theory and practice, as well as for helping navigate some of the current debates in the field, especially around the appropriate boundaries and scope of restorative justice. Particularly helpful is his distinction between \u201cfirst order\u201d and \u201csecond order\u201d justice, for it serves to reinforce the central principle of restorative justice \u2013 namely, that justice interventions following criminal or similarly harmful episodes should not be thought of, or restricted to, retributive punishments, reprimands or censures aimed at publicly marking the wrong done and upholding the norms of society. Rather they should be understood, more fundamentally, as second-order attempts to\u00a0<i>restore\u00a0</i>first-order justice in its holistic sense, to make things right again and open up a new future for the participants. This, after all, is how divine justice typically functions in Scripture.<a class=\"anchor\" id=\"content100note1anc\" name=\"content100note1anc\">\u00a0</a><a class=\"note\" href=\"#content100note1sym\">[\u00a01\u00a0]</a></p>\n<p>In a moment, I will offer a detailed explanation of what the term \u201crestorative justice\u201d refers to. But, by way of introduction, typically it describes a facilitated, face-to-face dialogue between victims and offenders that aims to explore the actual harm perpetrated by the offending and to determine what should be done practically to demonstrate accountability for the harm done and to promote healing and repair.<a class=\"anchor\" id=\"content100note2anc\" name=\"content100note2anc\">\u00a0</a><a class=\"note\" href=\"#content100note2sym\">[\u00a02\u00a0]</a> It is a voluntary and flexible process that enables the participants to encounter each other is full and complex human beings, not simply as legal ciphers, and to focus on what is needed for their personal and relational recovery. It turns on the premise, memorably expressed by John Braithwaite, that \u201cbecause crime wounds, justice must heal, as long as justice is understood relationally\u201d.<a class=\"anchor\" id=\"content100note3anc\" name=\"content100note3anc\">\u00a0</a><a class=\"note\" href=\"#content100note3sym\">[\u00a03\u00a0]</a> Though not intended as a theological observation (Braithwaite is a secular theorist), it is hard to miss its resonance with the key biblical texts and themes cited by Wolterstorff.</p>\n<h3>Christian Origins</h3>\n<p>The ease with which it is possible, at least for me, to build connections between Wolterstorff\u2019s framework and restorative justice is because of the formative role biblical notions of justice and reconciliation \u2013 mediated through the beliefs and practices of the Anabaptist peace church tradition \u2013 played in the emergence of the modern restorative justice movement in the early 1970s. This theological contribution is often misunderstood or minimized or completely elided from secular accounts of the origin and distinctive features of the movement. But it is surely significant that the earliest architects of restorative justice theory and practice were Christian peace activists intentionally striving to put their spiritual and ethical beliefs into practice in the public arena. One might even say that the biblically informed theology of peace and justice to which they subscribed served as midwife at the birth of restorative justice in the modern era and without the influence of such core Christian values and beliefs, the central tenets of restorative theory might not have emerged with such clarity and conviction.<a class=\"anchor\" id=\"content100note4anc\" name=\"content100note4anc\">\u00a0</a><a class=\"note\" href=\"#content100note4sym\">[\u00a04\u00a0]</a></p>\n<p>This is not to say that Christianity can claim exclusive proprietary rights to the restorative justice ideal. There are precedents and parallels in other cultural and religious traditions as well. Moreover, as the modern restorative justice movement has grown and spread, it has been molded by a wide array of influences and disciplinary interests, ranging from indigenous dispute resolution practices to the feminist ethics of care, from relational sociology and positive psychology to affect theory, organizational psychology and the insights of modern neuroscience. Instead of a single taproot sinking ever deeper into its theological point of origin, the restorative seed sprouted a fibrous or tangled root system, fanning out in all directions to draw sustenance from sundry sources of knowledge and experience. This has given restorative justice since its inception a dynamic or synthetic quality, which remains a singular strength.</p>\n<p>Yet notwithstanding its heterogeneous character, the first people to articulate modern restorative justice philosophy and practice did so in the context of a particular Christian faith tradition, guided by distinctive theological beliefs and commitments. Arguably the legacy of this influence is evident in the emphasis placed on accountability, relational repair and human transformation that characterizes much of the wider contemporary restorative movement.</p>\n<h3>Indigenous Worldviews</h3>\n<p>It is also evident, I believe, in the congruence that exists between restorative justice and indigenous ways of seeing the world. There are clear resemblances between restorative justice processes and the mechanisms used in traditional societies for addressing harm and restoring balance, and not a few observers have attributed the emergence of restorative justice directly to the inspiration of indigenous ways of doing justice, especially in North America and New Zealand. The truth is more complex than that. But the striking similarity or overlap between the two approaches could be explained in terms of the overt role given to spiritual values and beliefs in first shaping restorative justice.</p>\n<p>In both biblical and indigenous worldviews, there is an instinctive recognition that doing justice in the face of transgression is a deeply spiritual undertaking. It is not simply a matter of assessing facts, determining blame, and allocating penalties. It is also about addressing the loss of what M\u0101ori of New Zealand call <i>mana</i> or spiritual dignity caused by the offence, a lifting of the shame inflicted, a repairing of the rupture caused to the fabric of the community, a cleansing of the land from impurity, and a restoring of order and balance to the cosmic domain which interconnects all things. While such numinous convictions are largely foreign to the modern secular mind, they are by no means foreign to the Bible or to the biblical conception of justice that inspired the first pioneers of restorative justice.</p>\n<h2>Two Orders of Justice</h2>\n<p>Wolterstorff explains that there is a fundamental distinction between the kind of justice that orders the way everyday life functions in society, and the justice that applies when there has been a substantial failure to act justly requiring a corrective response. However, the traditional terms philosophers use for these two forms of justice \u2013 distributive justice and retributive justice \u2013 he considers to be unsatisfactory, partly because neither \u201cdistribution\u201d or \u201cretribution\u201d adequately captures the full range of what each sphere entails. Instead, he coins the concept of \u201cfirst-order justice\u201d to describe the type of justice that consists of agents acting justly in their ordinary affairs and \u201csecond order justice\u201d to refer to just ways of responding to violations of first order justice, whether those violations take the form of interpersonal wrongdoing or social injustice.</p>\n<p>Biblical terms for conveying first-order justice include <i>righteousness, </i>which describes right-living in its broadest sense, and peace or <i>shalom, </i>which describes a flourishing in all the dimensions of our relational existence: with God, with one\u2019s fellow human beings, with the environment and with one\u2019s own self. Biblical terminology for second-order justice includes the language of <i>judgment, justice</i> and <i>justification</i> (or righteousness-restoring action).</p>\n<p>When people today hear the word \u201cjustice\u201d, they usually take it to refer to second-order interventions (involving the police, courts, prisons, punishments, and so on). But first-order justice, Wolterstorff notes, is structurally more basic, for \u201cif there were no such thing as first-order justice and injustice, there would be no such things as second-order justice and injustices\u201d. Accordingly, \u201conly if one understands first-order justice can one understand second-order justice\u201d. I take this to mean both that (i) second-order actions presuppose a normative understanding of how things <i>ought</i> to be in our personal and social relationships and (ii) that in responding to violations of that normative order, justice responses should aspire to restore a just ordering of affairs and relationships. This is where restorative justice has something important and distinctive to offer.</p>\n<h2><b>Why \u201cRestorative\u201d Justice? </b></h2>\n<p>While there is no universally agreed definition of restorative justice, and the legitimate scope of its application is widely debated today, there remains something recognizably distinctive about a <i>restorative</i> way of construing and addressing personal and social harms, something that sets it apart from the more familiar retributive or therapeutic ways of doing so. This distinctiveness lies, in my view, in its peculiar <i>combination </i>of values, processes, and intended outcomes. This threefold combination means that the most helpful way to attempt to define or capture the meaning of restorative justice is to ensure that all three components are included in the formulation. My attempt to do so is as follows:</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>Restorative justice involves a voluntary, relational process whereby those with a personal stake in an offence or conflict or injustice come together, in a safe and respectful environment, with the help of skilled facilitators, to speak truthfully about what happened and its impact on their lives, to clarify accountability for the harms that have occurred, and to resolve together how best to promote repair and bring about positive changes for all involved.</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>Restorative justice involves a voluntary, relational process whereby those with a personal stake in an offence or conflict or injustice come together, in a safe and respectful environment, with the help of skilled facilitators, to speak truthfully about what happened and its impact on their lives, to clarify accountability for the harms that have occurred, and to resolve together how best to promote repair and bring about positive changes for all involved.</p>\n<p>Each element of this definition requires further elaboration, but importantly the definition incorporates the distinctive <i>process</i> of restorative justice (a facilitated dialogue between those directly involved in harmful events), its undergirding relational <i>values</i> (including freedom of choice, respect, truthfulness, accountability, and equal concern), and the envisioned goals or<i> outcomes</i> of the practice (the clarification of what happened in the past and its impact, and collaborative decision-making about how best to promote repair and achieve positive changes in the future for all involved). This integration of values, processes, and goals is sometimes expressed as a series of foundational principles, and while there is no unanimity on how best to define restorative justice, there is a broad agreement on its core principles.</p>\n<p>The first person to use the term \u201crestorative justice\u201d to describe this way of addressing crime was Mennonite criminal justice historian and activist Dr Howard Zehr, in the early 1980s. The suitability of the label has not been without its critics, however. Many object to the adjective \u201crestorative\u201d, since it seems to imply an attempt to recover some prior state of equilibrium or harmony, as though the clock can be turned back and the past retrieved. But there are some losses that can never be made good, such as the loss of a life, and there are many situations in which seeking to reinstate the past would serve to entrench systemic injustices or power imbalances that need to be challenged and changed, not restored.</p>\n<p>Others object to the perceived narrowness of the term \u201cjustice\u201d and its binary, and often arbitrary, distinction between victims and offenders. To achieve real justice, they insist, requires more than inserting a new procedure into the existing retributive system and its controlling assumptions. The entire system requires transforming, and the values, principles and practices undergirding the restorative justice need to be applied across the full range of social and institutional life.</p>\n<p>Despite such misgivings, the name restorative justice has stuck. It has resonated with people all over the world, possibly because it suggests that justice is about achieving concrete change. Justice is not about upholding abstract principles or legal doctrines or human rights standards or moral codes or metaphysical beliefs. True justice <i>changes</i> things on the ground: it <i>rectifies</i> past wrongs, <i>repairs</i> present harms, and <i>restores</i> wellbeing and future safety. Or, to use Wolterstorff\u2019s language, it aspires to establish or re-establish first-order justice in which people treat each other with the respect and dignity they are due, both as fellow citizens and fellow human beings.</p>\n<h2>Rights and Restorative Justice</h2>\n<p>Unlike many Christian thinkers today, Wolterstorff sees great merit in using the language of \u201crights\u201d to explicate the demands of justice. He notes that while Christian critics of rights talk often protest that it stems from the eighteenth century Enlightenment and serves to undergird modern secular individualism, its seedbed, in fact, can be traced back to medieval Christendom, which in turn, one might add, was influenced by biblical convictions about human dignity and the nature of covenantal relationships.<a class=\"anchor\" id=\"content100note5anc\" name=\"content100note5anc\">\u00a0</a><a class=\"note\" href=\"#content100note5sym\">[\u00a05\u00a0]</a> He then draws a basic distinction between externally <i>conferred</i> <i>rights</i> (including those conferred by the law) and intrinsically <i>non-conferred rights</i> (those which stem from being the sort of creature the rights-bearer is). Justice entails respecting these rights. It involves recognising the intrinsic worth of the rights bearer and rendering them what is their rightful due. Injustice involves a failure to respect the dignity and morally legitimate rights of others. Once again these considerations can help elucidate the work of restorative justice.</p>\n<p>In the growing number of jurisdictions that recognise and employ restorative justice processes, they typically operate within the constraints and protections imposed by the wider justice system. Amongst other things, this helps ensure that the participants\u2019 conferred legal rights are safeguarded. While some critics have claimed that restorative justice undermines due process and erodes respect for the rule of law, there is no empirical evidence to support that. Indeed research in New Zealand has shown that those who have participated in restorative justice often end up feeling more confident in the existing justice system than before, precisely because the system has allowed them the chance to address their psychological and emotional needs through a restorative process in a way the mainstream system cannot.</p>\n<p>Earlier I characterised restorative justice as a distinctive <i>combination</i> of values, processes, and outcomes. I also noted that the qualification \u201crestorative\u201d often creates misunderstanding because some take it to imply an attempt to reinstate the past, which is neither possible (people are forever changed by the harmful event they have experienced), nor desirable (past arrangements may have been unhealthy or unjust). While some jettison the word for alternative designations, like <i>relational</i> justice or <i>transformative</i> justice or <i>non-adversarial</i> justice, there is good reason to retain the term restorative because, properly understood, it illuminates all three components that make restorative justice distinctive.</p>\n<h3>Values</h3>\n<p>In terms of <i>values</i>, restorative justice seeks to restore respect, dignity and peace to relationships that have been damaged by wrongdoing. To be the object of intentional malice is often experienced by victims as a fundamental act of disrespect, a failure to value the sufferer\u2019s intrinsic worth, identity, legitimate rights and feelings, as though these things don\u2019t really matter. Such disrespect can only be remedied by a restoration of respect, by a clear acknowledgement on the part of the person responsible for the contemptuous behaviour that the victim did not deserve to be treated as they were and that their rights, feelings and interests <i>do</i> indeed matter, every bit as much as their own. It is often said that \u201crespect\u201d is the primary restorative justice value and the key to its transformative power.</p>\n<h2>Process</h2>\n<p>In terms of <i>process, </i>restorative justice restores agency, ownership, and decision-making power to those directly affected by the harmful event \u2013 victims, offenders, their families and supporters, and the wider community. Victimization is also commonly experienced as a form of disempowerment, a loss of control over one\u2019s life and security and a disconnection from those who have failed to provide protection or care. This feeling of disempowerment is often exacerbated by participation in the criminal trial process over which victims have no control and that renders them passive spectators on their own suffering. A similar disempowerment is experienced by defendants, whose case is presented on their behalf by paid advocates and who passively await the trial\u2019s outcome of verdict and sentencing. By contrast, rather than deferring all responsibility to the state or to legal professionals, restorative justice aims to restore instrumental power to the immediate participants in resolving the harm.</p>\n<h3>Outcomes</h3>\n<p>In terms of <i>outcomes</i>, by striving to repair the harms caused by the crime, restorative justice seeks to restore wellbeing to the individuals affected <i>and</i> to restore the relationship between them to a just condition. Both goals are crucial and inseparable. Individual wellbeing is promoted by trying to meet the needs of moral repair, such as having one\u2019s voice heard, one\u2019s experience validated, one\u2019s story verified, one\u2019s integrity or innocence vindicated, and one\u2019s intrinsic value affirmed.

Nor does it mean the advent of personal warmth or intimacy between them in the future: the two parties may agree never to see each other again. Rather it means that the nature of the relationship between them, as fellow citizens and fellow human beings, as well as co-participants in the harmful episode, is <i>restored to a rightful state</i>, that is, to one marked by equality of concern, dignity, freedom from deceit or coercion, and at least minimal social trust.</p>\n<h2>Emergence of a Movement</h2>\n<p>\u201cIt\u2019s no accident\u201d, Wolterstorff writes, \u201cthat all the great social justice movements of the twentieth century, struggling against one or another form of systemic injustice, employed the language of rights: women\u2019s rights, labor rights, civil rights, on and on\u201d. Another example is the victims\u2019 rights movement, which emerged in the 1970s, and which has contributed to the shaping of restorative justice agenda over the past 50 years.

    "bodyText": "Contemporary rights-talk is not enough. Something that does seem worth raising, though, is the question of what might be gained if this discussion of justice and rights was to be brought into conversation with recent debates about the political construction of rights-talk and the vital implications of this political construction for matters of justice. As Samuel Moyn and others have argued recently, insofar as human rights has been primarily defined in recent decades in terms of sufficientist understandings of basic rights and the need to protect people from atrocities and other violations of physical well-being, such rights-talk is \u201cnot enough.\u201d By sidelining questions of distributive justice, material equality, and reparations for past injustices, prevailing constructions of human rights offer only a partial vision of global justice. [\u00a03\u00a0]\n\nThinking with the parable of the good Samaritan. I think we can usefully \u201cthink with\u201d the parable of the good Samaritan to explore this idea. While Wolterstorff may be right to suggest that human rights should be defined more broadly, the fact is that they are often defined politically in narrow terms of the right of beaten men lying half dead by the side of the road to be (a) not beaten in the first place and (b) upon being beaten, to be cared for by good Samaritans.\n\nA broader vision of justice needs also to reckon with how individual people and also collectives such as sovereign states so often not only fail to behave as good Samaritans, but often behave as priests and Levites, crossing to the other side of the road to avoid encountering the vulnerable, or even in complicity with the robbers, acting in unjust ways, directly or systemically, past or present, that in one way or another amount to a degree of culpability for the vulnerability and suffering of others.\n\nJustice for refugees. I have tried to \u201cthink with\u201d the parable in this way in a recent book, co-written with my theologian brother, Mark Glanville, which considers how to think through questions of justice with respect to refugees. [\u00a04\u00a0] Writing for a Western Christian audience, we argue that we need to understand how wealthy Western states don\u2019t simply fail to act like the good Samaritan in failing to do more to care for refugees. Rather, they act like the priest and the Levite in the parable, going out of their way to keep refugees at a distance, detaining them, deterring them, and containing them in poorer developing regions of the world. And they also even act like the robbers, contributing historically and today to the vulnerability and suffering and displacement of so many people.\n\nFrom the wars and conquests, dispossession and eradication of indigenous peoples, the mass migration of people out of Europe, and the inflow of natural resources into Europe that attended European imperialism, to the reckless wars, exploitative economic regulations, and environmental destruction of the post-colonial era, Western states have accrued and continue to maintain territories and riches via practices that sustain the poverty, instability, and vulnerability of others, and contribute to the generation of situations that produce their displacement. Wealthy Western states thus owe obligations to displaced people as a matter of justice. Certainly, such a broader vision of justice can be articulated in terms of rights. But it is useful to recognize that prevailing discourses of rights actually often occlude such a broader vision.\n\nHow should states prioritize? One further potential limit to relying on rights-talk to provide a full vision of justice, and one that I\u2019m presently exploring in a different co-authored book project with political theorist James Pattison, is the question of how states should prioritize among multiple threats or acts of rights violations globally when thinking about where they should direct their attention and resources. [\u00a05\u00a0] Think of the competing needs to respond to global poverty, mass atrocities, global pandemics, and climate change, among many global threats and crises. Confronted with a plurality of competing demands, I think we need more than mere rights-talk to help us discern the requirements of justice. Questions about the allocation of responsibilities among multiple states and the prioritization of a single state\u2019s multiple responsibilities become much more central and indispensable.\n\nThe final part of Wolterstorff\u2019s brief turns to \u201cthe role of justice in and by and for the academy, and the importance of being alert to that role.\u201d I am entirely in agreement with his emphasis on the importance of being alert to the role of justice in scholarly research. However, I have serious reservations about his characterizations of the tasks of various academic disciplines. While for a range of reasons my own research interests have shifted in recent years such that they are very much in alignment with the kinds of concerns for justice that Wolterstorff recommends, I think an individual Christian scholar working in disciplines that he names on page 14 \u2013 \u201ceconomics, political theory, business and management, sociology and social work, health care, gender studies\u201d \u2013 can and often do usefully pursue a range of vital research questions that do not speak directly or explicitly to issues of justice, and we should not discourage this.\n\nJustice grounded in understanding. Wolterstorff criticizes scholars in these disciplines who, instead of focusing on what is just and unjust, focus on \u201cutilitarian considerations of power, efficiency, cost, preference, etc.\u201d But surely so much of our understanding of what is just and unjust relies on our understanding of these very things: e.g. (a) what are the possibilities and limits and hazards of power, (b) what options among many can be pursued with efficiency or inefficiency and with what cost, and (c) to what extent do the preferences of relevant actors shape the possibilities, limits, and hazards of certain courses of action?\n\nConsider, for example, the question of military intervention in response to atrocities. Before we confidently argue about the justice or injustice of intervention, we surely need careful research on the practice of intervention and whether and under what conditions it might be able to succeed in saving lives, and that will necessarily involve giving attention to considerations of such things as \u201cpower, efficiency, cost, preference, etc.\u201d [\u00a06\u00a0]\n\nSo much of what we take for granted about what is just and unjust relies on certain assumptions and prevailing understandings of such things, and a Christian scholar in these disciplines will often usefully take on the task of clarifying and improving such understandings. That Christian scholar may then choose to take on the additional task of addressing their findings directly and explicitly to questions of justice in a scholarly manner, but there will often be good reasons for them to leave it to others to do this \u2013 perhaps because they may not be trained or adept at such things or they lack the time or resources to do so.\n\nHistory should inform policy too. Relatedly, I would question the distinction that Wolterstorff draws between the disciplines that he first lists \u2013 \u201ceconomics, political theory, business and management, sociology and social work, health care, gender studies\u201d \u2013 and the discipline of history. Indeed, I think the basis of his argument here further reveals the justification for my previous reservation. Wolterstorff suggests that the field of history is different in that it does not make policy suggestions. I would respond that there are plenty of important research questions that Christian scholars can and do pursue in the earlier list of disciplines that also do not lead directly to policy suggestions. Often the task of offering a policy suggestion requires that scholars take an additional step of explicitly considering policy implications which, as I noted with respect to considerations of justice above, may not be best done by the same scholar who does the initial research. And at the same time, there is plenty of scope for historians to take the additional step of arguing for policy implications that follow from their historical research (or from the research of other historians), if they are capable of doing so. Indeed, historians often publicly lament that they have vital, policy-relevant things to say and that they try to say them publicly but that their opinions are ignored and that it is economists instead who today have the ears of policy-makers \u2013 to often-disastrous effect.

One is NWTB\u2019s approach of a \u201csystematic\u201d or constructive theologian who introduces a philosophical category (first and second orders, theory of justice, etc), then looks to its scriptural supports, logic and argument, offers a critical analysis and constructive synthesis, as well suggesting helpful applications to practical issues, including the scholarly life. The merits of this approach are: it is comprehensive in scope of the topic examined, persuasive in its method of enquiry, and winsome in finding biblical support for its thesis.\n\nAn alternative approach, that of a biblical theologian, is to start with the biblical text, and examine the particulars of time and place and situation of a biblical text, and then move up to more variegated biblical texts and their contexts, as a biblical theology is summarized and constructed at a more abstract level, finally applied to new contexts. My approach emphasizes \u201ccontext\u201d or \u201cculture,\u201d which are used interchangeably here. They refer to the tool I use in biblical studies in at least three areas:\n\nThe benefits of this approach are: attentiveness to contexts and nuances; and conscious effort to extrapolate from one context to another in order to make the biblical message more fitting to new situations. This contextual reading of the Bible may supplement, reinforce and extend NWTB\u2019s account of justice and rights in ways that can offer ways for disciplinary scholars across the entire range of GFI disciplines to fruitfully expand their awareness of justice and rights in their scholarship and scholarly lives.\n\nLet me illustrate this second approach through two examples of contextual readings of biblical texts cited by NWTB.\n\nFirstly , the meaning of the word \u201crighteousness\u201d in Habakkuk 2:4:\n\nThis is a complex text. The word \u201crighteous\u201d in the OT context is first and foremost not a moral category, but a theological one, which refers to a people who are set right before God in the Abrahamic covenant (Genesis 12, Romans 4, Galatians 3). This people are called \u201crighteous\u201d not because their own moral fortitude or sinlessness but because of God\u2019s faithfulness (\u201cmy faithfulness\u201d in the Greek OT, ca. 250 bce). The book of Habakkuk in its original context (Hebrew Bible, ca. 538 bce) is addressing the question stated in 1:1\u20134, \u201cWhy God\u2019s elect, called the righteous, are allowed to suffer in their captivity under the arrogant and unjust Babylon?\u201d Habbakuk 2:3\u20134 replied that, God is not pleased with the person who is not upright (i.e., the wicked Babylon), but the members of the covenant \u201cshall live by his faith [in God]\u201d\u2014the contrast in the original context is not \u201cfaith versus work,\u201d but \u201cfaith that leads to life\u201d versus \u201cwickedness or injustice that leads to death\u201d.\n\nWithout a contextual reading, one easily slips into a historical theology perspective, notably the Reformation debate regarding whether it is the believer\u2019s faith or his works that bring the salvation of God. The context of Martin Luther in 16 th century Europe is about whether the purchase of a letter of indulgence (works) will guarantee salvation or salvation comes simply by \u201cfaith alone.\u201d The Reformers are doing biblical interpretation that is cross-culturally biblical.\n\nA contextual reading of Habbakuk 2:3\u20134 shows that the righteous and just language is about being in the Abrahamic covenant of faith, and thereby covenant members are to live out the just requirements of the covenant (as explicitly spelled out in the Mosaic law) as the concrete expression of one\u2019s relationship with God. The people of God have broken the covenant when they defy justice, or worship false gods; therefore God has allowed the wicked Babylon to punish his own elect. Without the contextual reading, justice in its abstract quality may have the adverse effect of focusing on judicial justice and the following of commandments and injunctions. Habbakuk understands biblical justice has an intricate relationship between being God\u2019s people through faith and doing God\u2019s requirements as an obedience of that same faith.\n\nSecondly , the phrase \u201cthose who are hungry and thirst for righteousness [ dikaiosun e\u0304 ]\u201d in Matthew 5:6 has a different meaning than \u201cyou who are hungry\u201d in Luke 7:21, though both are parallel texts that describe the same teaching of Jesus, called \u201cbeatitudes,\u201d albeit in two different literary styles and nuances. Matthew\u2019s Gospel overall has certain features that focus on the inner life of being God\u2019s people, such as pursuing righteousness (the word appears seven times in Matthew, none in Mark, once in Luke, twice in John) as a quality of life in the Spirit of God (Matthew 5\u20137). In contrast, Luke\u2019s Gospel overall has certain features that focus on the social-political transformation of the gospel through the mission of God\u2019s people, such as \u201cpeace on earth and goodwill to all people\u201d (2:14), and to \u201cproclaim good news to the poor, release the captives, recover the sight of blind\u201d (4:18).\n\nIt is not strange at all for the community of Matthew who are predominantly Jewish to understand the word \u201crighteousness\u201d in the OT sense, that is, \u201crighteousness\u201d means one\u2019s relationship with God within the covenant (one\u2019s being) and one\u2019s faithful obedience as the duty expected from the members of that covenant (one\u2019s doing). In contrast to Matthew, Luke uses reversal as a literary style, so in Luke 6:21, 24\u201325, the blessing is pronounced on those who are hungry (because of an unjust social system) for they will be filled (by the reign/realm of God), the woe is pronounced on those who are full now (the oppressive rich) for they will be hungry.\n\nThis contextual reading of Matthew and Luke allows us to let both texts stand without the need to change Matthew\u2019s meaning (\u201cone hungers and thirsts for righteousness\u201d) into Luke\u2019s (\u201cone hungers and thirsts for justice \u201d). I see the contextual readings of Matthew and Luke speak to the beauty and power of diversity in the biblical revelation and its embrace of the creative tensions of differences within the Biblical canon, thus enabling biblical conceptions of justice to speak to myriad contexts.\n\nAfter a close reading of two biblical texts in their individual contexts, the next step for a biblical theologian is to offer what justice means as additional biblical texts are gathered together. The larger and variegated contexts of the biblical canon grant us a more robust understanding of justice than a few texts can.\n\nDo the biblical writers explain what justice is? Due to limited space, let me offer briefly my view of what justice ( mispat/krima ) and righteousness ( tzedek/dikaiousun e\u0304 ) mean in the OT:\n\nJustice ( mispat/krima ) is one of the attributes of God (Deuteronomy 32:4; Isaiah 28:6; 51:4\u20135; Jeremiah 9:24; Ezekiel 34:16) the Judge (Psalms 67:4; 96:13; 98:9), whose character is fairness (without prejudice) and (up)rightness in his dealing with people. \u201cHe is the Rock, his works are perfect, and all his ways are just. A faithful God who does no wrong, upright and just as he.\u201d (Deuteronomy 32:4) So the biblical language of justice is primarily theological (about who God is and what God does), covenantal (about the relationship God has with people), and legal (about laws or courts of law. An example of this language of justice is seen in the Book of Job, where Job charges God for breaking his covenantal relationship and therefore questions about his sovereignty over injustice in the cosmos.\n\n\u201c Righteousness ( tzedek/dikaiousun e\u0304 )\u201d [\u00a01\u00a0] in the OT is neither simply a legal concept nor the quality of religious observance, but about a relationship with God that requires a fulfillment of conditions of integrity, trustworthiness and uprightness that contribute to the peace and prosperity and flourishing of all (Job 29:16; 31:21; Proverbs 8:18; 14:23; 31:9). This idea of righteousness and its vocation extend from the OT\u2019s \u201cpeople of God\u201d to the NT\u2019s \u201ckingdom of God\u201d and the church.\n\nWhile the Bible may be understood in its cultural contexts, it does not mean the scope and responsibility of justice and righteousness are restricted to its first readers, for the God as described in the Bible is neither bound to contexts nor does God work only with one people (Israel or the church). God is the Judge-King of the universe and cares for the well-being of all his creation. The task of a biblical theologian is to apply the biblical theology of justice and righteousness to contexts beyond that of the Bible. Let me offer two suggestions regarding the \u201crules of engagement\u201d between faith (and Bible) and the academy (or disciplines) on the theme of justice:\n\nThe Bible affirms that the relationship God has with all people and the whole creation is established and maintained in equity or fairness (Isaiah 1:27 \u201cZion will be redeemed with justice\u201d) and what is right (2 Chronicles 12:6; Nehemiah 9:33). Justice is God\u2019s concern for the shalom of all, and the Bible has a universal scope of justice. God\u2019s peoples, who are called \u201cthe righteous\u201d or \u201cthe just,\u201d are expected to keep (in obedience to) the covenant as a way to maintain their identity of being God\u2019s people (Psalm 37:28; Proverb 28:5) for the sake of the goodness to the world. \u201cMy justice will become a light to the nations. My righteousness draws near speedily, my salvation is on the way, and my arm will bring justice to the nations\u201d (Isaiah 51:4\u20135). God uses his people, scholars among them, as an instrument to bring about justice in the world. Whoever else participates in the mission of a just God then aligns with the vision of God\u2019s reign on earth (Mark 9:40). The church does not have the monopoly of doing good and just. This point is significant to GFI because most of us work in a \u201csecular\u201d academic settings with colleagues who are gifted and may not (yet) profess their religious faith, or not (yet) articulate what is biblical justice. Still, God can work through the life of Mahatma Gandhi; God can even use the wicked Babylon. We need humility.\n\n\u201cRights\u201d and equity are measured and judged by the law or wisdom of God as contained in the Scripture. Yet biblical reading and biblical canon are never meant to limit what we can read, because the purpose of the Scripture is to be \u201ca lamp to our feet, a light to our paths,\u201d guiding and empowering us to be \u201csalt of the earth.\u201d In other words, the Bible warrants us to use it to read our world and cultural texts (such as laws of the land, sacred texts of civilizations, textbooks and research papers on physics, etc), using the Bible to shed light and transform our disciplines and our world today (Romans 12:1\u20132). One way to do this is to derive mega principles of the Bible on justice based on sound exegesis and robust biblical theology, and use the mega principles to engage constructively with our disciplinary research and scholarly life.\n\nBased on the two pointers above, let me highlight the twofold thesis (one of the mega principles) of the biblical theology of justice toward preserving and flavoring the world concerning justice and rights. The twofold thesis, like two sides of the same coin, is: 1) the being and doing of justice, and 2) justice based on love. The mega principle states, God\u2019s justice (his being just and his doing of justice) is relational to God\u2019s mercy or loving kindness ( hesed ), which is a fundamental aspect of who God is . Both concepts of justice and righteousness in the OT are based on God\u2019s loving kindness rather than simply on the law. God\u2019s loving kindness, including cruciform love (i.e., love taken as far as the Cross) as expressed in the NT, tempers forensic judgement from \u201ccold legal culture and rights-talk\u201d with a \u201cnew heart of the Spirit\u201d in a caring, empathizing, honoring culture. [\u00a02\u00a0]\n\nThe modern discourse about justice and rights often overemphasizes actions, behavior and duty, to the point of leaving aside the formation of a person and the community. Justice and right are not just legal injunctions or prohibitions (\u201cThou shalt not\u2026\u201d) and requirements (\u201cdo justly\u201d). When Jesus teaches \u201clove one another\u201d as \u201cthe new commandment\u201d (John 13:30), this new commandment has its continuity with Leviticus 19:18 (the old commandment) in the necessity of \u201cloving other\u201d but also goes beyond the duty and legal aspect of loving others. Jesus in effect is saying, to be just you must be a loving person \u2014be formed by God\u2019s love so much so that one just loves to love others. Without justice, love is not expressed, but without love, justice could be mere doing absent of relationship. Without love, justice may be restricted to litigation and cold culture; with love and mercy, justice looks toward mutually edifying community and flourishing culture. If love is the interpersonal relationship that forms justly who we are as human beings and the mutual indebtedness of love is the basis we do justice to all people, then Paul says it well in Romans 13:8 \u201c owe no one anything except to love one another.\u201d Love is the eternal \u201cdue/debt\u201d one has to others.\n\nIn order for me to have a conversation with other disciplines in GFI, I wish to push the boundary of justice beyond the \u201csocial systemic\u201d and take a cue from NWTB that \u201cjustice is the ground floor of shalom\u201d and shalom is about \u201cflourishing in all dimensions of one\u2019s existence\u201d (emphasis mine). There are three cultural frames about shalom (well-being) in biblical theology that will enable us to see justice (what is right and what is due) in a more fulsome language and elaborate vision, which can then be applied to the research interests of other disciplines (fields of study).\n\nThe first frame is that of a truthful and legal universe , and much of NWTB focuses articulately on this frame. Justice is about obeying the rules of life, abiding the laws of God, following the orders of the cosmos\u2014be they moral, political, economic, familial, etc. Injustice is missing the mark ( hamartia ), or doing wrong ( hata ). Mosaic laws have a lot to say about this, as do the Psalms, providing more or less direct biblical guidance to some disciplines:\n\nHow can the \u201clove your neighbors\u201d commandment of Leviticus 18 be practiced by , architects to design buildings that promote community life, to construct spatial justice etched with hospitality, especially to the vulnerable? In finance and banking, how can \u201clove your neighbors\u201d overcome poverty and challenge zero-sum games, e.g., offering lower interest loans (e.g., in micro-financing) or the zero-interest of cooperatives (e.g., Basque cooperatives, Israeli kibbutzim) in sharing of capital for, say, small business startups?\n\nIn the fields of law, criminology, politics and public policy, how can truth rather than prejudice address police violence and prison-sentencing which are so often racialized and class prejudiced? How can restorative justice better shape and transform the incarcerated beyond punitive justice? How can we create new policy, regulation and law that promote a human flourishing society?\n\nThe second frame is that of a moral universe that highlights the heavenly order of inherent goodness\u2014though some cultures view the order of this moral universe as oscillations or roles of yin and yang, cycles of good and evil. Justice in this frame is viewed as health due to do a person, animals, plants, outer space; and injustice is viewed as illness, toxic wastes, space trash, etc:\n\nHow can the fields of deep ecology and climate change and carbon cycle studies envision justice-oriented programs to restore the health of our habitat, ecology, outer space? Will they in turn generate justice for humanity?\n\nIn medicine and stem-cell research, how do we rectify the problem of ethnic and gender disparities in access to medical care or stem cell\u2010based therapies to those who need them? Are particular diseases still regarded as \u201ctaboos\u201d as some \u201cpatients\u201d continue to be \u201cstigmatized\u201d? In the fields of language studies, do we have a duty to overcome bigotry, bullying and toxic language?\n\nThe third frame is that of a holy and beautiful universe , one that is covered with its Creator\u2019s presence and glory. \u201cHonor everyone, love the brotherhood, fear God\u201d (1 Peter 2:17) is considered justice in this frame, because what is due to everyone is \u201chonor\u201d (shaming others is injustice); what is due to friends is \u201clove\u201d (hatred is injustice); and what is due to God is \u201cfear/reverence, glorifying\u201d. In contrast, injustice, as sin, has \u201cfallen short of the glory of God\u201d (Romans 3:23).\n\nHow can astronomy and physics attract scientists who are people of color or minorities, and by so doing advance the fields? In music, mathematic and photography, is the \u201cgolden ratio/mean\u201d universal or culturally defined in terms of what is aesthetically pleasing or morally just?\n\nIs it a matter of injustice in the world when the elitism of academics makes their works inaccessible to the wider world, or unintelligible to sister disciplines? Does \u201civory-tower\u201d research produce the best scholarship, even when not immediately practical in its applications? How do scholars within GFI envision and promote bridge-building among ourselves as ways to honor the gifts and talents has given us in ways that reflect God\u2019s glory holistically?\n\n. . .\n\nFinally, the relational nature of justice is the hard thesis of this paper, and it raises a fundamental question for academics: How can interdisciplinary and cross-disciplinary knowledges be viewed as essential for one\u2019s discipline? And as busy researchers, how do we care for our loved ones, our research assistants, our colleagues, beyond productivity (just as we will look into the eyes of a beggar affirming his humanity when we hand him the money)?\n\nLet us have tea or coffee\u2014Let us break bread together !\n\nReventlow, Henning Graf, and Yair Hoffman.

One is NWTB\u2019s approach of a \u201csystematic\u201d or constructive theologian who introduces a philosophical category (first and second orders, theory of justice, etc), then looks to its scriptural supports, logic and argument, offers a critical analysis and constructive synthesis, as well suggesting helpful applications to practical issues, including the scholarly life.

Yet biblical reading and biblical canon are never meant to limit what we can read, because the purpose of the Scripture is to be \u201ca lamp to our feet, a light to our paths,\u201d guiding and empowering us to be \u201csalt of the earth.\u201d In other words, the Bible warrants us to use it to read our world and cultural texts (such as laws of the land, sacred texts of civilizations, textbooks and research papers on physics, etc), using the Bible to shed light and transform our disciplines and our world today (Romans 12:1\u20132). One way to do this is to derive mega principles of the Bible on justice based on sound exegesis and robust biblical theology, and use the mega principles to engage constructively with our disciplinary research and scholarly life.</p>\n<p>Based on the two pointers above, let me highlight the twofold thesis (one of the mega principles) of the biblical theology of justice toward preserving and flavoring the world concerning justice and rights. The twofold thesis, like two sides of the same coin, is: 1) the being and doing of justice, and 2) justice based on love. The mega principle states, God\u2019s justice (his being just and his doing of justice) is relational to God\u2019s mercy or loving kindness (<i>hesed</i>), which is a fundamental aspect <i>of who God is</i>. Both concepts of justice and righteousness in the OT are based on God\u2019s loving kindness rather than simply on the law. God\u2019s loving kindness, including cruciform love (i.e., love taken as far as the Cross) as expressed in the NT, tempers forensic judgement from \u201ccold legal culture and rights-talk\u201d with a \u201cnew heart of the Spirit\u201d in a caring, empathizing, honoring culture.<a class=\"anchor\" id=\"content100note2anc\" name=\"content100note2anc\">\u00a0</a><a class=\"note\" href=\"#content100note2sym\">[\u00a02\u00a0]</a></p>\n<p>The modern discourse about justice and rights often overemphasizes actions, behavior and duty, to the point of leaving aside the formation of a person and the community. Justice and right are <i>not just</i> legal injunctions or prohibitions (\u201cThou shalt not\u2026\u201d) and requirements (\u201cdo justly\u201d). When Jesus teaches \u201clove one another\u201d as \u201cthe new commandment\u201d (John 13:30), this <i>new commandment</i> has its continuity with Leviticus 19:18 (the old commandment) in the necessity of \u201cloving other\u201d but also goes beyond the duty and legal aspect of loving others. Jesus in effect is saying, <i>to be just you must be</i> <i>a loving person</i>\u2014be formed by God\u2019s love so much so that one just loves to love others. Without justice, love is not expressed, but without love, justice could be mere doing absent of relationship. Without love, justice may be restricted to litigation and cold culture; with love and mercy, justice looks toward mutually edifying community and flourishing culture. If love is the interpersonal relationship that forms <i>justly</i> who we are as human beings and the mutual indebtedness of love is the basis we do justice to all people, then Paul says it well in Romans 13:8 \u201c<i>owe</i> no one anything except to <i>love</i> one another.\u201d Love is the eternal \u201cdue/debt\u201d one has to others.</p>\n<h2>Three Frames for Conversing with Other Disciplines</h2>\n<p>In order for me to have a conversation with other disciplines in GFI, I wish to push the boundary of justice beyond the \u201csocial systemic\u201d and take a cue from NWTB that \u201cjustice is the ground floor of shalom\u201d and shalom is about \u201cflourishing in<i> all dimensions</i> of one\u2019s existence\u201d (emphasis mine). There are three cultural frames about shalom (well-being) in biblical theology that will enable us to see justice (what is right and what is due) in a more fulsome language and elaborate vision, which can then be applied to the research interests of other disciplines (fields of study).</p>\n<p>The first frame is that of a <i>truthful and legal universe</i>, and much of NWTB focuses articulately on this frame. Justice is about obeying the rules of life, abiding the laws of God, following the orders of the cosmos\u2014be they moral, political, economic, familial, etc. Injustice is missing the mark (<i>hamartia</i>), or doing wrong (<i>hata</i>). Mosaic laws have a lot to say about this, as do the Psalms, providing more or less direct biblical guidance to some disciplines:</p>\n<p>How can the \u201clove your neighbors\u201d commandment of Leviticus 18 be practiced by , architects to design buildings that promote community life, to construct spatial justice etched with hospitality, especially to the vulnerable? In finance and banking, how can \u201clove your neighbors\u201d overcome poverty and challenge zero-sum games, e.g., offering lower interest loans (e.g., in micro-financing) or the zero-interest of cooperatives (e.g., Basque cooperatives, Israeli kibbutzim) in sharing of capital for, say, small business startups?</p>\n<p>In the fields of law, criminology, politics and public policy, how can truth rather than prejudice address police violence and prison-sentencing which are so often racialized and class prejudiced? How can restorative justice better shape and transform the incarcerated beyond punitive justice? How can we create new policy, regulation and law that promote a human flourishing society?</p>\n<p>The second frame is that of a <i>moral universe</i> that highlights the heavenly order of inherent goodness\u2014though some cultures view the order of this moral universe as oscillations or roles of yin and yang, cycles of good and evil. Justice in this frame is viewed as health due to do a person, animals, plants, outer space; and injustice is viewed as illness, toxic wastes, space trash, etc:</p>\n<p>How can the fields of deep ecology and climate change and carbon cycle studies envision justice-oriented programs to restore the health of our habitat, ecology, outer space? Will they in turn generate justice for humanity?</p>\n<p>In medicine and stem-cell research, how do we rectify the problem of ethnic and gender disparities in access to medical care or stem cell\u2010based therapies to those who need them? Are particular diseases still regarded as \u201ctaboos\u201d as some \u201cpatients\u201d continue to be \u201cstigmatized\u201d? In the fields of language studies, do we have a duty to overcome bigotry, bullying and toxic language?</p>\n<p>The third frame is that of <i>a holy and beautiful universe</i>, one that is covered with its Creator\u2019s presence and glory. \u201cHonor everyone, love the brotherhood, fear God\u201d (1 Peter 2:17) is considered justice in this frame, because what is due to everyone is \u201chonor\u201d (shaming others is injustice); what is due to friends is \u201clove\u201d (hatred is injustice); and what is due to God is \u201cfear/reverence, glorifying\u201d. In contrast, injustice, as sin, has \u201cfallen short of the glory of God\u201d (Romans 3:23).</p>\n<p>How can astronomy and physics attract scientists who are people of color or minorities, and by so doing <i>advance</i> the fields? In music, mathematic and photography, is the \u201cgolden ratio/mean\u201d universal or culturally defined in terms of what is aesthetically pleasing or morally just?</p>\n<p>Is it a matter of injustice in the world when the elitism of academics makes their works inaccessible to the wider world, or unintelligible to sister disciplines? Does \u201civory-tower\u201d research produce the best scholarship, even when not immediately practical in its applications? How do scholars within GFI envision and promote bridge-building among ourselves as ways to honor the gifts and talents has given us in ways that reflect God\u2019s glory holistically?</p>\n<p>. . .</p>\n<p>Finally, the relational nature of justice is the hard thesis of this paper, and it raises a fundamental question for academics: How can interdisciplinary and cross-disciplinary knowledges be viewed as essential for one\u2019s discipline? And as busy researchers, how do we care for our loved ones, our research assistants, our colleagues, beyond productivity (just as we will look into the eyes of a beggar affirming his humanity when we hand him the money)?</p>\n<p>Let us have tea or coffee\u2014Let us break bread <i>together</i>!</p>\n<h2 class=\"new_page\">Further Readings</h2>\n<p>Reventlow, Henning Graf, and Yair Hoffman. <i>Justice and Righteousness: Biblical Themes and Their Influence. </i>Sheffield: Sheffield Academic Press, 1992.

    "bodyText": "Here in Colombia, the decades-long armed conflict between guerrilla militia, paramilitary groups, the national army, and drug cartels has resulted in literally millions of documented human rights violations. In response to that grave reality, the Colombian government has made human rights a major part of the educational curriculum and public discourse for the past generation. Rights language is pervasive, and generally in what Prof. Wolterstorff dubbed a \"second-order\" fashion (i.e., the focus is on providing restitution to the victims of the conflict). There is a lot to celebrate in that, to be sure. But some downsides (or, in Prof. Wolterstorff\u2019s language, \u201cabuses\u201d) have attended the prominence given to rights discourse.\n\nNeedless to say, the confluence of these three downsides/abuses of rights discourse creates vicious social dynamics.\n\nBecause of this context in which I work, I was struck by the way that Prof. Wolterstorff\u2019s Preview stated that \u201crights are grounded in the worth (excellence, dignity) of the rights-bearer.\u201d Here in Colombia, people would ground rights in our inherent dignity (under the influence of Catholic social teaching), but not in our excellence . A great deal could be gained, in the Colombian context, by balancing attention to the rights you have because of your inherent dignity with an emphasis on the fact that being a person with profound dignity means that you are, by your nature, a person of excellencies, excellencies with ramifications for the way in which you are also an agent of justice (first and second order) for others. This is not by any stretch to deny the necessity of protecting against human rights violations nor to undercut the role of the state in contributing to that task. It is rather to try to activate individuals and communities as being agents of justice, rather than simply being claimants for justice.\n\nThe first key move made by Prof. Wolterstorff was to counter the mentality of possessive individualism with an affirmation that collective entities have rights as well ; rights, he pointed out, are not solely the domain of the individual person. In tandem with that observation, he made a second move, flipping the script of much rights discourse and arguing that all genuine rights imply duties and obligations as their corollaries : if a person or a collective has rights, then anyone in relationship to that person or collective has obligations to treat them in accordance with their rights.\n\nIf Wolterstorff is correct in claiming that rights entail obligations, and that collectives as well as individuals have rights, it follows that collectives as well as individuals have obligations. I would argue further that, if a collective has an obligation, the individuals within that collective share that obligation, at least partially (although the full weight of that obligation does not lay upon any one member of the collective). Even if a collective concentrates power in the hands of its leadership, should the leadership fail to follow through on its duties, the members of the collective still bear those obligations, in accordance with the others\u2019 rights.\n\nThis set of maneuvers holds promise for overcoming the individualist passivity that I have identified behind the indolence of much of Colombian civil society vis-\u00e0-vis the displacement crisis. Colombia as a nation has already agreed that forced displacement is a violation of the rights of their citizens, insofar as it entails (both directly and indirectly) a transgression of the rights to a dignified life, to safety, to liberty, and to private property. [\u00a01\u00a0] Furthermore, since the Colombian government has failed in meeting its constitutional obligations to ensure the rights of its IDP citizens, the Supreme Court of Colombia has declared the displacement crisis to be an unconstitutional state of affairs. Nonetheless, the Colombian government has expressed openly that it does not have the financial or logistical resources required to rectify these human rights violations for the entire displaced population. [\u00a02\u00a0] In other words: the leadership of the collective has admitted that it is incapable of fulfilling its obligations to IDP citizens.\n\nThe standard Colombian reaction to this state of affairs is to decry the ineptitude or corruption of the government, or to lament the tragedy of the situation, without taking personal initiative to rectify the injustices suffered by victims of the conflict. This reaction is more apparent the closer a population is to the center of governmental power in Colombia. In the Faith and Displacement project, when working with churches in Bogot\u00e1 (the capital of Colombia, where the potency of the government is most apparent and where a disproportionate amount of federal money is spent), I tend to encounter a high degree of resistance to the idea that members of the church should take personal action on behalf of IDPs; people are eager to participate in our training under the assumption that it is primarily theoretical and about raising awareness, but balk when it comes to engaging personally with the displaced. By contrast, church teams hailing from smaller municipalities readily embrace training for work directly with displaced populations, because they are under few illusions that the government will sweep in and make good on its obligations to IDPs. It is in response to dynamics like these that Prof. Wolterstorff\u2019s Brief could prove especially productive in moving conversation forward in Colombia.\n\nIf I am right in surmising that the members of collectives share in the obligations of their collective, then the failure of the Colombian government to respond to the violated rights of the citizens of Colombia becomes a failing of the citizens whose rights were not violated. It is therefore incumbent upon those citizens to act positively and constructively at least to ameliorate if not completely rectify violations of the rights of the displaced. Prof. Wolterstorff made a similar point by evoking John Lewis and Martin Luther King Jr., who urged, \u201cwhen you see something that is not right, you must say something. You must do something.\u201d In other words, when the collective leadership of civil society perpetrates or permits the violation of human rights, the constituent members of the society are bound by duty to take action themselves. So, insofar as Colombian people recognize that the displacement crisis amounts to a series of both punctiliar and persistent violations of human rights\u2014violations not being adequately addressed by their collective leadership\u2014they are duty-bound to act at least in some degree to rectify that injustice.\n\nI will admit, however, to having live questions about how to analyze the degree to which one is obliged to act on behalf of those whose rights are violated when one\u2019s collective fails to live up to its obligations. Perhaps an argument could be made that the extent of one\u2019s obligation correlates directly with the extent of one\u2019s power (i.e. a university president has greater responsibility than an impoverished shopkeeper) and the degree of gravity of the rights violated (i.e. action is more urgent in the face of genocide than in response to price manipulation), and inversely with the size of the collective of which one forms a part (i.e., one has relatively less obligation to address a problem on a national scale than one does to address a problem in one\u2019s own neighborhood). But I would be grateful for a philosopher to shed more light on this topic.\n\nProf. Wolterstorff extended King and Lewis\u2019s exhortation \u201cYou must do something\u201d from civil society to the Academy. As a seminary professor, however, my bailiwick is comprised to more or less equal extents by the Academy and the Church. So, in what follows, I would like to explore further how to apply the \u201cagent\u201d and \u201cclaimant/patient\u201d dimensions of justice in specific relation to the work the Faith and Displacement project does in mobilizing local churches to respond to the displacement crisis in Colombia. But, when shifting the focus from society and Academy to the Church, I need to pick up something Prof. Wolterstorff says about love.\n\nProf. Wolterstorff\u2019s Brief begins by discussing, not rights, but the relationship of justice and love. Responding to a position that construes (New Testament, Christian) love in a supersessionist relationship to (Old Testament) justice [\u00a03\u00a0] \u2014claiming speciously that the gratuitous charity extolled by Jesus replaces the Law\u2019s attention to proportionality and punishment\u2014Wolterstorff argues that justice is a constituent component of love. Justice is not coextensive with love, but certainly inseparable from it, such that one could not claim to be exercising love while violating justice. In his words,\n\nLove and justice must be understood in such a way that love incorporates justice.\u2026 Love should be understood not as gratuitous benevolence that pays no attention to what justice requires but as care \u2014 not care for but care about . When I care about you, I seek to promote your good, including the good of your being treated by myself and others as justice requires. Agapic love, understood as care, incorporates acting justly. Its comprehensive goal is shalom.\n\nIn relation to my ecclesially-based work with displaced people, two aspects of this argument are especially worth drawing out. First, by emphasizing \u201ccare about\u201d others, rather than \u201ccare for\u201d others, Wolterstorff hedges against the sort of paternalistic benevolence that so often accompanies Christian work with vulnerable populations. [\u00a04\u00a0] Such objectifying and condescending care fails to recognize and cultivate the person\u2019s intrinsic excellences, thus potentially revictimizing the person through one\u2019s own good intentions. [\u00a05\u00a0]\n\nSecond, by incorporating justice (to which people have a right) within love, Wolterstorff implies that people actually have a right to at very least an aspect of love. I am curious to know if Prof. Wolterstorff would believe that people have a right to be loved tout court . But even without his imprimatur , I am attracted to the notion that, within the scope of Christian theology and ethics, all people have the right to our love (especially given that the command to love one\u2019s neighbor as oneself is widely agreed to be a duty incumbent upon all Christians). Nonetheless, even if one were reticent to claim that all people have the right to be loved in the most capacious sense of the word, the more modest notion that people have the right to justice qua a subset of love could have major ramifications for Christian ministry to vulnerable populations.\n\nWithin evangelical Christianities in the Americas (Colombia being no exception), Christian social action is typically construed as an expression of love, quite reasonably. However, under a Reformation pressure to hedge against any account of moral obligation that could be construed as \u201csalvation by works,\u201d the expression of love in social action tends to be understood as supererogatory piety , i.e., morally praiseworthy action that is not strictly speaking required by the religion. Given that the love expressed in Christian social action is viewed as supererogatory, people surmise that action on behalf of the marginalized and victimized is basically optional. We do not tend to see the downtrodden of society as having a binding claim on our love; the only people who we might concede have the right to our love are the members of our nuclear family. All other loves are thought supererogatory, optional, such that the abused of society do not have a right, strictly speaking, to our love.\n\nProf. Wolterstorff\u2019s argument, however, does seem to indicate that people have a right to our love, at very least insofar as justice is a part of love and a person has a right to justice. As such, if a person with whom I am in relationship has suffered the violation of their first-order rights to justice, I have a moral obligation to love them by pursuing second-order justice for that person. That sort of love of neighbor is not a matter of supererogatory piety; it is an obligation incumbent upon me, an obligation with a \u201cperemptory\u201d force. This sort of construal of love in relation to justice and rights creates a much stronger argument about the moral obligations of Christians towards survivors of injustices.\n\nThis line of reasoning is immensely applicable to the work of Faith and Displacement in mobilizing churches to foster the recuperation of the IDPs, especially because our foundational motivating arguments to the churches advance in close synchrony with the opening reflections on justice and love in Wolterstorff\u2019s Brief. When training churches as part of the Faith and Displacement project, I begin by introducing the concept of shalom \u2014holistically construed in terms of spiritual, material, emotional, and relational flourishing. I then move to Luke 4:16-21, to identify how Jesus (citing Isaiah 61:1-2) construed his own ministry in multidimensional fashion, entailing justice, economic well-being, political freedom, and emotional health. [\u00a06\u00a0] These opening forays reveal a good deal of theological alignment with Prof. Wolterstorff\u2019s Brief.\n\nMy next move in training churches, however, it to explore the Sheep and Goats Judgement of Matthew 25:31-46. This text commends itself to the topic of serving displaced persons because it speaks not only of the impecunious, but specifically includes the xenoi , foreigners or migrants. The basic argument this passage is twofold:\n\nI want to zero in on that second point. The King\u2019s argument in Matthew 25 is not that one is condemned for having deprived the hungry of bread, for having withheld water from the thirsty, for having stripped the naked, or infecting the sick or arresting the prisoner or expelling the migrant. Rather, the goats are condemned for having simply seen the hungry, naked, and migrant, and having done nothing. [\u00a07\u00a0]\n\nThe logic of this text, claiming that one can be punished for not acting on behalf of the \u201cleast of these,\u201d implies that one has an obligation to the vulnerable. Acting on their behalf is not merely an expression of supererogatory charity; it is a morally binding duty, the neglect of which merits punishment. This text is thus neatly compatible with Prof. Wolterstorff\u2019s account of justice as a right that is a part of love. [\u00a08\u00a0] Interpreting Matthew 25 for the 21 st century, it would not distort the text to construe \u201cthe least of these\u201d as people with a right to food, water, and clothing (matters of justice) as well as to being visited in prison and welcomed as strangers (matters of love more broadly). We who see the least of these, whether as members of the body of Christ or of Colombian society, have moral duties to act justly and lovingly towards them, both in terms of our daily first-order dealings with them, and in terms of pursuing second-order justice for them when the State has failed to provide it.\n\nProf. Wolterstorff\u2019s brief provides a nuanced account of rights\u2014replete with distinctions between first and second orders, agents and claimants/patients, rights and duties, collectives and individuals\u2014that is poignant for this theologian, working to mobilize churches in response to the Colombian displacement crisis. To explore how this might be the case, I have taken the liberty drawing out some points that seemed implicit in Wolterstorff\u2019s argumentation, specifically venturing that members of collectives share the moral obligations of their collective (e.g., citizens share some of the moral responsibilities of their governments) and also suggesting that (within Wolterstorff\u2019s construal of justice as a part of love) people\u2019s right to justice also implies a right to love. These insights strengthen the case that Colombian citizens, especially Colombian believers, are morally obligated to act on behalf of Colombian IDPs, and in such a fashion as comports with the intrinsic excellencies of those displaced persons. And although Colombia, like any other nation, has distinctive cultural and political features, I would wager that the reflections above are pertinent to any number of nations in which rights discourse is prominent and in which the Church finds itself sliding into passivity in the face of injustice. Such contexts are, lamentably, not few.\n\nIn closing, allow me to venture an exhortation for seminaries. Most institutions of theological education have a strong sense that, by training church leaders, they are serving the good of society, like leaven in dough. This strikes me as true. But our efficacy is often blunted by our tendency to silo ourselves off from other academic disciplines. Faith and Displacement is one seminary\u2019s attempt to learn deeply from diverse social-scientific disciplines, at the levels of theory, practice, and empirical verification. The Faculty Initiative has the potential to facilitate much the same thing, albeit in relation to a much wider range of disciplines and topics. The Faculty Initiative invites the seminary professor to contribute her or his theological knowledge to believers in other academic disciplines, as well as to receive help from those believing scholars with diverse specialties, in order to be more effective in serving the mission of the Church in the world. It is an invitation to see interdisciplinary study, not as a niche endeavor for fringe theologians, but as an opportunity to speak more truly about God, if we believe that all truth is God\u2019s truth.

    "bodyHtml": "<p>Here in Colombia, the decades-long armed conflict between guerrilla militia, paramilitary groups, the national army, and drug cartels has resulted in literally millions of documented human rights violations. In response to that grave reality, the Colombian government has made human rights a major part of the educational curriculum and public discourse for the past generation. Rights language is pervasive, and generally in what Prof. Wolterstorff dubbed a \"second-order\" fashion (i.e., the focus is on providing restitution to the victims of the conflict). There is a lot to celebrate in that, to be sure. But some downsides (or, in Prof. Wolterstorff\u2019s language, \u201cabuses\u201d) have attended the prominence given to rights discourse.</p>\n<p>Needless to say, the confluence of these three downsides/abuses of rights discourse creates vicious social dynamics.</p>\n<p>Because of this context in which I work, I was struck by the way that Prof. Wolterstorff\u2019s Preview stated that \u201crights are grounded in the worth (excellence, dignity) of the rights-bearer.\u201d Here in Colombia, people would ground rights in our inherent dignity (under the influence of Catholic social teaching), but not in our <em>excellence</em>. A great deal could be gained, in the Colombian context, by balancing attention to the rights you have because of your inherent dignity with an emphasis on the fact that being a person with profound dignity means that you are, by your nature, a person of excellencies, excellencies with ramifications for the way in which you are also an agent of justice (first and second order) for others. This is not by any stretch to deny the necessity of protecting against human rights violations nor to undercut the role of the state in contributing to that task. It is rather to try to activate individuals and communities as being <em>agents</em> of justice, rather than simply being <em>claimants</em> for justice.</p>\n<h2>The Rights and Obligations of Collective Entities, and Their Members</h2>\n<p>In his more fulsome Theology Brief, Prof. Wolterstorff dug deeper into \u201cWhy the recognition of rights is important\u201d, responding to the wariness that some expressed about how rights language sometimes reinforces people\u2019s sense of entitlement, due to a \u201cmentality of possessive individualism.\u201d He picked up the distinction made above between being <em>agents </em>of justice and <em>claimants </em>for justice. Building on that distinction, he made two further clarifications that I believe would be salutary for correcting the passivity evident in many Colombians as a result of a distorted understanding of human rights.<sup> </sup>(To be clear: in this Brief, Colombians come under criticism, simply because this is the context in which I currently live and work. Nonetheless, I would venture that analogous arguments could be made in any number of national or cultural contexts where rights discourses\u2014and abuses\u2014have become prominent.)</p>\n<h3>Extending the Argument about Rights and Obligations</h3>\n<p>The first key move made by Prof. Wolterstorff was to counter the mentality of possessive individualism with an affirmation that <em>collective entities have rights as well</em>; rights, he pointed out, are not solely the domain of the individual person. In tandem with that observation, he made a second move, flipping the script of much rights discourse and arguing that <em>all genuine rights imply duties and obligations as their corollaries</em>: if a person or a collective has rights, then anyone in relationship to that person or collective has obligations to treat them in accordance with their rights.</p>\n<p>If Wolterstorff is correct in claiming that rights entail obligations, and that collectives as well as individuals have rights, it follows that collectives as well as individuals have obligations. I would argue further that, if a collective has an obligation, the individuals within that collective share that obligation, at least partially (although the full weight of that obligation does not lay upon any one member of the collective). Even if a collective concentrates power in the hands of its leadership, should the leadership fail to follow through on its duties, the members of the collective still bear those obligations, in accordance with the others\u2019 rights.</p>\n<h3>Relevance for the Colombian Displacement Crisis</h3>\n<p>This set of maneuvers holds promise for overcoming the individualist passivity that I have identified behind the indolence of much of Colombian civil society <em>vis-\u00e0-vis</em> the displacement crisis. Colombia as a nation has already agreed that forced displacement is a violation of the rights of their citizens, insofar as it entails (both directly and indirectly) a transgression of the rights to a dignified life, to safety, to liberty, and to private property.<a class=\"anchor\" id=\"content100note1anc\" name=\"content100note1anc\">\u00a0</a><a class=\"note\" href=\"#content100note1sym\">[\u00a01\u00a0]</a> Furthermore, since the Colombian government has failed in meeting its constitutional obligations to ensure the rights of its IDP citizens, the Supreme Court of Colombia has declared the displacement crisis to be an unconstitutional state of affairs. Nonetheless, the Colombian government has expressed openly that it does not have the financial or logistical resources required to rectify these human rights violations for the entire displaced population.<a class=\"anchor\" id=\"content100note2anc\" name=\"content100note2anc\">\u00a0</a><a class=\"note\" href=\"#content100note2sym\">[\u00a02\u00a0]</a> In other words: the leadership of the collective has admitted that it is incapable of fulfilling its obligations to IDP citizens.</p>\n<p>The standard Colombian reaction to this state of affairs is to decry the ineptitude or corruption of the government, or to lament the tragedy of the situation, without taking personal initiative to rectify the injustices suffered by victims of the conflict. This reaction is more apparent the closer a population is to the center of governmental power in Colombia. In the <em>Faith and Displacement </em>project, when working with churches in Bogot\u00e1 (the capital of Colombia, where the potency of the government is most apparent and where a disproportionate amount of federal money is spent), I tend to encounter a high degree of resistance to the idea that members of the church should take personal action on behalf of IDPs; people are eager to participate in our training under the assumption that it is primarily theoretical and about raising awareness, but balk when it comes to engaging personally with the displaced. By contrast, church teams hailing from smaller municipalities readily embrace training for work directly with displaced populations, because they are under few illusions that the government will sweep in and make good on its obligations to IDPs. It is in response to dynamics like these that Prof. Wolterstorff\u2019s Brief could prove especially productive in moving conversation forward in Colombia.</p>\n<p>If I am right in surmising that the members of collectives share in the obligations of their collective, then the failure of the Colombian government to respond to the violated rights of the citizens of Colombia becomes a failing of the citizens whose rights were <em>not</em> violated. It is therefore incumbent upon those citizens to act positively and constructively at least to ameliorate if not completely rectify violations of the rights of the displaced. Prof. Wolterstorff made a similar point by evoking John Lewis and Martin Luther King Jr., who urged, \u201cwhen you see something that is not right, you must say something. You must do something.\u201d In other words, when the collective leadership of civil society perpetrates or permits the violation of human rights, the constituent members of the society are bound by duty to take action themselves. So, insofar as Colombian people recognize that the displacement crisis amounts to a series of both punctiliar and persistent violations of human rights\u2014violations not being adequately addressed by their collective leadership\u2014they are duty-bound to act at least in some degree to rectify that injustice.</p>\n<p>I will admit, however, to having live questions about how to analyze the degree to which one is obliged to act on behalf of those whose rights are violated when one\u2019s collective fails to live up to its obligations. Perhaps an argument could be made that the extent of one\u2019s obligation correlates <em>directly</em> with the extent of one\u2019s power (i.e. a university president has greater responsibility than an impoverished shopkeeper) and the degree of gravity of the rights violated (i.e. action is more urgent in the face of genocide than in response to price manipulation), and <em>inversely</em> with the size of the collective of which one forms a part (i.e., one has relatively less obligation to address a problem on a national scale than one does to address a problem in one\u2019s own neighborhood). But I would be grateful for a philosopher to shed more light on this topic.</p>\n<h2>Justice and Love, and the Right(s) Thereto</h2>\n<p>Prof. Wolterstorff extended King and Lewis\u2019s exhortation \u201cYou must do something\u201d from civil society to the Academy. As a seminary professor, however, my bailiwick is comprised to more or less equal extents by the Academy and the Church. So, in what follows, I would like to explore further how to apply the \u201cagent\u201d and \u201cclaimant/patient\u201d dimensions of justice in specific relation to the work the <em>Faith and Displacement </em>project does in mobilizing local churches to respond to the displacement crisis in Colombia. But, when shifting the focus from society and Academy to the Church, I need to pick up something Prof. Wolterstorff says about love.</p>\n<h3>Justice as a Part of Love</h3>\n<p>Prof. Wolterstorff\u2019s Brief begins by discussing, not rights, but the relationship of justice and love. Responding to a position that construes (New Testament, Christian) love in a supersessionist relationship to (Old Testament) justice<a class=\"anchor\" id=\"content100note3anc\" name=\"content100note3anc\">\u00a0</a><a class=\"note\" href=\"#content100note3sym\">[\u00a03\u00a0]</a> \u2014claiming speciously that the gratuitous charity extolled by Jesus replaces the Law\u2019s attention to proportionality and punishment\u2014Wolterstorff argues that justice is a constituent component of love. Justice is not coextensive with love, but certainly inseparable from it, such that one could not claim to be exercising love while violating justice. In his words,</p>\n<blockquote><p>Love and justice must be understood in such a way that love incorporates justice.\u2026 Love should be understood not as gratuitous benevolence that pays no attention to what justice requires but as <em>care </em>\u2014 not care <em>for</em> but care <em>about</em>. When I care about you, I seek to promote your good, including the good of your being treated by myself and others as justice requires. Agapic love, understood as care, incorporates acting justly. Its comprehensive goal is shalom.</p></blockquote>\n<p>Love and justice must be understood in such a way that love incorporates justice.\u2026 Love should be understood not as gratuitous benevolence that pays no attention to what justice requires but as <em>care </em>\u2014 not care <em>for</em> but care <em>about</em>. When I care about you, I seek to promote your good, including the good of your being treated by myself and others as justice requires. Agapic love, understood as care, incorporates acting justly. Its comprehensive goal is shalom.</p>\n<p>In relation to my ecclesially-based work with displaced people, two aspects of this argument are especially worth drawing out. First, by emphasizing \u201ccare about\u201d others, rather than \u201ccare for\u201d others, Wolterstorff hedges against the sort of paternalistic benevolence that so often accompanies Christian work with vulnerable populations.<a class=\"anchor\" id=\"content100note4anc\" name=\"content100note4anc\">\u00a0</a><a class=\"note\" href=\"#content100note4sym\">[\u00a04\u00a0]</a> Such objectifying and condescending care fails to recognize and cultivate the person\u2019s intrinsic excellences, thus potentially revictimizing the person through one\u2019s own good intentions.<a class=\"anchor\" id=\"content100note5anc\" name=\"content100note5anc\">\u00a0</a><a class=\"note\" href=\"#content100note5sym\">[\u00a05\u00a0]</a></p>\n<p>Second, by incorporating justice (to which people have a right) within love, Wolterstorff implies that people actually have a right to at very least <em>an aspect </em>of love. I am curious to know if Prof. Wolterstorff would believe that people have a right to be loved <em>tout court</em>. But even without his <em>imprimatur</em>, I am attracted to the notion that, within the scope of Christian theology and ethics, all people have the <em>right </em>to our love (especially given that the command to love one\u2019s neighbor as oneself is widely agreed to be a duty incumbent upon all Christians). Nonetheless, even if one were reticent to claim that all people have the right to be loved in the most capacious sense of the word, the more modest notion that people have the right to justice <em>qua </em>a subset of love could have major ramifications for Christian ministry to vulnerable populations.</p>\n<h3>Love is Not Optional</h3>\n<p>Within evangelical Christianities in the Americas (Colombia being no exception), Christian social action is typically construed as an expression of love, quite reasonably. However, under a Reformation pressure to hedge against any account of moral obligation that could be construed as \u201csalvation by works,\u201d the expression of love in social action tends to be understood as <em>supererogatory piety</em>, i.e., morally praiseworthy action that is not strictly speaking required by the religion. Given that the love expressed in Christian social action is viewed as supererogatory, people surmise that action on behalf of the marginalized and victimized is basically optional. We do not tend to see the downtrodden of society as having a binding claim on our love; the only people who we might concede have the <em>right </em>to our love are the members of our nuclear family. All other loves are thought supererogatory, optional, such that the abused of society do not have a right, strictly speaking, to our love.</p>\n<p>Prof. Wolterstorff\u2019s argument, however, does seem to indicate that people have a right to our love, at very least insofar as justice is a part of love and a person has a right to justice. As such, if a person with whom I am in relationship has suffered the violation of their first-order rights to justice, I have a moral obligation to love them by pursuing second-order justice for that person. That sort of love of neighbor is not a matter of supererogatory piety; it is an obligation incumbent upon me, an obligation with a \u201cperemptory\u201d force. This sort of construal of love in relation to justice and rights creates a much stronger argument about the moral obligations of Christians towards survivors of injustices.</p>\n<h3>The Rights of the Displaced to Love and Justice</h3>\n<p>This line of reasoning is immensely applicable to the work of <em>Faith and Displacement </em>in mobilizing churches to foster the recuperation of the IDPs, especially because our foundational motivating arguments to the churches advance in close synchrony with the opening reflections on justice and love in Wolterstorff\u2019s Brief. When training churches as part of the <em>Faith and Displacement </em>project, I begin by introducing the concept of <em>shalom</em>\u2014holistically construed in terms of spiritual, material, emotional, and relational flourishing. I then move to Luke 4:16-21, to identify how Jesus (citing Isaiah 61:1-2) construed his own ministry in multidimensional fashion, entailing justice, economic well-being, political freedom, and emotional health.<a class=\"anchor\" id=\"content100note6anc\" name=\"content100note6anc\">\u00a0</a><a class=\"note\" href=\"#content100note6sym\">[\u00a06\u00a0]</a> These opening forays reveal a good deal of theological alignment with Prof. Wolterstorff\u2019s Brief.</p>\n<p>My next move in training churches, however, it to explore the Sheep and Goats Judgement of Matthew 25:31-46. This text commends itself to the topic of serving displaced persons because it speaks not only of the impecunious, but specifically includes the <em>xenoi</em>, foreigners or migrants. The basic argument this passage is twofold:</p>\n<p>I want to zero in on that second point. The King\u2019s argument in Matthew 25 is not that one is condemned for having deprived the hungry of bread, for having withheld water from the thirsty, for having stripped the naked, or infecting the sick or arresting the prisoner or expelling the migrant. Rather, the goats are condemned for having simply seen the hungry, naked, and migrant, and having done nothing.<a class=\"anchor\" id=\"content100note7anc\" name=\"content100note7anc\">\u00a0</a><a class=\"note\" href=\"#content100note7sym\">[\u00a07\u00a0]</a></p>\n<p>The logic of this text, claiming that one can be punished for not acting on behalf of the \u201cleast of these,\u201d implies that one has an obligation to the vulnerable. Acting on their behalf is not merely an expression of supererogatory charity; it is a morally binding duty, the neglect of which merits punishment. This text is thus neatly compatible with Prof. Wolterstorff\u2019s account of justice as a right that is a part of love.<a class=\"anchor\" id=\"content100note8anc\" name=\"content100note8anc\">\u00a0</a><a class=\"note\" href=\"#content100note8sym\">[\u00a08\u00a0]</a> Interpreting Matthew 25 for the 21<sup>st</sup> century, it would not distort the text to construe \u201cthe least of these\u201d as people with a right to food, water, and clothing (matters of justice) as well as to being visited in prison and welcomed as strangers (matters of love more broadly). We who see the least of these, whether as members of the body of Christ or of Colombian society, have moral duties to act justly and lovingly towards them, both in terms of our daily first-order dealings with them, and in terms of pursuing second-order justice for them when the State has failed to provide it.</p>\n<h2>Conclusion</h2>\n<p>Prof. Wolterstorff\u2019s brief provides a nuanced account of rights\u2014replete with distinctions between first and second orders, agents and claimants/patients, rights and duties, collectives and individuals\u2014that is poignant for this theologian, working to mobilize churches in response to the Colombian displacement crisis. To explore how this might be the case, I have taken the liberty drawing out some points that seemed implicit in Wolterstorff\u2019s argumentation, specifically venturing that members of collectives share the moral obligations of their collective (e.g., citizens share some of the moral responsibilities of their governments) and also suggesting that (within Wolterstorff\u2019s construal of justice as a part of love) people\u2019s right to justice also implies a right to love. These insights strengthen the case that Colombian citizens, especially Colombian believers, are morally obligated to act on behalf of Colombian IDPs, and in such a fashion as comports with the intrinsic excellencies of those displaced persons. And although Colombia, like any other nation, has distinctive cultural and political features, I would wager that the reflections above are pertinent to any number of nations in which rights discourse is prominent and in which the Church finds itself sliding into passivity in the face of injustice. Such contexts are, lamentably, not few.</p>\n<p>In closing, allow me to venture an exhortation for seminaries. Most institutions of theological education have a strong sense that, by training church leaders, they are serving the good of society, like leaven in dough. This strikes me as true. But our efficacy is often blunted by our tendency to silo ourselves off from other academic disciplines. <em>Faith and Displacement </em>is one seminary\u2019s attempt to learn deeply from diverse social-scientific disciplines, at the levels of theory, practice, and empirical verification. The Faculty Initiative has the potential to facilitate much the same thing, albeit in relation to a much wider range of disciplines and topics. The Faculty Initiative invites the seminary professor to contribute her or his theological knowledge to believers in other academic disciplines, as well as to receive help from those believing scholars with diverse specialties, in order to be more effective in serving the mission of the Church in the world. It is an invitation to see interdisciplinary study, not as a niche endeavor for fringe theologians, but as an opportunity to speak more truly about God, if we believe that all truth is God\u2019s truth.<a class=\"anchor\" id=\"content100note9anc\" name=\"content100note9anc\">\u00a0</a><a class=\"note\" href=\"#content100note9sym\">[\u00a09\u00a0]</a> I think we\u2019d be foolish to pass it up.</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<h2 class=\"new_page\">References</h2>\n<p class=\"reference\">Cadavid Valencia, Laura Milena, and Iv\u00f3n Natalia Cuervo. <em>Enfoque y metodolog\u00edas participativas, dar voz a las comunidades</em>. 2<sup>nd</sup> ed.

    "bodyText": "Let\u2019s begin with a brief overview of Wolterstorff\u2019s conception of justice, which, on his view, is centrally concerned with equitable treatment: the virtue of justice disposes its possessors to recognize one\u2019s duty to respect others\u2019 legitimate claims to non-interference (permission rights) or to the active provision of some good (claim rights). Wolterstorff emphasizes the prominence within the Old Testament of injunctions to do \u201cjustice ( mishpat ),\u201d a term which \u201cis often paired with \u2018 tsedaqah ,\u2019 standardly translated as righteousness\u201d; [\u00a03\u00a0] the conjunction of the two might be translated, following David Novak\u2019s suggestion, as \u201ccorrect justice.\u201d [\u00a04\u00a0] Throughout the Old Testament, tsedaqah and mishpat are repeatedly related to attitudes, practices, and institutions shaped above all by fairness and impartiality.\n\nIn the Torah, as still today, both attributes are depicted as embodied first and foremost in law-courts: \u201cYou shall not render an unjust judgment ( mishpat ); you shall not be partial to the poor or defer to the great: with justice ( tsedeq ) you shall judge your neighbor\u201d (Lev. 19:15, cf. also Exod. 23:2 and Deut. 1:16-17). [\u00a05\u00a0] This requirement of impartiality was married to a concern for proportionality in sentencing: not only should each person be treated equally to others who are like him in the relevant respects, but each person should be treated in a manner commensurate with his own actions: \u201cYou shall give life for life, eye for eye, tooth for tooth, hand for hand, foot for foot\u201d (Exod. 21:23-24). [\u00a06\u00a0] And in Deuteronomy, this requirement of proportionality is used to rule out any notion of inherited or transferrable guilt: \u201cThe fathers shall not be put to death for the children, neither shall the children be put to death for the fathers: every man shall be put to death for his own sin\u201d (Deut. 24:16).\n\nMishpat , Wolterstorff shows, consists not only in the judicial remedies meted out to those who have been wronged (rectifying justice), but also in the objectively right state of affairs which the remedies are designed to restore (primary justice). [\u00a07\u00a0] One biblical passage in which \u201c mishpat \u201d unambiguously refers to primary justice is the famous injunction in Micah: \u201cHe has showed you, O man, what is good; and what does the Lord require of you but to do justice, and to love kindness, and to walk humbly with your God?\u201d (6:8) Here, the addressee is a universal \u201cman,\u201d not a judge, and so it seems unlikely that the \u201cjustice\u201d in view is the rectifying justice dispensed by the courts. [\u00a08\u00a0]\n\nWe\u2019re now in a position to consider our presenting question: does God abide by this standard of \u201ccorrect justice\u201d to which he holds us? Does he render to each according to his due? The early Judahite exiles to Babylon had real doubts about this, at least as they were depicted by the prophets Jeremiah and his younger contemporary, the priest Ezekiel. Ezekiel 18 in particular consists of an oracle addressed to Israel by God himself, and opens with God\u2019s own complaint about a proverb \u2013 \u201cThe fathers ate sour grapes and the children\u2019s teeth are set on edge\u201d \u2013 then current among the exiles (18:2-3, cf. Jer. 31:28-30). The proverb\u2019s meaning is clear: \u201cOur fathers sinned, but only we are punished.\u201d\n\nThe exiles, it must be said, had some grounds for this complaint: at Sinai, after all, God had promised to \u201cvisit the iniquity of the fathers upon the sons, even to the third and fourth generations\u201d (Exod. 20:5). Indeed, the author of the Kings-cycle brings this apparent incongruity to the surface of his narrative. \u201cBefore [Josiah] there was no king like him,\u201d he observes, \u201cwho turned to the LORD with all his heart and with all his soul and with all his might, according to all the law of Moses.\u201d Nonetheless, \u201cthe LORD did not turn from the fierceness of his great wrath, by which his anger was kindled against Judah, because of all the provocations with which Manasseh had provoked him\u201d (2 Kings 23:25-26).\n\nIn Ezekiel 18, however, the LORD emphatically repudiates this visitation of one man\u2019s sins upon another: \u201cAs I live, says the Lord GOD, this proverb,\u201d about the sour grapes, \u201cshall no more be used by you in Israel\u201d (18:3). He insists instead, \u201cBehold, all souls are mine; the soul of the father as well as the soul of the son is mine: the soul that sins shall die\u201d (18:4). God too respects the judicial principle set out in Deuteronomy 24:16: if the son of such a just man works evil, then that son will die (18:10-13). But if that son has a son who turns away from his father\u2019s evils and does what is right, then he shall live (18:14-17). In short, \u201cThe son shall not bear the iniquity of the father, neither shall the father bear the iniquity of the son: the righteousness of the righteous shall be upon him, and the wickedness of the wicked shall be upon him\u201d (18:20). This non-transference of evil and righteousness, applies even within the life of an individual: past righteousness will not ensure a favorable judgment for the one who turns to wickedness, and by the same token, past wickedness is no bar to a favorable judgment in the one who repents and does what is right (18:21, 24).\n\nAfter delivering his threefold declaration that each righteous and wicked person will receive his fitting return, the LORD summarizes his warning to Israel: \u201cTherefore I will judge you, O house of Israel, every one according to his ways, saith the Lord GOD. Repent, and turn yourselves from all your transgressions; so iniquity shall not be your ruin\u201d (18:30). This, of course, is simply the general principle underlying the earlier teachings: the righteous son will not be judged according to the father\u2019s wickedness, nor the wicked son according to the father\u2019s righteousness; each will be judged according to his own conduct. God, in other words, is in fact committed to the principle of impartial and equitable judgment by which he commanded Israel\u2019s judges to abide (cf. Deut. 24:16).\n\nGod\u2019s commitment to judge according to an individual\u2019s works is not unique to Ezekiel; indeed, while it does not appear explicitly in the Torah, it is scattered liberally through the Psalms and Proverbs, particularly in Psalm 62, which concludes with a \u201ccomfortable word\u201d: \u201cTo thee, O Lord, belongs steadfast love. For thou dost requite a man according to his work\u201d (62:12). Psalm 62 comes the closest any Old Testament text to Ulpian\u2019s definition of justice as rights-rendering. Indeed, the LXX rendering so closely aligns with Plato\u2019s formulation of that principle that it seems possible that the translator specifically sought to evoke that philosophical tradition:\n\n\u201cWith you, Lord, is mercy ( \u00e9leos ), for you will render to each ( apod\u014dseis hek\u00e1st\u014d ) according to his works\u201d (Ps. 62:12, LXX).\n\n\u201cIt is just ( dikaion ) to render to each ( hek\u00e1st\u014d apodid\u00f3nai ) his dues.\u201d [\u00a09\u00a0]\n\nIf justice is rendering to each according to his due, then the LORD is just; like the judges he raises up for Israel, he is impartial, treating each according to the same standard, namely what is owed to them ( ta opheil\u00f3mena ) as a result of their works. [\u00a010\u00a0] But this justice is equally merciful, an expression of God\u2019s love. \u201cA man\u2019s work is his character,\u201d as George Macdonald observes, \u201cand God in his mercy is not indifferent, but treats him according to his work.\u201d [\u00a011\u00a0]\n\nEzekiel and the Psalmist insist that God does in fact abide by correct justice in his dealings with us; he renders to each according to his works. Nonetheless, might not this Old Testament insistence on the justice of God be less a promise than a threat of the Law, whose fearsome commands cannot be borne, and which must be superseded by the gracious and forgiving Gospel? Doesn\u2019t the New Testament teach that God treats us not with justice, but rather with mercy and grace? After all, if God rendered to each according to his works, who could be saved?\n\nPaul did, of course, write that \u201cno human being will be justified in his sight by works of the law\u201d (Rom. 3:20), which Martin Luther famously read as teaching that \u201ca Christian has all he needs in faith and needs no works to justify him,\u201d [\u00a012\u00a0] and about which he wrote, \u201cif that article stands, the Church stands; if it falls, the Church falls.\u201d [\u00a013\u00a0] But then, Paul wrote this injunction just one chapter after quoting Psalm 62\u2019s declaration that God \u201cwill render to each according to his works\u201d (Rom. 2:6), and then insisting, \u201cIt is not the hearers of the law who are just before God, but the doers of the law who will be justified\u201d (2:13), a statement which might seem to be more at home in the Epistle of James (cf. 1:22, 2:24) than in Romans. In short, the juxtaposition of Romans 2:13 with Romans 3:20 seems to present us with a dilemma: in the divine law-court, is my case dismissed on the basis of my faith, apart from \u201cworks of the Law,\u201d or am I instead acquitted as a \u201cdoer of the Law\u201d? [\u00a014\u00a0]\n\nIn his Justice in Love , Wolterstorff acknowledges the apparent tension between these passages, and seeks to interpret Paul\u2019s talk of the reward given \u201cthose who do good\u201d (Rom. 2:11) so as to make it consistent with Rom. 3:20:\n\nWho are these people who patiently do good and who are, on that account, given eternal life, glory, honor, and peace? [cf. Rom. 2:11] They cannot be those who, in the words of 3:20, do all the \u2018deeds ( erg\u014dn ) prescribed by the law,\u2019 since there are none such, Christ excepted\u2026I think the conclusion is irresistible that the people Paul has in mind when he speaks of those who patiently do good are those that he will shortly speak of as people who have faith in God; they are the ones who see fit to acknowledge God. [\u00a015\u00a0]\n\nBut this re-reading of Romans 2:11-13 runs into the difficulty that Paul immediately goes on, perhaps in Romans 2:14-15, but certainly in Romans 2:26-29, to describe a class of Gentiles who \u201ckeep the ordinances of the Law\u201d (2:26) and who possess the Spirit (2:29), i.e., who are Gentile Christians like those in his own congregation.\n\nWolterstorff, here standing well within the mainstream of Pauline interpreters, thus has Paul 1) maintaining that \u201cdoers of the Law will be justified\u201d (Rom. 2:13); and 2) immediately describing a group of people who are \u201cin the Spirit\u201d (Rom. 2:29) and in fact \u201ckeep the Law\u2019s ordinances\u201d (Rom. 2:26); but 3) nonetheless insisting that they are not justified insofar as they are doers of the Law (Rom. 3:20), but only insofar as they are believers in Christ (Rom. 3:24). In view of points one and two, why is three necessary? The Paul who emerges from this interpretation seems conflicted, perhaps even confused. [\u00a016\u00a0]\n\nIt seems to me, however, that there is a more excellent way of resolving the apparent contradiction between Rom. 2:13 and 3:20. Recall that, in Romans 2, Paul describes the Gentiles who \u201ckeep the just requirements of the Law\u201d (Rom. 2:26) as possessing \u201cthe circumcision of the heart, in the Spirit, not the letter.\u201d [\u00a017\u00a0] Here the contrast is not between \u201cfaith\u201d and \u201cworks of the Law,\u201d but rather between circumcision \u201cin the Spirit\u201d and \u201cin the letter.\u201d Paul alludes here to a distinction he states more clearly in 2 Corinthians 3:6: in itself, as a mere external letter, the Law kills ( gr\u00e1mma apokt\u00e9nnei , 2 Cor. 3:6), but as written on one\u2019s heart by the Spirit (2 Cor. 3:3), it gives life ( pne\u00fbma z\u014dopoie\u00ee ) (2 Cor. 3:6).\n\nAs Lloyd Gaston and now more recently Paul Owen and Peter Leithart have proposed, we should allow Paul\u2019s claims that \u201cthe letter kills\u201d (2 Cor. 3:6), or that \u201cthe Law works ( katerg\u00e1zetai ) wrath\u201d (Rom. 4:15) to interpret his statements elsewhere about \u201cthe works of the Law.\u201d After all, it is not only possible but even natural, from a grammatical standpoint, to interpret Paul\u2019s \u201cworks of the Law,\u201d not as an attributive genitive (\u201cworks in accord with the Law\u201d), but instead as a subjective genitive, \u201cthe Law\u2019s works,\u201d or even \u201cwhat the Law does.\u201d [\u00a018\u00a0] And, as Gaston rightly emphasizes, Paul has a great deal to say just in Romans about what the Law does: it \u201ccloses every mouth and makes the whole world stand guilty (3:19)\u2026brings knowledge of sin (3:20)\u2026charges sin (5:13)\u2026increases Adam\u2019s fault (5:20)\u2026has authority over a human being (7:1)\u2026provides an occasion for sin (7:8, 9)\u2026deceives (7:11)\u2026[and] kills (7:11).\u201d [\u00a019\u00a0] Small wonder that the Law\u2019s works do not justify humanity!\n\nThe problem of the Law\u2019s inflaming sin is arguably in view in the context of Romans 3:20, which maintains that \u201cby works of the Law no flesh will be justified.\u201d Paul here discusses a particular activity of the Law, which is to address its subjects so as to shut every mouth (3:19) and to usher in the knowledge of sin (3:20). Indeed, it seems reasonable to view the chain of Old Testament passages on human sinfulness Paul assembles in Romans 3:10-18 as supplying the content of \u201cwhat the Law says\u201d (3:19). [\u00a020\u00a0] But in that context, a sudden comment on \u201c[human] works according to the Law\u201d would imply a change of subject twice in the span of two verses. By contrast, interpreting \u201c \u00e9rga nomo\u00fb \u201d as \u201cthe Law\u2019s works\u201d yields a single, seamless line of thought in Romans 3:19-20: the Law silences humanity in their sin and makes them liable before God (3:19), and so we aren\u2019t justified through what the Law does (3:20a), since the Law brings only the knowledge of sin (3:20b).\n\nSo, there is no ultimate contradiction: none are justified by what the Law does (Rom. 3:20), despite the fact that it is the doers of the Law who will be justified, when God renders to each according to his works (Rom. 2:6, 13). If space allowed, I would go on \u2013 as I do in The Accountable Animal \u2013 to describe what it means that \u201cthe just requirement of the law is fulfilled in those who walk\u2026according to the Spirit\u201d (Rom. 8:4), and how that relates to Paul\u2019s account of faith in Christ and to the proleptic death-and-resurrection of baptism. But I hope that even this brief discussion has rendered plausible the view that, for Paul as much as Ezekiel, God himself conforms to the standard of justice to which Wolterstorff has rightly indicated that he holds humanity, and this not in spite but precisely because of his mercy.\n\n[\u00a01\u00a0] The following is adapted, with permission, from my book, The Accountable Animal: Justice, Justification, and Judgment (T&T Clark, 2021).\n\n[\u00a02\u00a0] Cf. his Justice: Rights and Wrongs (Princeton University Press, 2009) and Justice in Love (Eerdmans, 2011). Ulpian\u2019s definition is found in the Corpus iuris civilis 1.1.10. The definition was perhaps first entertained (and rejected) by Plato ( Republic 331e), but it was endorsed by Cicero, who seems to have made it normative for the Latin-speaking philosophical tradition ( De Finibius 5.65, De Natura Deorum 3.38).\n\n[\u00a03\u00a0] Justice , 69.\n\n[\u00a04\u00a0] Natural Law in Judaism , quoted in Wolterstorff, Justice , 69.\n\n[\u00a05\u00a0] Wolterstorff, Justice , 77.\n\n[\u00a06\u00a0] Cf.

The emphasis in this turn of phrase would then lie not so much on human failure fully to obey the Law (though that is implied) as on the Law\u2019s own inability (owing to the gripping power of sin) to produce in people a righteousness that can survive before the bar of God\u2019s judgment\u201d (Owen, \u201cThe \u2018Works of the Law\u2019 in Romans and Galatians,\u201d 554).

Wolterstorff emphasizes the prominence within the Old Testament of injunctions to do \u201cjustice (<i>mishpat</i>),\u201d a term which \u201cis often paired with \u2018<i>tsedaqah</i>,\u2019 standardly translated as righteousness\u201d;<a class=\"anchor\" id=\"content100note3anc\" name=\"content100note3anc\">\u00a0</a><a class=\"note\" href=\"#content100note3sym\">[\u00a03\u00a0]</a> the conjunction of the two might be translated, following David Novak\u2019s suggestion, as \u201ccorrect justice.\u201d<a class=\"anchor\" id=\"content100note4anc\" name=\"content100note4anc\">\u00a0</a><a class=\"note\" href=\"#content100note4sym\">[\u00a04\u00a0]</a> Throughout the Old Testament, <i>tsedaqah </i>and <i>mishpat </i>are repeatedly related to attitudes, practices, and institutions shaped above all by fairness and impartiality.</p>\n<p>In the Torah, as still today, both attributes are depicted as embodied first and foremost in law-courts: \u201cYou shall not render an unjust judgment (<i>mishpat</i>); you shall not be partial to the poor or defer to the great: with justice (<i>tsedeq</i>) you shall judge your neighbor\u201d (Lev. 19:15, cf. also Exod. 23:2 and Deut. 1:16-17).<a class=\"anchor\" id=\"content100note5anc\" name=\"content100note5anc\">\u00a0</a><a class=\"note\" href=\"#content100note5sym\">[\u00a05\u00a0]</a> This requirement of impartiality was married to a concern for proportionality in sentencing: not only should each person be treated equally to others who are like him in the relevant respects, but each person should be treated in a manner commensurate with his own actions: \u201cYou shall give life for life, eye for eye, tooth for tooth, hand for hand, foot for foot\u201d (Exod. 21:23-24).<a class=\"anchor\" id=\"content100note6anc\" name=\"content100note6anc\">\u00a0</a><a class=\"note\" href=\"#content100note6sym\">[\u00a06\u00a0]</a> And in Deuteronomy, this requirement of proportionality is used to rule out any notion of inherited or transferrable guilt: \u201cThe fathers shall not be put to death for the children, neither shall the children be put to death for the fathers: every man shall be put to death for his own sin\u201d (Deut. 24:16).</p>\n<p><i>Mishpat</i>, Wolterstorff shows, consists not only in the judicial remedies meted out to those who have been wronged (rectifying justice), but also in the objectively right state of affairs which the remedies are designed to restore (primary justice).<a class=\"anchor\" id=\"content100note7anc\" name=\"content100note7anc\">\u00a0</a><a class=\"note\" href=\"#content100note7sym\">[\u00a07\u00a0]</a> One biblical passage in which \u201c<i>mishpat</i>\u201d<i> </i>unambiguously refers to primary justice is the famous injunction in Micah: \u201cHe has showed you, O man, what is good; and what does the Lord require of you but to do justice, and to love kindness, and to walk humbly with your God?\u201d (6:8) Here, the addressee is a universal \u201cman,\u201d not a judge, and so it seems unlikely that the \u201cjustice\u201d in view is the rectifying justice dispensed by the courts.<a class=\"anchor\" id=\"content100note8anc\" name=\"content100note8anc\">\u00a0</a><a class=\"note\" href=\"#content100note8sym\">[\u00a08\u00a0]</a></p>\n<h2>Does God Render to Each according to His Right?</h2>\n<p>We\u2019re now in a position to consider our presenting question: does God abide by this standard of \u201ccorrect justice\u201d to which he holds us? Does he render to each according to his due? The early Judahite exiles to Babylon had real doubts about this, at least as they were depicted by the prophets Jeremiah and his younger contemporary, the priest Ezekiel. Ezekiel 18 in particular consists of an oracle addressed to Israel by God himself, and opens with God\u2019s own complaint about a proverb \u2013 \u201cThe fathers ate sour grapes and the children\u2019s teeth are set on edge\u201d \u2013 then current among the exiles (18:2-3, cf. Jer. 31:28-30). The proverb\u2019s meaning is clear: \u201cOur fathers sinned, but only we are punished.\u201d</p>\n<p>The exiles, it must be said, had some grounds for this complaint: at Sinai, after all, God had promised to \u201cvisit the iniquity of the fathers upon the sons, even to the third and fourth generations\u201d (Exod. 20:5). Indeed, the author of the Kings-cycle brings this apparent incongruity to the surface of his narrative. \u201cBefore [Josiah] there was no king like him,\u201d he observes, \u201cwho turned to the LORD with all his heart and with all his soul and with all his might, according to all the law of Moses.\u201d Nonetheless, \u201cthe LORD did not turn from the fierceness of his great wrath, by which his anger was kindled against Judah, because of all the provocations with which Manasseh had provoked him\u201d (2 Kings 23:25-26).</p>\n<p>In Ezekiel 18, however, the LORD emphatically repudiates this visitation of one man\u2019s sins upon another: \u201cAs I live, says the Lord GOD, this proverb,\u201d about the sour grapes, \u201cshall no more be used by you in Israel\u201d (18:3). He insists instead, \u201cBehold, all souls are mine; the soul of the father as well as the soul of the son is mine: the soul that sins shall die\u201d (18:4). God too respects the judicial principle set out in Deuteronomy 24:16: if the son of such a just man works evil, then that son will die (18:10-13). But if that son has a son who turns away from his father\u2019s evils and does what is right, then he shall live (18:14-17). In short, \u201cThe son shall not bear the iniquity of the father, neither shall the father bear the iniquity of the son: the righteousness of the righteous shall be upon him, and the wickedness of the wicked shall be upon him\u201d (18:20). This non-transference of evil and righteousness, applies even within the life of an individual: past righteousness will not ensure a favorable judgment for the one who turns to wickedness, and by the same token, past wickedness is no bar to a favorable judgment in the one who repents and does what is right (18:21, 24).</p>\n<p>After delivering his threefold declaration that each righteous and wicked person will receive his fitting return, the LORD summarizes his warning to Israel: \u201cTherefore I will judge you, O house of Israel, every one according to his ways, saith the Lord GOD. Repent, and turn yourselves from all your transgressions; so iniquity shall not be your ruin\u201d (18:30). This, of course, is simply the general principle underlying the earlier teachings: the righteous son will not be judged according to the father\u2019s wickedness, nor the wicked son according to the father\u2019s righteousness; each will be judged according to his own conduct. God, in other words, is in fact committed to the principle of impartial and equitable judgment by which he commanded Israel\u2019s judges to abide (cf. Deut. 24:16).</p>\n<p>God\u2019s commitment to judge according to an individual\u2019s works is not unique to Ezekiel; indeed, while it does not appear explicitly in the Torah, it is scattered liberally through the Psalms and Proverbs, particularly in Psalm 62, which concludes with a \u201ccomfortable word\u201d: \u201cTo thee, O Lord, belongs steadfast love. For thou dost requite a man according to his work\u201d (62:12). Psalm 62 comes the closest any Old Testament text to Ulpian\u2019s definition of justice as rights-rendering. Indeed, the LXX rendering so closely aligns with Plato\u2019s formulation of that principle that it seems possible that the translator specifically sought to evoke that philosophical tradition:</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>\u201cWith you, Lord, is mercy (<i>\u00e9leos</i>), for you will render to each (<i>apod\u014dseis hek\u00e1st\u014d</i>)<i> </i>according to his works\u201d (Ps. 62:12, LXX).</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>\u201cWith you, Lord, is mercy (<i>\u00e9leos</i>), for you will render to each (<i>apod\u014dseis hek\u00e1st\u014d</i>)<i> </i>according to his works\u201d (Ps. 62:12, LXX).</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>\u201cIt is just (<i>dikaion</i>) to render to each (<i>hek\u00e1st\u014d apodid\u00f3nai</i>) his dues.\u201d<a class=\"anchor\" id=\"content100note9anc\" name=\"content100note9anc\">\u00a0</a><a class=\"note\" href=\"#content100note9sym\">[\u00a09\u00a0]</a></p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>\u201cIt is just (<i>dikaion</i>) to render to each (<i>hek\u00e1st\u014d apodid\u00f3nai</i>) his dues.\u201d<a class=\"anchor\" id=\"content100note9anc\" name=\"content100note9anc\">\u00a0</a><a class=\"note\" href=\"#content100note9sym\">[\u00a09\u00a0]</a></p>\n<p>If justice is rendering to each according to his due, then the LORD is just; like the judges he raises up for Israel, he is impartial, treating each according to the same standard, namely what is owed to them (<i>ta opheil\u00f3mena</i>) as a result of their works.<a class=\"anchor\" id=\"content100note10anc\" name=\"content100note10anc\">\u00a0</a><a class=\"note\" href=\"#content100note10sym\">[\u00a010\u00a0]</a> But this justice is equally merciful, an expression of God\u2019s love. \u201cA man\u2019s work is his character,\u201d as George Macdonald observes, \u201cand God in his mercy is not indifferent, but treats him according to his work.\u201d<a class=\"anchor\" id=\"content100note11anc\" name=\"content100note11anc\">\u00a0</a><a class=\"note\" href=\"#content100note11sym\">[\u00a011\u00a0]</a></p>\n<h2>A Pauline Dilemma regarding Judgment according to Works</h2>\n<p>Ezekiel and the Psalmist insist that God does in fact abide by correct justice in his dealings with us; he renders to each according to his works. Nonetheless, might not this Old Testament insistence on the justice of God be less a promise than a threat of the Law, whose fearsome commands cannot be borne, and which must be superseded by the gracious and forgiving Gospel? Doesn\u2019t the New Testament teach that God treats us not with justice, but rather with mercy and grace? After all, if God rendered to each according to his works, who could be saved?</p>\n<p>Paul did, of course, write that \u201cno human being will be justified in his sight by works of the law\u201d (Rom. 3:20), which Martin Luther famously read as teaching that \u201ca Christian has all he needs in faith and needs no works to justify him,\u201d<a class=\"anchor\" id=\"content100note12anc\" name=\"content100note12anc\">\u00a0</a><a class=\"note\" href=\"#content100note12sym\">[\u00a012\u00a0]</a> and about which he wrote, \u201cif that article stands, the Church stands; if it falls, the Church falls.\u201d<a class=\"anchor\" id=\"content100note13anc\" name=\"content100note13anc\">\u00a0</a><a class=\"note\" href=\"#content100note13sym\">[\u00a013\u00a0]</a> But then, Paul wrote this injunction just one chapter after quoting Psalm 62\u2019s declaration that God \u201cwill render to each according to his works\u201d (Rom. 2:6), and then insisting, \u201cIt is not the hearers of the law who are just before God, but the doers of the law who will be justified\u201d (2:13), a statement which might seem to be more at home in the Epistle of James (cf. 1:22, 2:24) than in Romans. In short, the juxtaposition of Romans 2:13 with Romans 3:20 seems to present us with a dilemma: in the divine law-court, is my case dismissed on the basis of my faith, apart from \u201cworks of the Law,\u201d or am I instead acquitted as a \u201cdoer of the Law\u201d?<a class=\"anchor\" id=\"content100note14anc\" name=\"content100note14anc\">\u00a0</a><a class=\"note\" href=\"#content100note14sym\">[\u00a014\u00a0]</a></p>\n<p>In his <i>Justice in Love</i>,<i> </i>Wolterstorff acknowledges the apparent tension between these passages, and seeks to interpret Paul\u2019s talk of the reward given \u201cthose who do good\u201d (Rom. 2:11) so as to make it consistent with Rom. 3:20:</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>Who are these people who patiently do good and who are, on that account, given eternal life, glory, honor, and peace?

Recall that, in Romans 2, Paul describes the Gentiles who \u201ckeep the just requirements of the Law\u201d (Rom. 2:26) as possessing \u201cthe circumcision of the heart, in the Spirit, not the letter.\u201d<a class=\"anchor\" id=\"content100note17anc\" name=\"content100note17anc\">\u00a0</a><a class=\"note\" href=\"#content100note17sym\">[\u00a017\u00a0]</a> Here the contrast is not between \u201cfaith\u201d and \u201cworks of the Law,\u201d but rather between circumcision \u201cin the Spirit\u201d and \u201cin the letter.\u201d Paul alludes here to a distinction he states more clearly in 2 Corinthians 3:6: in itself, as a mere external letter, the Law kills (<i>gr\u00e1mma apokt\u00e9nnei</i>, 2 Cor. 3:6), but as written on one\u2019s heart by the Spirit (2 Cor. 3:3), it gives life (<i>pne\u00fbma z\u014dopoie\u00ee</i>) (2 Cor. 3:6).</p>\n<p>As Lloyd Gaston and now more recently Paul Owen and Peter Leithart have proposed, we should allow Paul\u2019s claims that \u201cthe letter kills\u201d (2 Cor. 3:6), or that \u201cthe Law works (<i>katerg\u00e1zetai</i>) wrath\u201d (Rom. 4:15) to interpret his statements elsewhere about \u201cthe works of the Law.\u201d After all, it is not only possible but even natural, from a grammatical standpoint, to interpret Paul\u2019s \u201cworks of the Law,\u201d not as an attributive genitive (\u201cworks in accord with the Law\u201d), but instead as a <i>subjective </i>genitive, \u201cthe Law\u2019s works,\u201d or even \u201cwhat the Law does.\u201d<a class=\"anchor\" id=\"content100note18anc\" name=\"content100note18anc\">\u00a0</a><a class=\"note\" href=\"#content100note18sym\">[\u00a018\u00a0]</a> And, as Gaston rightly emphasizes, Paul has a great deal to say just in Romans about what the Law does: it \u201ccloses every mouth and makes the whole world stand guilty (3:19)\u2026brings knowledge of sin (3:20)\u2026charges sin (5:13)\u2026increases Adam\u2019s fault (5:20)\u2026has authority over a human being (7:1)\u2026provides an occasion for sin (7:8, 9)\u2026deceives (7:11)\u2026[and] kills (7:11).\u201d<a class=\"anchor\" id=\"content100note19anc\" name=\"content100note19anc\">\u00a0</a><a class=\"note\" href=\"#content100note19sym\">[\u00a019\u00a0]</a> Small wonder that the Law\u2019s works do not justify humanity!</p>\n<p>The problem of the Law\u2019s inflaming sin is arguably in view in the context of Romans 3:20, which maintains that \u201cby works of the Law no flesh will be justified.\u201d Paul here discusses a particular activity of the Law, which is to address its subjects so as to shut every mouth (3:19) and to usher in the knowledge of sin (3:20). Indeed, it seems reasonable to view the chain of Old Testament passages on human sinfulness Paul assembles in Romans 3:10-18 as supplying the content of \u201cwhat the Law says\u201d (3:19).<a class=\"anchor\" id=\"content100note20anc\" name=\"content100note20anc\">\u00a0</a><a class=\"note\" href=\"#content100note20sym\">[\u00a020\u00a0]</a> But in that context, a sudden comment on \u201c[human] works according to the Law\u201d would imply a change of subject twice in the span of two verses. By contrast, interpreting \u201c<i>\u00e9rga nomo\u00fb</i>\u201d as \u201cthe Law\u2019s works\u201d yields a single, seamless line of thought in Romans 3:19-20: the Law silences humanity in their sin and makes them liable before God (3:19), and so we aren\u2019t justified through what the Law does (3:20a), since the Law brings only the knowledge of sin (3:20b).<i> </i></p>\n<p>So, there is no ultimate contradiction: none are justified by what the Law does (Rom. 3:20), despite the fact that it is the doers of the Law who will be justified, when God renders to each according to his works (Rom. 2:6, 13). If space allowed, I would go on \u2013 as I do in <i>The Accountable Animal</i> \u2013 to describe what it means that \u201cthe just requirement of the law is fulfilled in those who walk\u2026according to the Spirit\u201d (Rom. 8:4), and how that relates to Paul\u2019s account of faith in Christ and to the proleptic death-and-resurrection of baptism. But I hope that even this brief discussion has rendered plausible the view that, for Paul as much as Ezekiel, God himself conforms to the standard of justice to which Wolterstorff has rightly indicated that he holds humanity, and this not in spite but precisely because of his mercy.</p>\n<h2 class=\"new_page\">End Notes</h2>\n<p class=\"endnote\"><a class=\"note\" href=\"#content100note1anc\">[\u00a01\u00a0]</a><a class=\"anchor\" id=\"content100note1sym\" name=\"content100note1sym\">\u00a0</a> The following is adapted, with permission, from my book, <i>The Accountable Animal: Justice, Justification, and Judgment</i> (T&amp;T Clark, 2021).</p>\n<p class=\"endnote\"><a class=\"note\" href=\"#content100note2anc\">[\u00a02\u00a0]</a><a class=\"anchor\" id=\"content100note2sym\" name=\"content100note2sym\">\u00a0</a> Cf. his <i>Justice: Rights and Wrongs </i>(Princeton University Press, 2009) and <i>Justice in Love </i>(Eerdmans, 2011).

    "bodyText": "Prof. Wolterstorff helpfully points out that justice is based on healthy and well-ordered relationships between persons. For Thomas Aquinas, the medieval theologian influenced by Aristotle and Augustine, such order emerges from natural human inclinations to seek happiness in virtuous and constructive ways, through relationships of affability and love of friendship, within the framework of collective lives based around goods shared in common. [See Summa Theologiae II-II, qq. 58, 61] A human family, for example, is a kind of common good in which each person can flourish through affable and caring relationships, friendships of the spouses and parental friendships with children in their care. Based on such relations, an order of justice emerges. Parents, for example, normally owe certain standards of care and education to their children. Spouses normally owe one another a certain degree of engagement and genuine fidelity. The relationships between persons in this context amount to more than relationships of justice but they include and are supported by fundamental relations of justice. Aristotle notes that friendship and love are more than justice can provide but they cannot be sustained without basic justice.\n\nThis first case is familial but one could extend the examples to include collective organizations of work, education, or statecraft. In any of these cases, one may speak analogically of various forms of justice, not one form alone. There is justice that results (1) from the part to the whole (which I will call participatory justice), (2) the part to the part (which he calls commutative justice), and (3) the whole to the part (distributive justice). However can we illustrate each of these cases inductively from examples?\n\n(1) Participatory justice: the part to the whole\n\nThe person (considered as part) who participates in a larger common good (the whole life of the city, the family, the workplace, the university) incurs obligations and responsibilities toward the whole, precisely as a beneficiary participant. In this case each person has a role to play in contributing to the larger group. It is reasonable for example that a city or state ask its citizens to pay taxes, or that a family asks its children to participate in a common family outing. An academic is expected to creatively contribute to the university in teaching and writing or in administrative work. Diverse nation states need to work together collectively within the framework of a larger international common good, so that all states contribute constructively to peace, international justice, and economic prosperity.\n\n(2) Commutative justice : the part to the part\n\nEach member of the collective community has obligations and rights vis a vis one another as individuals. The most common example of this is in exchanges, as when one is expected to pay a just price for something one purchases or one is owed a just wage for work one does. However this notion is flexible and somewhat analogical, applying to various forms of equality. The spouses have equal rights and responsibilities in justice to one another within a marriage bond. Two academics who write a paper or edit a book together have a kind of equal share in the reputation and effect of the book. Two nation states need to show mutual respect and just concord in relations with one another, be they economic or political.\n\n(3) Distributive justice: the whole to the part\n\nThe whole has obligations to each individual, depending upon the needs and capacities of the individual in question. This is the kind of justice that typically comes to the forefront in questions of political policy. Any common good has some representative leadership that represents the whole and makes decisions in view of the common good of the whole. In doing so they have to think about the qualities, capacities and limitations or needs of individuals and sub-groups. Parents in a family need to think of the just distribution of needs for an infant versus a teenager who may need tutoring versus a child with athletic or artistic talents they legitimately wish to develop. A university administration can distribute scholarships prudently in view of a diverse representation of students, and can distribute grants, honors or responsibilities among academics in view of representative academic excellence. The state has social obligations to various groups of people who are more vulnerable or who require distinct kinds of advocacy: the disabled, the poor, the socially marginalized. Any given country needs to respect the subsidiary and self-determination of small collective groups and institutions within its polity. Wealthier or more powerful nation states should think rightly of how to incorporate more materially disadvantaged or less developed nations within the larger collective common good of deliberation and exchange.\n\nThis idea of justice presupposes some form of human exceptionalism: there is a reason human beings are agents and recipients of justice, due to their dignity as intellectual and free animals, able to live constructively or destructively with one another. This means that any realistic notion of justice cannot be merely procedural or formal, politically convenient or conventional, but must be grounded in a viable claim about what human persons are, and what they are genuinely meant to live for (and not live for). The Christian intellectual tradition typically has argued that the human being has a unique dignity because he or she is made in the image of God, and has spiritual powers of intelligence and free will. The Thomistic tradition has argued that this truth claim is at least in part verifiable and defensible by means of philosophical argumentation. [See in this respect Madden (2013) and Stump (2005), noted below.] One can analyze and explain key facets of human reason and free decision making so as to show why human beings are agents of moral responsibility and more profoundly, why they are spiritual animals. They are constituted not only by bodies possessing (highly evolved) animal powers but also by a spiritual principle or \u201csoul\u201d that is the formal cause of personal identity. Does one have to go all the way into such metaphysical speculation to retain a rich conception of human justice? Some would say no. I agree with philosophers like Augustine, Aquinas, Hume and Nietzsche that it matters very much that we determine first what human beings are if we wish to in turn to evaluate their ethical nature.\n\nFrom this line of thinking of thinking about justice one also might suggest that the search for justice is integrally related to the search to love or care for others personally in responsibility, and the need of the community not only to punish or rehabilitate but also to forgive and have mercy. Mercy entails a love that passes beyond the mere requirement so justice, so as to care for a person when he or she is suffering i n extremis or failing ethically. Mercy helps us recall what inter-personal relations are about fundamentally, the communion of persons in love of friendship. Mercy can seek to reconstitute communion even after people have failed to attain the due measure of justice, even while acknowledging justice. In this sense there is no mercy without justice since mercy is more apparent when love passes beyond merely \u201cwhat is due\u201d to another. At the same time, justice without mercy readily becomes a caricature of itself, a kind of ethical false coinage. Just relations between persons exist in view of love of friendship, cooperation that is personal, and in view of a civilization of human charity. When one weaponizes justice in uncharitable ways so as to exclude or destroy persons and harden society abrasively, one creates an unmerciful and in effect unloving society. War does this, even just war, to some extent (though one may still commend one\u2019s enemies to the eschatological mercy of God). But it is an error to construe civic and political life as always being on war footing. The truth is that all human beings are unjust at times, even radically so, so in a society that loses a sense of mercy, justice will eventually become intolerable and so even a culture of justice will be difficult to sustain. The wielders of justice if they are not perfect, which they will not be, will appear arbitrary or inconsistent in their justice, so their notions of justice will become suspect. Those who want a culture of justice should strive also to create a culture of mercy, rehabilitation, and reasonable penance. Indeed, penance is important for the harmony of justice and mercy, so that confession, forgiveness and reconciliation can be a dimension of human social life.\n\nHistorically the cultural belief in the centrality and practice of mercy as a qualifying feature of justice is of Christian ancient and medieval origin, and there are noteworthy exponents of it who developed their ideas against the backdrop of a Christian eschatological and theo-centric vision of the human person and of society. We can think here of Augustine, Aquinas, Catherine of Siena, and in more recent times, Pope Leo XIII, Elizabeth Anscombe and Pope Francis. Christian intellectuals should think not only of human justice but also of the transcendent divine justice and mercy of God publicly revealed in Christ. The latter idea is not merely a private or individual truth, unless one holds to an erroneous conception of it. In the New Testament we are intriguingly told that God himself has justified humanity. That is to say, in the person of Christ, God has revealed a deeper mystery and order of justice unfolding in human history, in which God seeks to repair our ties of weak or self-interested love (individual or collective), to reestablish and reframe our human common life, by the power of his grace.\n\nChristians need not be reticent to speak about this mystery of divine love and justice, unveiled in Christ, in the university today. Historically speaking the very idea of Christian atonement (literally: at - one - ment) gave rise to the aspiration of a genuinely universal culture of learning and love of God and others, at the heart of the medieval university. In our contemporary academic context characterized by ideological heterogeneity and by an often contested search for new grounds of ethical normativity, this distinctively Christian notion of universal love and personalistic justice can provide a helpful resource in the ongoing shared human search for the truth.\n\nIs it really possible to speak about such matters with people who do not share a common assent to the central truth claims of Christianity? I think it certainly is at least in part. We might note some of the key claims made above that one could openly propose or discuss with colleagues not prone to share any particular convictions regarding God or Christianity.\n\nJustice may be considered broadly as the rendering to each what is due to him or her, but this is in fact analogically denoted, as we have noted above, in diverse ways. One cannot apply notions of distributive justice to situations that entail the norms of commutative justice, or participatory justice. Justice within the family can be analyzed using either of these three forms of justice, depending on the relations in question, but what justice is in the family is different from what it is in the university or work place, the city, the state, the nation or the international order. Distinct common goods entail distinct relations and forms of responsibility.\n\nThis means that the determination of what justice is is not merely a question of intuition or emotivism (though our intuitions or emotions may or may not tell us something about it, imperfectly). Thinking about justice is an intellectual discipline marked by care for truthfulness, analytic depth, clarity of analysis and fairness as well as the search for concord, love and appreciation of persons. One can invite non-Christians to this vision of things.\n\nIt is mysterious that we as human animals are subjects able to be just who are characterized by responsibility. What does this say about us as beings, open in freedom to do what truth requires, but also able to evade or ignore the truth in our actions? To converse about justice is to ask in reality what a human being is, a fact that Plato already saw so well in the Gorgias. The travails of modern university culture in regard to this question are new opportunities to return to the sources of classical reflection on his key question. What is a person?\n\nWhat about justice within the larger complex dynamic of human existence, marked by moral failure (sin), evil, the need for repentance, forgiveness, and rehabilitation? Anyone who sustains meaningful human relationships knows he or she needs some form of forgiveness to play a life-giving role in their relations to others. What does this unavoidable drama of human good and evil say to us and to our contemporaries? Does our experience of ethical fragility (and for some at times even torment) open us up to religious questions, or should it? Here again we face a perennial question. To ask about justice is also to ask ultimately who in this universe is on trial by whom? Is the court of history constituted merely by passing human beings, who judge us in the hours before they in turn die, and leave the standards to others that may change them? Or are we ultimately on trial before a transcendent standard, the mystery of God in his truth and justice? In this latter case, would the trial, execution and death of Christ have something to tell us about our relationship to God and one another? Is it a piece of romantic lore or is it Logos made flesh, divine reason unveiled in human history? We might also courageously invite our secular colleagues in the university today to ask this question of Christ himself, doubtful or agnostic though they may be. After all, he can and often will answer them directly, since he is now risen from the dead. We crucified him, but on the other shore of our injustice, he provides an unyielding horizon of hope, bearing in on us, inviting us to a new and strange regime of justice, mercy, and charity.\n\nJ.

    "bodyHtml": "<p>Prof. Wolterstorff helpfully points out that justice is based on healthy and well-ordered relationships between persons. For Thomas Aquinas, the medieval theologian influenced by Aristotle and Augustine, such order emerges from natural human inclinations to seek happiness in virtuous and constructive ways, through relationships of affability and love of friendship, within the framework of collective lives based around goods shared in common. [See <i>Summa Theologiae </i>II-II, qq. 58, 61] A human family, for example, is a kind of common good in which each person can flourish through affable and caring relationships, friendships of the spouses and parental friendships with children in their care. Based on such relations, an order of justice emerges. Parents, for example, normally owe certain standards of care and education to their children. Spouses normally owe one another a certain degree of engagement and genuine fidelity. The relationships between persons in this context amount to more than relationships of justice but they include and are supported by fundamental relations of justice.

Indeed, penance is important for the harmony of justice and mercy, so that confession, forgiveness and reconciliation can be a dimension of human social life.</p>\n<p>Historically the cultural belief in the centrality and practice of mercy as a qualifying feature of justice is of Christian ancient and medieval origin, and there are noteworthy exponents of it who developed their ideas against the backdrop of a Christian eschatological and theo-centric vision of the human person and of society. We can think here of Augustine, Aquinas, Catherine of Siena, and in more recent times, Pope Leo XIII, Elizabeth Anscombe and Pope Francis. Christian intellectuals should think not only of human justice but also of the transcendent divine justice and mercy of God publicly revealed in Christ. The latter idea is not merely a private or individual truth, unless one holds to an erroneous conception of it. In the New Testament we are intriguingly told that God himself has justified humanity. That is to say, in the person of Christ, God has revealed a deeper mystery and order of justice unfolding in human history, in which God seeks to repair our ties of weak or self-interested love (individual or collective), to reestablish and reframe our human common life, by the power of his grace.</p>\n<p>Christians need not be reticent to speak about this mystery of divine love and justice, unveiled in Christ, in the university today. Historically speaking the very idea of Christian atonement (literally: at - one - ment) gave rise to the aspiration of a genuinely universal culture of learning and love of God and others, at the heart of the medieval university. In our contemporary academic context characterized by ideological heterogeneity and by an often contested search for new grounds of ethical normativity, this distinctively Christian notion of universal love and personalistic justice can provide a helpful resource in the ongoing shared human search for the truth.</p>\n<h2>Speaking Justice to the Whole Academy</h2>\n<p>Is it really possible to speak about such matters with people who do not share a common assent to the central truth claims of Christianity? I think it certainly is at least in part. We might note some of the key claims made above that one could openly propose or discuss with colleagues not prone to share any particular convictions regarding God or Christianity.</p>\n<p>Justice may be considered broadly as the rendering to each what is due to him or her, but this is in fact analogically denoted, as we have noted above, in diverse ways. One cannot apply notions of distributive justice to situations that entail the norms of commutative justice, or participatory justice. Justice within the family can be analyzed using either of these three forms of justice, depending on the relations in question, but what justice is in the family is different from what it is in the university or work place, the city, the state, the nation or the international order. <i>Distinct common goods entail distinct relations and forms of responsibility. </i></p>\n<p>This means that the determination of what justice is is not merely a question of intuition or emotivism (though our intuitions or emotions may or may not tell us something about it, imperfectly). <i>Thinking about justice is an intellectual discipline</i> marked by care for truthfulness, analytic depth, clarity of analysis and fairness as well as the search for concord, love and appreciation of persons. One can invite non-Christians to this vision of things.</p>\n<p>It is mysterious that we as human animals are subjects able to be just who are characterized by responsibility. What does this say about us as beings, open in freedom to do what truth requires, but also able to evade or ignore the truth in our actions? To converse about justice is to ask in reality what a human being is, a fact that Plato already saw so well in the Gorgias. <i>The travails of modern university culture in regard to this question are new opportunities to return to the sources of classical reflection on his key question. What is a person? </i></p>\n<p>What about justice within the larger complex dynamic of human existence, marked by moral failure (sin), evil, the need for repentance, forgiveness, and rehabilitation? Anyone who sustains meaningful human relationships knows he or she needs some form of forgiveness to play a life-giving role in their relations to others. What does this unavoidable drama of human good and evil say to us and to our contemporaries? Does our experience of ethical fragility (and for some at times even torment) open us up to religious questions, or should it? Here again we face a perennial question. To ask about justice is also to ask ultimately who in this universe is on trial by whom? Is the court of history constituted merely by passing human beings, who judge us in the hours before they in turn die, and leave the standards to others that may change them? Or are we ultimately on trial before a transcendent standard, the mystery of God in his truth and justice? In this latter case, would the trial, execution and death of Christ have something to tell us about our relationship to God and one another? Is it a piece of romantic lore or is it Logos made flesh, divine reason unveiled in human history? We might also courageously invite our secular colleagues in the university today to ask this question of Christ himself, doubtful or agnostic though they may be. After all, he can and often will answer them directly, since he is now risen from the dead. We crucified him, but on the other shore of our injustice, <i>he provides an unyielding horizon of hope, bearing in on us, inviting us to a new and strange regime of justice, mercy, and charity. </i></p>\n<h2 class=\"new_page\">Further Reading</h2>\n<p>J.

I understand interdisciplinary research as a practice that, without denying the individual identity of the disciplines involved, results in the production of innovative knowledge with insights from different fields. In interdisciplinary research, experts from diverse disciplines work in a joint, not independent, manner on a common problem, engaging in a creative pluralism that requires them to share the way of thinking of others, and not only to learn new content from different fields.\n\nNevertheless, interdisciplinary research faces a series of challenges related, mainly, to the interaction between specialists and the reciprocal evaluation of their different points of view. In particular, collaborations between philosophy/theology and sciences are challenging because each researcher is used to working within the framework of a theoretical doctrine and following their own methods and procedures. Therefore, the lack of knowledge of many empirical details challenges the philosophers, while the sophistication of the underlying philosophical discussions challenges the scientists. Furthermore, since many terms change their meaning depending on the disciplinary context, the problem of communicating correctly challenges everyone. As interdisciplinary research involves a greater effort than that required by an exclusively disciplinary approach, the willingness of the researchers is necessary to carry the investigation through to the end.\n\nConsequently, interdisciplinary research demands a very particular and deep type of interaction between academics. Collaborative intellectual work requires a mutual appreciation and respect among the members of the research team to promote among them an attitude of openness that consolidates the desire to learn from others. These attitudes can only be developed in a climate of trust.\n\nFirst-order justice is a founding pillar of trust. When there has been a violation of first-order justice, trust between people is broken. Although second-order justice is a fair way of responding to that violation, second-order justice hardly restores trust. Since a climate of trust is essential in collaborative teams, and since situations of injustice among team members could alter this climate, transparent relationships of fairness and justice among investigators should be a concern when conducting collaborative research.\n\nThe first step in developing trust among members of the research team is a fair recognition of the contributions of others, since both empirical developments and bibliographic studies or conceptual analyzes all contribute equally to clarify the object of study in an interdisciplinary research. The next step could be achieved through the concerted effort to produce a joint publication. Publishing the results in co-authored articles is a deeper manifestation of trust and mutual recognition among researchers. However, as the practice of co-authorship does not follow the same rules in all disciplines, a fair authorship policy must be established. Another important aspect is transparency and equity in the management of research funding, because an unbiased distribution of the resources obtained also consolidates the trust of the researchers. In this sense, a climate of deep trust among interdisciplinary researchers could only be achieved to the extent that all of them are open to learn from each other and are firmly committed to the effort of understanding and respecting the characteristics of those epistemic fields in which they are not specialists.\n\nVanney, Claudia E. 2021. \"Virtudes intelectuales para la investigaci\u00f3n en ciencia y filosof\u00eda.\" In Ciencia y filosof\u00eda.

Although second-order justice is a fair way of responding to that violation, second-order justice hardly restores trust. Since a climate of trust is essential in collaborative teams, and since situations of injustice among team members could alter this climate, transparent relationships of fairness and justice among investigators should be a concern when conducting collaborative research.</p>\n<p>The first step in developing trust among members of the research team is a fair recognition of the contributions of others, since both empirical developments and bibliographic studies or conceptual analyzes all contribute equally to clarify the object of study in an interdisciplinary research. The next step could be achieved through the concerted effort to produce a joint publication. Publishing the results in co-authored articles is a deeper manifestation of trust and mutual recognition among researchers. However, as the practice of co-authorship does not follow the same rules in all disciplines, a fair authorship policy must be established. Another important aspect is transparency and equity in the management of research funding, because an unbiased distribution of the resources obtained also consolidates the trust of the researchers. In this sense, a climate of deep trust among interdisciplinary researchers could only be achieved to the extent that all of them are open to learn from each other and are firmly committed to the effort of understanding and respecting the characteristics of those epistemic fields in which they are not specialists.</p>\n<h2 class=\"new_page\">Further Reading</h2>\n<p>Vanney, Claudia E. 2021. \"Virtudes intelectuales para la investigaci\u00f3n en ciencia y filosof\u00eda.\" In <i>Ciencia y filosof\u00eda. </i><i>Estudios en homenaje a Juan Arana</i>, edited by Francisco Rodr\u00edguez Valls and Juan Jos\u00e9 Padial.

We live in a liberal society where everything is permitted unless specifically prohibited. But Scripture tells us that we are fallen creatures. Lawmaking, therefore, must play a critical role in shaping second-order justice, in Wolterstorff\u2019s terms, and it is important to ensure that our government makes laws that are just and righteous, as we strive toward first-order justice.\n\nOne area of my research is looking into the mechanisms of administrative rulemaking. Administrative rulemaking is the process by which government agencies adopt rules that have the force of law. In the U.S. we typically think of lawmaking as an act of Congress, carried out by elected officials in their representative capacity. But in today\u2019s administrative state in the U.S., and in many other democratic societies and advanced economies, many rules that have far-reaching economic and social impacts\u2014including efficiency and distributive consequences\u2014are adopted at the agency level by appointed officials or civil servants. This is considered constitutional as long as each agency acts within its lawfully delegated authority from Congress.\n\nThe basic rulemaking process in the U.S. is governed by the Administrative Procedure Act of 1946. The most common process includes (i) an agency\u2019s issuance of a notice of proposed rulemaking, (ii) a 30-day period during which the general public can submit comments and views on the proposed rule, and (iii) the agency\u2019s adoption of the final rule after giving a careful consideration of the submitted comments and views. Once a rule is adopted, those citizens or interest groups who desire to challenge the rule can seek judicial review and have the court examine whether the agency followed a proper procedure and acted within its statutory authority in adopting the rule.\n\nThe traditional basis for government regulation is a market failure. In economic terms, a market failure is a situation in which the allocation of goods and services by an unregulated market fails to achieve efficiency. Typical examples include natural monopoly, public goods, information asymmetry, and externalities. For economists, the main problem with a market failure is that society is leaving money on the table, and valuable resources or opportunities are being wasted due to transaction costs.\n\nUnder Wolterstorff\u2019s framework, however, a market failure can also be seen as hindering first-order justice in the economy. Market participants often fail to practice first-order justice because their incentives are misaligned or because they lack information. As a result, agency rules that can effectively address market failures, coupled with enforcement actions, can help, guide, or compel individuals and institutions to render to others what is due to them. Accordingly, improving the government\u2019s process of administrative rulemaking can lead to a better administration of second-order justice and render greater first-order justice in our economy.\n\nMy research agenda seeks to broadly identify innovative mechanisms by which we can promote more transparent, empirically-informed, and fair rulemaking in a world where agencies often have to operate on the basis of less than perfect information. Innovation is necessary in this area because, in practice, there are a number of ways in which administrative rulemaking may be misguided.\n\nFirst, a well-intentioned agency head can design and adopt a rule based on incomplete or biased information. In such instances, an agency may have correctly identified the relevant market failure, but it may end up adopting a rule that comes short of addressing it appropriately.\n\nSecond, a well-intentioned agency head can face opposition by powerful and well-funded interest groups that may have their own agenda. Those groups can seek judicial review of an agency\u2019s rule once it is adopted. In some instances, an agency can lose the legal challenge and the reviewing court may vacate what could have been an efficient rule. This can happen, for example, if the court finds that the agency did not sufficiently analyze the rule\u2019s benefits and its costs on the economy.\n\nThird, an agency head herself may strive to adopt a rule that will have a very particular political outcome. In so doing, she may turn a blind eye to how the rule may bring about other consequences. In such instances, a rule adopted by the agency can have a mix of good and bad effects. It may also come with significant distribution concerns. In all these instances, second-order justice is thwarted, and unfair outcomes may result.\n\nMy special interest lies at the intersection of securities regulation (a body of law that regulates the market for capital) and administrative law (a body of law that regulates the administration of government agencies). Between 2007 and 2012, I had the privilege of working at the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC). The SEC is a federal government agency whose mission is to protect investors, maintain fair, orderly, and efficient markets, and facilitate capital formation. The agency routinely adopts corporate disclosure rules to provide greater transparency for investors and brings enforcement actions against those who violate the law.\n\nDuring my first three years at the agency, I was an Economic Fellow and helped the Commission analyze the costs and benefits of various rules the agency sought to adopt. One challenge facing a regulatory agency, such as the SEC, is that it must at times adopt a rule to address a clear market failure, but without a large amount of relevant data. Without data, quantifying benefits and costs will be nearly impossible and the agency will have to resort to qualitative reasoning to justify its rule. During the last two years, I worked as an attorney advisor in the Division of Economic and Risk Analysis and worked closely with the Office of the General Counsel when the Commission had to defend its rules from legal challenges by various petitioners who argued that the agency\u2019s economic analysis was faulty or otherwise insufficient.\n\nThroughout my time at the SEC, I was preoccupied with the administrative rulemaking process. The basic process posed two difficulties. First, it was easy for powerful interest groups, intent on opposing a proposed rule, to hijack the process by submitting voluminous technical comments with a vast lot of information that may be one-sided. Second, there was insufficient transparency in the way the agency staff or the commenters communicated their own reservations, uncertainties, or risks about a rule. I began thinking about ways to make modest and implementable reforms to address these difficulties--including ex post and ex ante mechanisms to bring more data to the process and analytical frameworks for considering the economic and distributive effects of a rule in a more comprehensive manner.\n\nEventually, I joined legal academia with the hope that my research in this area could contribute to promoting more transparent and productive regulatory dialogues in rulemaking and lead to agency rules that are both efficient and effective. There is much work to be done in this area. In an increasingly complex world, challenges to designing an optimal rule will be formidable.

My starting point is the observation that dignity has been deployed by judges, in jurisdictions from America to Zimbabwe, to do both expressive work (e.g. as a normatively powerful value which is useful for condemning the multiplicity of rape\u2019s harms) and doctrinal work (e.g. to ground arguments about how the doctrines of rape law should evolve) in relation to the criminalization of sexual violence. As Professor Wolterstorff notes, dignity has achieved the status of an assumed norm in international human rights. Christopher McCrudden (2008) has mapped the emergence of human dignity as the hallmark of international human rights law since the second half of the twentieth century, in resilement from the horrors of the Second World War. The atrocities committed in that war by their nature denied the inherent, equal excellence and worth of various people groups. \u201cDignity\u201d as a political and legal value affirms the equal, inalienable worth of all people (McCrudden refers to this as dignity\u2019s \u201contological claim\u201d) and resulting \u201crelational claims\u201d as to how people can and cannot be treated.\n\n\u201cDignity talk\u201d is now prevalent in law, not only in jurisdictions like German, Israel and South Africa which have enacted dignity as a constitutional norm of the highest order; but also in jurisdictions the constitutions of which make no direct reference to dignity. For example, in the United States, some of the Supreme Court\u2019s most seminal decisions\u2014relating to abortion, same-sex marriage, capital punishment\u2014turn on dignity.\n\nIn my work, I trace the permeation of dignity talk into the legal sub-discipline of sexual violence. My work is \u201cbottom up\u201d, in that I seek to understand how and why judges use dignity in caselaw. To establish a framework for that analysis, I first map the broad contours of a feminist understanding of \u201csexual dignity\u201d in sexual violence theory; in that body of work, it is possible to identify an emerging consensus on the meaning of dignity as a thick, multidimensional concept, capacious enough to express the multiplicity of rape\u2019s wrongs. That feminist theory of sexual dignity is then applied to review the use of dignity in sexual violence caselaw from multiple jurisdictions.\n\nOne key point I explore is the distinction made by Jean Hampton between diminishment of dignity and degradation. Hampton is cited by Wolterstorff as explicating quite clearly the wrongfulness of dignity-defying acts: \u201cA person wrongs another, treats them as they have a right not to be treated, \u2018if and only if (while acting as a responsible agent) she treats him in a way that is objectively \u2026 demeaning, that is disrespectful of [that person\u2019s] worth\u2019\u201d. Importantly, Hampton has elsewhere argued that there is an important distinction between \u201cdiminishment (the mere portrayal of someone as lower) and degradation (the actual lowering of a person\u2019s value)\u201d (Hampton 1999, 138). The distinction is important, argues Hampton, because\n\n[w]e need a way of understanding when sex can be wrong, even while holding to the idea that its wrongfulness is never something that can lessen a woman\u2019s worth as a person, no matter what her society (or her psychologists) might tell her (or do to her) in the aftermath of the experience. The point of distinguishing between diminishment \u2026 and degradation \u2026, then linking wrongdoing only with diminishment, is that we are able to affirm that the value of the victim always persists after the crime.\n\nDiminishment may be subjectively experienced as degradation; indeed, rape is \u201ca kind of event that seeks to make that diminished status a reality. The woman is used as though she is an object, and so she is thought to be one\u201d (Hampton 1999, 135). But importantly, dignity as it is understood in secular Western law and philosophy is assumed to be permanent, a point that the diminishment/degradation highlights well.\n\nFor Christians a sacred conception of dignity premised on imago Dei is even more fundamentally understood as inalienable and permanent. Because our dignity derives from being made in God\u2019s image, it cannot be taken away, even by the most harmful of acts. It can only be denied. This can, of course, be subjectively experienced by the rape victim as an actual degradation of selfhood or the \u201ccessation of selfhood\u201d (West 1999, 109); but her dignity-bearing self, her imago Dei self, endures.\n\nProfessor Wolterstorff\u2019s Brief centres justice in dignity. This Note has elaborated by highlighting one way in which a feminist understanding of sexual dignity \u2013 a key concept underpinning the criminal justice response to sexual violence \u2013 resonates with a Christian understanding of the imago Dei -derived dignity of all humankind as permanent and inalienable. Human dignity may be denied but it cannot be extinguished.\n\nHampton, Jean.

Wolterstorff rejects the term \u201cdistributive justice\u201d for the type of justice which consists of agents acting justly in their ordinary affairs. However, although such justice can often be seen in terms of ways benefits and/or burdens are distributed, that is not always the case. Consider rape, which Wolterstorff characterizes as \u201ca profound violation of justice, a profound wrong. But what fundamentally makes it wrong is not that benefits and burdens have been mal-distributed \u2013 though they have been.

The distinction is important, argues Hampton, because</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>[w]e need a way of understanding when sex can be wrong, even while holding to the idea that its wrongfulness is never something that can lessen a woman\u2019s worth as a person, no matter what her society (or her psychologists) might tell her (or do to her) in the aftermath of the experience. The point of distinguishing between diminishment \u2026 and degradation \u2026, then linking wrongdoing only with diminishment, is that we are able to affirm that the value of the victim always persists after the crime.</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>[w]e need a way of understanding when sex can be wrong, even while holding to the idea that its wrongfulness is never something that can lessen a woman\u2019s worth as a person, no matter what her society (or her psychologists) might tell her (or do to her) in the aftermath of the experience. The point of distinguishing between diminishment \u2026 and degradation \u2026, then linking wrongdoing only with diminishment, is that we are able to affirm that the value of the victim always persists after the crime.</p>\n<p>Diminishment may be subjectively experienced as degradation; indeed, rape is \u201ca kind of event that seeks to make that diminished status a reality. The woman is used as though she is an object, and so she is thought to be one\u201d (Hampton 1999, 135). But importantly, dignity as it is understood in secular Western law and philosophy is assumed to be permanent, a point that the diminishment/degradation highlights well.</p>\n<p>For Christians a sacred conception of dignity premised on <i>imago Dei</i> is even more fundamentally understood as inalienable and permanent. Because our dignity derives from being made in God\u2019s image, it cannot be taken away, even by the most harmful of acts. It can only be denied. This can, of course, be subjectively experienced by the rape victim as an actual degradation of selfhood or the \u201ccessation of selfhood\u201d (West 1999, 109); but her dignity-bearing self, her <i>imago Dei</i> self, endures.</p>\n<p>Professor Wolterstorff\u2019s Brief centres justice in dignity. This Note has elaborated by highlighting one way in which a feminist understanding of sexual dignity \u2013 a key concept underpinning the criminal justice response to sexual violence \u2013 resonates with a Christian understanding of the <i>imago Dei</i>-derived dignity of all humankind as permanent and inalienable. Human dignity may be denied but it cannot be extinguished.</p>\n<h2 class=\"new_page\">References</h2>\n<p>Hampton, Jean. <i>Defining Wrong and Defining Rape, in</i> A Most Detestable Crime: New Philosophical Essays on Rape 135 (Keith Burgess-Jackson ed., 1999), using the concepts of diminishment and degradation to understand morally wrongful sex.</p>\n<p>High, Anna. <i>Sexual Dignity in Rape Law, </i>__ Yale J.

When it comes to achieving our human purpose, the consequence is that, though we propel the wheel of our existence faster and faster, we end up making no progress at all.\n\nThe assumption of this brief is that \u201ca flourishing life\u201d is a normative ideal. Consequently, setting the definition of flourishing cannot be a task for the empirical sciences . What follows is our proposal, as Christian theologians, of how best to frame the theological and philosophical reflection required to ground our research into\u2014and pursuit of\u2014flourishing life.\n\nA Three-Part Conception of Flourishing\n\nOur proposal is an expansion of Nicholas Wolterstorff\u2019s argument in Justice: Rights and Wrongs : we flourish when, in addition to leading life well (agency) and life going well (circumstances), life also feels right to us (emotions).\n\nLife led well refers to the \u201cagential\u201d dimension of the flourishing life, to the good conduct of life \u2014 from right thoughts and right acts to right habits and right virtues.\n\nLife going well refers to the \u201ccircumstantial\u201d dimension of the flourishing life, to the desirable circumstances of life \u2014 be they natural (like fertile, uncontaminated land), social (like friendships or the absence of war), or personal (like certain kinds of genes or a well-functioning body).\n\nLife feeling as it should is about the \u201cemotional\u201d dimension of the flourishing life, about \u201chappiness\u201d (or contentment or joy), empathy, and the like.\n\nThe flourishing life thereby has three dimensions: agential (or active), circumstantial (or passive), and emotional (combining both passivity and agency). Alternative accounts of flourishing life differ in two major ways: (1) how they understand each dimension of flourishing life and (2) how much weight they place on each.\n\nThree Thinkers on Flourishing\n\nWe illustrate each of the three aspects by considering thinkers who have placed just one of them at the center of their visions of flourishing.\n\nFor the ancient Stoics, people like the emperor Marcus Aurelius, flourishing, or the good and true life, is preponderantly one of virtuous agency , not of positive feeling (which, in a strictly limited form, flows out of virtuous agency) or adequate external goods (which, strictly speaking, are irrelevant).\n\nFor Karl Marx flourishing is understood primarily as life going well . The revolution will bring about the transformation of technological, economic, and political circumstances, by historical processes, and is sufficient for the flourishing of all; \u201cmoral\u201d behavior and appropriate affective states will follow.\n\nFor Mustapha Mond, a fictional character from Aldous Huxley\u2019s dystopia Brave New World , flourishing can be understood as life feeling right . In Mond one can recognize a realization of the vision of the utilitarian Jeremy Bentham, who begins An Introduction to the Principles of Morals and Legislation (1789) with the statement: \u201cNature has placed mankind under the governance of two sovereign masters, pain and pleasure. They alone point out what we ought to do and determine what we shall do.\u201d\n\nMarcus, Marx, and Mond are each exemplars of flourishing: agency in Stoicism, circumstances in Marxism, and emotions in Utilitarianism.\n\nA Christian Vision\n\nA plausible Christian way of construing the vision of flourishing life is to see it summed up in the statement of the Apostle Paul that the kingdom of God consists in \u201crighteousness and peace and joy in the Holy Spirit\u201d (Romans 14:17). Righteousness here means a certain kind of agency , the right living which is summed up in love of God and neighbor; peace means a certain kind of circumstances , a comprehensive order of material and relational well-being; joy is the signature emotion of the flourishing life where one responds with positive feeling to both right agency and right circumstances. As is suggested by the order in which Paul lists the three, righteousness as the agential aspect of flourishing life, has primacy without in any way devaluing the other two.\n\nThe three dimensions of flourishing life are not just each important in its own right, but each at the same time in part contains the others so that each dimension, though distinct, can serve as a window onto the whole of the flourishing life. Love, for instance, is a certain kind of agency (beneficence), but it is at the same time circumstance (world of love) and a feeling (attachment). A different way to make the same point would be to say that each needs the others to be fully itself. Finally, all three of these are not possessions of independently self-actualized human beings, but rather markers of a life flourishing in relationship to the Divine; each and all three together are, as Rom. 14:17 insists, only fully ours \u201c in the Holy Spirit .\u201d\n\n10 November 2020\n\n[\u00a01\u00a0] Miroslav Volf, \u201cLife Worth Living: Christian Faith and the Crisis of Universities,\u201d https://www.abc.net.au/religion/life-worth-living-christian-faith-and-the-crisis-of-the-universi/10099272 .\n\n[\u00a02\u00a0] For the phrases and the image of the painter, see Hartmut Rosa, Resonance: A Sociology of Our Relationship to the World , trans.

Human agency \u2013 most efficaciously the good habits we call virtues , both moral and intellectual \u2013 is arguably the feature of human flourishing most common to persons qua persons; but the circumstances of our flourishing (in themselves necessary because of the space-time character of human existence) vary greatly, both with respect to the particulars given us throughout our lives and as subject matter and project for every person\u2019s unique vocation. (My own vocation as a professor of architecture and urban design is clearly oriented to the circumstances of human flourishing, the agential pursuit of which my character virtues or lack thereof either advance or retard.)\n\nThe Preview also, as others have noted, tends to be individualistic in its account of human flourishing. What does it mean for communities to flourish, and how does communal flourishing relate to individual flourishing either in secular life or in the Church (cf. 1 Corinthians 12)? What does it mean to be flourishing as a fetus, infant, child, adolescent, or in old age \u2013 existential conditions in which flourishing is arguably most contingent upon circumstance \u2013 or as a young adult, spouse, or parent growing into full caring agency for children, elderly parents, one another, and one\u2019s work? I would hope to see as well a treatment of sin, differences of temperament, and the ways in which God\u2019s love for us is manifested in both our pleasure and our suffering.\n\nI see these issues as related to the Preview\u2019s assessment of feelings , which after the triumph of the therapeutic perhaps should not merit quite so central and objectively important a role in individual and collective human flourishing as agency and circumstance . Feelings are considered initially in a utilitarian calculus of pain and pleasure, both rightly regarded as insufficient measures of human flourishing. But if, as the Preview suggests, joy is the privileged sacramental and eschatological emotion, for those in daily life not temperamentally disposed toward joy -- can we imagine, say, Evelyn Waugh, or even St. Jerome, both of whom one hopes were being faithful to their respective vocations, being habitually joyful prior to the beatific vision? -- it seems an unnecessary burden to designate joy as the emotional signifier of quotidian human flourishing. To be sure, pleasure in God\u2019s creation, in human friendship and love, in whatever is true, good, or beautiful \u2013 ultimately, pleasure in \u201cthe sweet \u2018well done\u2019 in judgment hour\u201d -- is no small component of human flourishing. But these are all instances of taking pleasure in things that are objectively good. Rather than zeroing in on one or a few specific emotions that Christians should be feeling, would it not be more accurate to say that flourishing requires not a disregard of feeling (including sometimes, for example, feelings of revulsion), but rather an education in how to feel in ways appropriate to the objective requirements of human agency (vocation), circumstance, and divine providence? Perhaps also to say that to be flourishing in a present sense is to be on the road to an end of more comprehensive knowledge; of personal sanctity in communion with God, neighbor, and a transfigured and sanctified creation [\u2018a new heaven and a new earth\u2019]; to our fullest recognition of the beauty of both God and creation; and this in the privileged specificity of our own unique vocation , whether more pleasurable or less, whether entailing less suffering or more?\n\nFinally, almost a coda : I approach the issue of human flourishing as a Christian and as an urbanist, the latter from an Aristotelian presumption that the telos of the state \u2013 even today, as for Aristotle, at the scale of the city (correctly understood as an agrarian-urban unit) \u2013 is the well-being of its citizens over the course of a whole lifetime (as it is for the Church, but over the course of a lifetime and into eternity). Christian theology perfects Aristotelian eudaimonia \u2013 happiness; blessedness; flourishing -- in a variety of particulars, e.g., with a more expansive view of human being; by introducing the idea of shalom and its recognition of a necessary transcendent dimension to human flourishing; and by noting the necessity for human flourishing of the infused theological virtues of faith, hope, and charity. But this completion does not negate the essential philosophical structural soundness of the Aristotelian idea succinctly summarized in Politics VII.1 : \u201cthe best life, for both individuals and for states [ \u03c0\u03cc\u03bb\u03b5\u03b9\u03c2] is the life of virtue [moral and intellectual], when virtue has external goods enough for the performance of good actions. \u201d Such a life necessarily entails living in a variety of communities with others \u2013 and for most human beings in a city , understood as an agrarian-urban unit which in today\u2019s world can range in scale from a solitary village to a metropolis of towns and city neighborhoods, but always a community of communities the telos of which is the flourishing of its members.\n\nWhat might such an urbanism look / be like in the modern world? In addition to the specific Chicago 2109 project referenced above [ https://afterburnham.com/ ] I have proposed more generally in chapter XI of Till We Have Built Jerusalem, \u201cThe Polis and Natural Law,\u201d a derived natural law precept about urban environments: human beings should make walkable mixed-use settlements. Many things follow from this precept, but one consequence of making land-use positive law \u2013 e.g. zoning law, property tax law -- in accordance with this natural law precept would be human settlements less like contemporary automobile suburbs, and more like the small town and big city neighborhoods that existed in a variety of locally specific forms virtually everywhere in the world prior to 1950.\n\nBut this would require us to become experts in the ends of city-making, with corresponding adjustments in the means by which we make them.",

The Taita\u2019s (shaman) grandchildren, 7 and 4 years old, were mourning the absence of their mother, who had to go away for a treatment. Instead of grief, they seemed only capable of love and joy. Love and joy sprang so spontaneously from them, as life itself nursing and nourishing each tree and animal around their home. The three dimensions of a flourishing life proposed by the authors of the brief (agential, circumstantial and emotional) were not only integrated in them, but their borders dissolved in those children\u2019s spontaneity. Certainly, they will have to grow up physically, psychologically and spiritually, and growth requires the conscious effort necessary for educating oneself in a right way of thinking and acting. But at that very moment there was no dichotomy between an active and a passive dimension of a fully human life, which, just as Angelus Silesius\u2019s rose, \u201cis without why, it blooms because it blooms\u201d.</span></span></span></span></span></p>\n<p><span><span><span><span><span>Maybe only in deep suffering are we able to experience such a degree of surrender and emptiness as to rediscover that, as the authors of the brief say, a flourishing life is not a possession or an achievement of an independent self (of the modern, autonomous, buffered self, to use Charles Taylor\u2019s designation), but rather the gift of a life spent in relationship to the Divine.

It is much harder to understand human flourishing in a system where the rule of law is weak, constitutional texts are disregarded, laws delays are excessive, and corruption is rampant.

With regard to the means, questions such as, \"How can we effectively promote forgiveness in practice?\" or \"What shapes and promotes the experience of love in childhood?\" seem of tremendous relevance to the Christian faith, and are amenable to, and have been subject to, considerable insightful empirical investigation (VanderWeele, 2018; Chen and VanderWeele, 2019). However, I think a more profound and far more difficult question is how the empirical sciences can and should contribute to our understanding of what constitutes flourishing. I agree that the empirical sciences are not to set the definition, but I do think they have a role in understanding the content of that definition. One might, for example, include physical health within a conception of flourishing (the \"circumstantial\" dimension), but the question of what constitutes bodily health is a matter not only of conceptual specification but of understanding anatomy and physiology. Similarly, good social relationships are also a part of human flourishing, but it is difficult to describe what constitutes such good social relationships without having an (empirical) understanding of how human life is actually lived in its embodied and culturally specific forms. From a Christian standpoint one would point to loving relationships and all that that entails (1 Corinthians 13:4-7) but what this means within a marriage, or while parenting, or within friendship, cannot be fully understood or appreciated without an experiential and empirical knowledge of how these types of relationships play out and what is required of each. The empirical sciences thus do seem to have some role, perhaps not in the definition of flourishing, but in our understanding of the actual content of that definition, i.e. the definition as it pertains to actual human life. The empirical sciences might not at present be particularly well constituted to provide this important service to theology, but it seems that some of the work of trying to redeem our academic structures and disciplines is to try to shape them so that they are better able to fulfill that role.\n\n(2) There is of course an important role for theology in trying to as fully and adequately as possible specify and describe how human flourishing ought to be understood within the Church. However, it would seem that another important task is to try to find consensus with those from other religious, philosophical and cultural traditions that is as broad as possible (in extent) and as expansive as possible (in content) and that is consistent with and arises out of a Christian vision so as to resist reductionist impulses to restrict notions of well-being to only economic and health-related states, as is the case in most discussion of this topic, at least in the contemporary west. Such more expansive but consensus-based understanding and resistance of reductionist approaches is part of the vision within Maritain\u2019s Integral Humanism . It is some of what has motivated our work and approach to flourishing assessment, study, and promotion at the Human Flourishing Program at Harvard (VanderWeele, 2017).\n\n(3) I was somewhat surprised at the characterization that the \"circumstantial\" dimension (life\u00a0going well) was considered \"passive\" and that the \"emotional\" dimension (life feeling right) was considered \"both passive and active\". I would have thought that the emotional dimension was in fact the most passive (the \"passions\" being a response to the perception of circumstances and actions), and that the \"circumstantial\" was both active and passive. It seems odd to place relationships, or health (or, presumably, knowledge also fits in the circumstantial dimension) as being entirely passive. This may merit some reconsideration, though one could I think also argue that all three of the proposed dimensions have active and passive components, including \"righteousness\", as per the Scripture reference concerning Romans 14:17 in the brief.\n\nReferences:\n\nVanderWeele, T.J.

With regard to the means, questions such as, \"How can we effectively promote forgiveness in practice?\" or \"What shapes and promotes the experience of love in childhood?\" seem of tremendous relevance to the Christian faith, and are amenable to, and have been subject to, considerable insightful empirical investigation (VanderWeele, 2018; Chen and VanderWeele, 2019).<br/>\nHowever, I think a more profound and far more difficult question is how the empirical sciences can and should contribute to our understanding of what constitutes flourishing.

We exercise moral and creative freedom in a context that is given to us.\n\n\u201cHear, O Israel! The Lord is our God, the Lord is one!\u201d (Deuteronomy 6.4). According to biblical tradition, God is one: That is to say, first, there is one good God, unrivalled by any evil opponent; and second, this God is internally coherent or rational. That is to say, the created world reflects the coherence, the rationality, the beauty, the order of the Creator (Gen 1:3,7). Monotheists, including Christians, have dogmatic reasons for assuming that the world is basically and constantly ordered and so, in principle, intelligible by human minds or \u2018rational\u2019. There are truths about reality that can be grasped. This assumption is basic to the natural sciences and should be basic to all academic endeavour.\n\nThe order which the one God impresses on the created world is not merely physical, but value-laden. The biblical Creator is identical with the Redeemer of the Hebrews from slavery in Egypt, and is assumed to be benevolent, willing what is good.\n\nThe Good Accordingly, the creation narrative in the book of Genesis tells us, repeatedly, that what God created was \u2018good\u2019 (verses 4, 10, 12, 18, 21, 25, 31). What is good is the foundation of moral order, since morally right behaviour defends or promotes what is good while morally wrong behaviour damages it. What is good (or the Good) is what causes human beings to flourish. Its components (or \u2018goods\u2019) include such things as friendship with God, personal integrity, just relationships, the experience of beauty, and creativity. These goods are prior to the moral principles and rules of right conduct and generates them: right conduct promotes them; wrong conduct detracts from them.\n\nThe Moral The body of these principles and rules is the moral law. Monotheists, therefore, are led by the logical of their theology to believe in a created, given, natural, objective moral order. This order is objective in the sense that it precedes, frames, and endows with moral weight the subjective choices of human creatures. The framework consists primarily of basic goods and secondarily of moral law. (Together the goods and the moral law are often known in Christian, especially Roman Catholic tradition as the \u2018natural law\u2019. Among Protestants, however, \u2018created order\u2019 is the preferred name.) This is the created, natural law to which St Paul alludes, when he writes that \u201cGentiles who have not the [revealed] law [of Moses] do by nature what the law requires. They show that what the [Mosaic] law requires is written on their hearts\u201d (Romans 2.14-15a).\n\nOrder need not be at odds with freedom. In the material dimension , physical laws accommodate quantum randomness. In the aesthetic dimension , familiarity with natural patterns and conventional rules is required for successful improvisation. In the value dimension , the moral order does not stifle human freedom. On the contrary, it provides a given framework that endows free human choices with meaning. As the (Catholic) philosopher, Charles Taylor, has written: \u201cEven the sense that the significance of my life comes from its being chosen ... depends on the understanding that independent of my will there is something noble, courageous, and hence significant in giving shape to my own life.\u2026 Horizons are given\u201d [\u00a01\u00a0] . The application of those principles and rules to particular circumstances remains open for morally responsible human beings to perform by the free and creative use of their reason in making judgements.\n\nAccording to Thomas Hobbes (1588-1679), there is neither morality nor justice before humans enter into social contracts; there is only the drive for self-preservation and the war of each against all. This vision of the human condition is fundamentally amoral. In contrast, Christian monotheism posits that even where there is no social contract or positive law or where that law is ineffective\u2014say, in the case of a failed state\u2014the natural moral law remains. And where that commands the consciences of human beings, it has the power to constrain and guide. There is a higher, moral authority to which critics of positive law can appeal, and which can provide moral justification for the defiance of positive law. Thus, from Thomas Aquinas (1225-74) in the 13 th century and the Reformers in the 16th century, Christians have affirmed the possibility of morally justified rebellion.\n\nIt follows that, even where there are no contracts between different peoples\u2014where there is no international law\u2014moral law still obtains. Insofar as this law commands the consciences of national leaders, it introduces a measure of order to relations between states. However, Christian doctrine in the form of the concept of universal sin will incline Christians to be alert to the actual fallibility of the fallen human conscience as personal experience and reflection on history tends to confirm. Not every people does what it should; and often peoples do what they should not. Because conscience cannot be relied upon, effective international order requires the additional constraints of international law, whether in the soft form of a consensus of opinion, the harder form of custom, or the hardest form of treaty.\n\nThe existence of a given, created order\u2014be it physical or aesthetic or moral\u2014implies that academic endeavour is properly about the discovery of the truth of reality as given by God. Of course, academics are sinners, just like everyone else. Consequently, their pursuit of truth can be corrupted by insecurity and the lust to dominate. It can also be corrupted by selfish interests in maintaining economic, political, and social power, as Marxists and some postmodernists remind us. Christian academics, however, at once aware of their creaturely responsibility under God\u2019s created moral order and of their sinful failure to meet it, will be careful to cultivate the virtues of humility (regarding the limits of their own knowledge), docility (or the readiness to learn), patience (in discerning the truth), justice (to what other people say), and charity (toward unwelcome views). Above all, Christian academics will remember that an academic career is a vocation to discover the truth in cooperation with others, not an opportunity for the proud and intimidating assertion of the ego.\n\n[\u00a01\u00a0] Charles Taylor, The Ethics of Authenticity (Cambridge, Mass.: Harvard University Press, 1991), p. 39.",

    "bodyText": "This essay first observes the pejorative connotation of \u2018order\u2019 in contemporary Western culture, before proceeding to explain the Christian concept of created order and how it at once legitimates human orders and provides the ground on which to criticise them. The following topics are addressed: in what sense there is a hierarchy of being among creatures; how the intelligibility of objective order authorises rational exchange; how the created order of values generates natural moral law; how created order, qualified by salvation history, enables \u2018tense consensus\u2019; the Trinitarian implication of dynamic created order; the compatibility of created order and creative freedom; the relationship between moral law, social order, political order, and \u2018positive\u2019 law; moral law where political order is absent or unjust; moral law and international relations; and created order and the academic vocation.\n\nModern Western culture warms to freedom and shies away from order. Whereas \u2018freedom\u2019 connotes liberation, exhilaration, and vitality, \u2018order\u2019 connotes oppression, constraint, and sterility. The reasons for this cultural bias lie in historical experience. First of all, there was the long history of endeavour in England, Europe and America\u2014from the 13 th to the 20 th century\u2014to curb and overcome political orders perceived to be tyrannical. Then, more recently, after the Second World War, there was the youth revolt against stifling class prejudice, social convention, and, above all, traditional Christian sexual morality.\n\nDifferent histories, however, produce different biases. In China, for example, whose past is replete with periods of bloody anarchy, \u2018order\u2019 tends to mean political stability, the absence of the threat of arbitrary non-state violence, and the peaceful opportunity to plan and build a prosperous material life. By the same token, \u2018freedom\u2019 is disturbing and suspect. Confucian philosophy embodies this perspective in its high esteem for tradition and convention, and its subjection of the individual to the requirements of the community.\n\nChristianity\u2019s view of order is nuanced. On the one hand, the world is understood as the creation of a rational Creator. Therefore, it is intelligible: there are given structures, patterns and regularities\u2014orders\u2014that are objectively present for rational creatures like human beings to grasp. Among these are physical, biological, and social orders. But there is also one of values, which provides a framework for human choices and dignifies them with moral significance.\n\nOn the other hand, within this framework there remains scope for individuals to choose freely which values to concentrate their lives upon, and how to defend and promote them, under prevailing circumstances\u2014be they historical, cultural, political, economic, or environmental\u2014and according to personal talent and taste. Moreover, this divinely created order of values, and the moral principles and rules it generates, comprise the basis of criticism of all human social and political orders, subject as they are to sinful corruption and distortion. The Creator and his creatures\u2014 a fortiori , his sinful creatures\u2014are not identical and should not be confused. The divinely created order is one thing; human orders are another. The two are not the same and the latter cannot automatically claim the authority of the former. Judged in the light of divine order, any human order might be found morally wanting.\n\nIn the essay that follows I will identify and discuss the main features of \u2018order\u2019 that come into focus from a Christian theological perspective. Since I am a moral theologian, whose interests and training concentrate on the moral or ethical dimension of theology, I shall have more to say on the ethical dimensions of the topic than on others. Had I been a philosophical theologian, I might have spent more time discussing physical, logical, or mathematical order. Unavoidably, the treatment of the topic that I offer here is constrained by the limits of my competence, although I have sought to test those limits, so as to make what I write relevant to as many academic disciplines as possible. Besides, since the main concern of biblical and subsequent Christian tradition is the salvation of God\u2019s creatures\u2014especially, his human creatures\u2014from the ravages of sin, it is not inappropriate for a theological treatise to focus on human agency and on what we humans ought, and ought not, to do in response to the creative and redemptive action of God.\n\nGod\u2019s creation encompasses the whole world, not just the human part of it. According to the first creation story in the book of Genesis, all of creation was beheld as good\u2014as having value\u2014in the eyes of God. Since they have value in God\u2019s eyes\u2014and not merely human ones\u2014non-human creatures have a worth that is somewhat independent of human uses. Yet, the first creation story in the book of Genesis is quite clear that plants and animals exist, in important part, to provide sustenance for human beings: \u201c Then God said, \u2018I give you every seed-bearing plant on the face of the whole earth and every tree that has fruit with seed in it. They will be yours for food.\u00a0And to all the beasts of the earth and all the birds of the air and all the creatures that move on the ground\u2014everything that has the breath of life in it\u2014I give every green plant for food\u2019\u201d\u00a0(Genesis 1, 29-30 NIV).\n\nIn God\u2019s creation there is clearly a hierarchical order, at whose apex human beings stand: \u201cThen God said, \u2018Let us make man in our image, in our likeness, and let them rule over the fish of the sea and the birds of the air, over the livestock, over all the earth,\u00a0and over all the creatures that move along the ground\u2019\u201d (Genesis 1.26 NIV). This view is not compatible with that of \u2018deep green\u2019 environmentalists, who hold to a radical ontological egalitarianism, that is, the view that all forms of being are basically equal. But nor is it compatible with andro-centric instrumentalism, that is, the view that non-human creation is available for humans to use just as they please. For, since the whole of creaturely hierarchy is subordinate to the Creator, human beings stand under God. Therefore, the dominion that they exercise over non-human creatures is delegated, subject to the Creator\u2019s values and intentions, and so accountable to his moral law. Their rule is that of a responsible steward, not an untrammelled tyrant.\n\n\u201cHear, O Israel: The Lord our God, the Lord is one!\u201d (Deuteronomy 6.4 NIV). According to biblical tradition, God is one. That means two things: first, there is one good God, unrivalled by any evil opponent; and second, this God is internally coherent or rational. When the one, rational God comes to create the world, he does so by distinguishing and ordering what he creates: God \u201cseparated the light from the darkness\u2026. God \u2026 separated the water under the expanse from the water above it\u201d (Genesis 1.3, 7 NIV). That is to say, the created world reflects the coherence, the rationality, the beauty, the order of the Creator. Monotheists, including Christians, have dogmatic reasons for assuming that the world is basically and constantly ordered and so, in principle, intelligible by human minds or \u2018rational\u2019. There are truths about reality that can be grasped. This assumption is basic to the natural sciences and should be basic to all academic endeavour.\n\nUnderstood in this light, academic work is fundamentally about discerning the truth about reality. The truth has to be discerned, because it is not always obvious. Sometimes reality is complicated and the complication challenges the limited powers of human comprehension. Sometimes human comprehension is not merely limited, but also distorted by sinful interests or prejudices. Some truths\u2014say, about biological or social reality\u2014are too uncomfortable to acknowledge; some distortions of the truth\u2014say, about race or colonial history\u2014advance careers. Therefore, the process of discerning the truth of things requires the virtues of humility, critical self-reflection, and openness to correction. It requires giving reasons, testing them, and learning from the results.\n\nOne implication is clear: academic work is necessarily social. We need other people to test our reasons, to propose new ones, and to help us learn. We also need other, reason-giving people who share with us a common recognition of the basic goal of our endeavours and of the moral duty to exercise the virtues required to achieve it. We need a moral community.\n\nThis Christian vision of academic work as virtuous rational exchange is not universally shared by those who work in higher education. Under the influence of Marxisant post-modernist philosophy\u2014especially Michel Foucault (1926-84)\u2014many are wont to view the reasons of others as merely the disguises of unjust power. Accordingly, reasons offered by academics supposed to be sitting in positions of privilege\u2014be it of class, race, or gender\u2014are not to be taken at face value, since they are merely the rationalisations of unjust interests. So, instead of subjecting the \u2018reasons\u2019 to rational testing, the rationaliser is subjected to personal attack and political manipulation.\n\nOf course, from a Christian point of view, it is more than possible that reasons given are the servants of sinful interests, perhaps rationalising unjust privileges on the one hand or unjust reparations on the other. [\u00a01\u00a0] Given the universality of sin, that will often be the case. The Enlightenment\u2019s modern faith in the purity and univocity of reason is indeed na\u00efve. However, sinful distortion applies to all reasons\u2014reasons offered by any one\u2014since \u201c all have sinned and fall short of the glory of God\u201d (Romans 3.23 NIV). It applies equally to modernists and post-modernists. The problem with the latter is that their cynicism is almost invariably directed elsewhere at selected others, never self-reflexively at the post-modernist. Sin always lies over there , never in here . Consequently, the post-modernist\u2019s self-righteousness dispenses her from having to answer counter-reasons. It renders her unaccountable. By the same token, it tends to make her authoritarian, intolerant, and disposed to patronise and abuse others.\n\nThe order which the one God impresses on the created world is not merely physical, but value-laden. Contrary to materialist philosophy, the Christian world-view holds that value is not reducible to matter, but co-original with it. [\u00a02\u00a0] The biblical Creator is identical with the divine Redeemer of the Hebrews from slavery in Egypt, and is assumed to be benevolent, willing what is good. Accordingly, the creation narrative in the book of Genesis tells us, repeatedly, that what God created was \u2018good\u2019 (verses 4, 10, 12, 18, 21, 25, 31). What is good is the foundation of moral order, since morally right behaviour defends or promotes what is good, while morally wrong behaviour damages it. What is good (or \u2018the Good\u2019) is the state in which a being flourishes as the kind of being it is. Different species flourish in different ways: what satisfies a rabbit will not satisfy a human being.\n\nThe co-originality of matter and value militates against the idea that human beings are, at base, motivated simply by the desire for physical survival and material betterment. However true that may have been of their origins, it is evident that human beings have genuinely evolved, so that now we are creatures that care about a range of goods\u2014not just material ones, but also immaterial ones. We are sometimes willing to forego food and sleep in our pursuit of the truth, and we are sometimes willing to risk our lives\u2014and lose them\u2014for the sake of justice. During the English Civil War, Thomas Hobbes (1588-1679) was composing his famous book, Leviathan , in the armchair safety of Paris, while his one-time friend and host, Lucius Carey, 2 nd Viscount Falkland, was back in England, fighting for King Charles. At the end of the battle of Kineton (or Edgehill) in 1642, Falkland interposed himself between his own victorious royalist comrades and a group of surrendered parliamentarians, to stop the former slaughtering the latter. That is to say, propelled by an overriding love of charitable justice, he risked his own life, not to save his progeny or his kin, nor even to save his friends or his allies, but to save a group of strangers and enemies. Thus, he gave the lie to Hobbes\u2019 cynical view of humans as driven basically by the fear of physical pain and death. Immaterial goods such moral integrity, the virtue of charity, and relations of justice can be very powerful motives. That is an empirical truth that social scientists, political philosophers, historians, and others in thrall to materialist metaphysics overlook.\n\nHow do we know what human flourishing and its component goods consist of? In three ways: empirical observation, analytic self-reflection, and special revelation.\n\nSince Christians have dogmatic reasons to believe that the world is a coherent whole, they believe in a universal order of value. Accordingly, they will expect to be able to observe the same basic values in different societies at different times and places. And this expectation is not disappointed: for example, all societies recognise the special value of human life by imposing laws that prohibit its taking except under special circumstances (although they may differ in their definition of \u2018human\u2019 and the exceptions to the rule); and all societies recognise the value of aesthetic experience by adding decoration to functional objects or by displaying works of art (although cultures may differ in their conceptions of beauty). Empirical observation, therefore, can help us identify the components of human flourishing or human goods.\n\nIn addition, analytical self-reflection can also reveal them\u2014as the Roman Catholic legal philosopher, John Finnis (1940- ), has argued. [\u00a03\u00a0] If we take any action that we are engaged in and interrogate its motives, we shall eventually hit bedrock in the form of one or more basic human goods. These goods are basic in the sense that their value is so self-evident that further interrogation seems absurd. Take this essay. Why am I writing it? Not for money, with which to buy food and drink and keep body and soul together, since no one is paying me and my bare words will not feed me. Proximately, I am writing to fulfil a promise I made. But we can dig deeper yet. Why did I make this particular promise in the first place? I did it, in order to work out and explain the world\u2019s ordering by God. But why did I want to do that? Because knowledge of the truth is important, and knowledge of this truth is especially important. Thus, we hit bedrock: the basic human good of knowledge of the truth. We need interrogate no further.\n\nEmpirical observation and analytical self-reflection will help to reveal the basic components of human flourishing. But since human cultures are subject to sinful distraction and distortion, we also need means of confirmation and correction. Here \u2018special revelation\u2019\u2014that is, biblical tradition and subsequent Christian reflection on it\u2014comes into play. Christians have always differed about the extent to which \u2018general revelation\u2019 through rational comprehension, observation, and self-reflection can be trusted. Martin Luther (1483-1546) was extremely sceptical about the capacity of reason, unaided by special revelation, to speak the truth\u2014as was Karl Barth (1886-1968) during the period of his \u2018theology of crisis\u2019 when he was reacting fiercely again his liberal theological heritage. [\u00a04\u00a0] Yet, Luther\u2019s younger collaborator, Philip Melanchthon (1497-1560), based his ethics very heavily on Aristotle (384-22 BC), and Barth in later years was happy to \u2018annex\u2019 the deliverances of non-Christian reason, provided that they were duly filtered through Christian theological premises. [\u00a05\u00a0] Thomas Aquinas (1225-74) got it right, I think, when he described the relation of special revelation to general revelation as one of confirming, supplementing, and correcting. [\u00a06\u00a0] Sometimes biblical tradition merely confirms what reason already affirms\u2014say, that marital constancy, providing stability for the upbringing of children, is a basic human, social good. Sometimes tradition supplements reason\u2014say, adding friendship with God to Aristotle\u2019s conception of the good life. And sometimes, tradition corrects reason\u2014say, by contradicting a narrow social or racial definition of what is \u2018human\u2019.\n\nGoods are the fundamental principles of a moral system, being logically prior to moral rules of conduct. Morally right conduct promotes the goods; morally wrong conduct detracts from them. This priority is important, partly because it is otherwise impossible to explain satisfactorily why moral rules carry the authority that they do and why it is that one should heed them. Moreover, it prevents moral rules from being perceived in ultimately negative terms as constraints that simply weigh down and frustrate. If they do frustrate in the short term, it is only with a view, ultimately, to realising human flourishing. Shouldering moral obligations may be a burden but, ultimately, they are means of salvation. In case our view of the Bible\u2019s contribution to Christian ethics is too fixated upon the Ten Commandments or even on Jesus\u2019 summary double love commandment (Matthew 22.37-40), we should remember that before God gave the law to Moses on Mount Sinai, he first granted the Hebrews liberation from Egypt. We should also remember that it was Jesus himself, who said, \u201cthe sabbath was made for humankind, not humankind for the sabbath\u201d (Mark 2.27 NRSV).\n\nThe body of moral rules is the moral law\u2014or, as Roman Catholics commonly know it, the natural law. Monotheists, therefore, are led by the logic of their theology to believe in a created, given, natural, objective moral order, comprising basic human goods and moral law. This order is objective in the sense that it precedes, frames, and endows with moral weight the subjective choices of human creatures. This is the created, natural law to which St Paul alludes, when he writes that \u201cGentiles, who do not have the [revealed] law [of Moses], do by nature things required by the law\u2026. they show that the requirements of the [Mosaic] law are written on their hearts\u201d (Romans 2.14-15a NIV).\n\nSince this moral law is given in and with the created world as a whole, it is universal. Access to it, therefore, is possible in principle for anyone, regardless of time, place, and religious or philosophical commitment. In practice, of course, that access is hindered by the creaturely limitations of human reason and especially by its sinful distortion. However, unless one believes that such sinful distortion is absolute, and that apart from the grace of special revelation no true moral knowledge at all is possible\u2014and few Christian theologians have held consistently to that position\u2014then we should expect to find some accurate grasp of the natural moral law apart from the people of God. Indeed, the Bible itself did find that, when the authors of the Wisdom Literature in the Old Testament borrowed liberally from Egyptian sources, or when the authors of New Testament epistles incorporated conventional Roman morality into their so-called \u2018household codes\u2019 (e.g., Ephesians 5.22-6.9; Colossians 3.18-4.1). More recently, when I attended a conference on \u201cWar and Peace, East and West\u201d in Hong Kong in 2013, I discovered that ancient and medieval Confucian ethics of war affirmed several of the principles articulated by Christian \u2018just war\u2019 reasoning, despite the fact that the Confucian and Latin Christian traditions had developed entirely independently of each other until the modern period. In other words, they had arrived at very similar moral conclusions by completely separate routes. Confucian thinkers had not needed the Bible to put their fingers on the pulse of some moral truths.\n\nThe created, given, objective moral order, therefore, does offer the possibility of a measure of moral consensus across cultures, and between Christians and non-Christians. However, whatever consensus emerges will be imperfect and tense, containing significant points of disagreement. [\u00a07\u00a0]\n\nFor example, Christians will recognise the basic human good of friendship with God, which atheists will deny. And Christians\u2019 view of the kinds of action that defend and promote the goods will be refracted by their theological lens, in particular their belief in the universality of sin and God\u2019s saving activity. So, in contrast to Immanuel Kant, who regarded specifically religious practices as distractions from the moral task, they will put acts of worship at the heart of their ethic. The confession of sins, participation in the eucharistic reprise of the Last Supper, commemoration of the crucifixion of Jesus, celebration of his Resurrection, and prayer for the final coming of God\u2019s kingdom will be viewed as essential spiritual remedies, which enable sinners to defend and promote goods. These remedial spiritual practices in general will entrench the idea, notwithstanding Aristotle, that humility is an obligatory virtue. In particular, contemplation of the Cross will make patience in suffering, not martial valour, the paradigm of the virtue of fortitude; and receiving the bread of fellowship from the about-to-be-betrayed Christ will dispose the communicant to put forgiveness (in some sense) at the heart of doing justice.\n\nSince all human beings exist in the one world of God\u2019s creating, subject to the same universal divine order, some consensus about what is good and right is to be expected and can be found. International agreements and institutions and cross-cultural enterprises, therefore, may involve common moral elements. However, Christians\u2019 view of the human condition and belief in God\u2019s saving activity occasion specific understandings of human goods and virtues, which not everyone will share. Cross-cultural or public agreement, therefore, will always contain a measure of disagreement. Consensus will be tense.\n\nChristians are, like Jews and Muslims, monotheists. Unlike Jews and Muslims, however, they are trinitarian monotheists. The one God is triune, comprising Father, Son, and Holy Spirit.\n\nSince the 1980s, \u2018social trinitarians\u2019 such as J\u00fcrgen Moltmann (1926- ) have proposed the divine Trinity as the epistemological basis for a thoroughly social, anti-individualist understanding of human existence\u2014human beings as always individuals-in-community. I myself doubt that trinitarian monotheism is the original source of our knowledge of the properly communal form of human life. After all, Aristotle described us as social animals several centuries before the doctrine of the Trinity was articulated. Further, thinking of the three \u2018persons\u2019 of the Trinity as distinct individuals does not quite square with the orthodox formulation.\n\nNevertheless, the doctrine of the triune God does tell us that the Alpha and the Omega, the Beginning and the End of all things, is much more like a community than an isolated monad. The divine unity contains plurality and, with it, the vitality of free interaction. And since the creation reflects its Creator, the created order is not a silent, barren thing, but contains\u2014both limiting and including\u2014plurality, vitality, and freedom. God\u2019s order is not dead; it is dynamic.\n\nOrder need not be at odds with freedom. In the material dimension, physical laws accommodate quantum randomness. In the aesthetic dimension, familiarity with natural patterns and conventional rules is requisite for successful improvisation. In the value dimension, the moral order does not stifle human freedom. On the contrary, it provides a given framework that endows free human choices with meaning. As the Roman Catholic philosopher, Charles Taylor (1931- ), has written: \u201cEven the sense that the significance of my life comes from its being chosen \u2026 depends on the understanding that independent of my will there is something noble, courageous, and hence significant in giving shape to my own life\u2026. Horizons are given\u201d. [\u00a08\u00a0]\n\nMoreover, the givenness of human goods and consequent moral rules does not determine the application of those rules to particular circumstances. That task remains open for morally responsible human beings to perform by the free and creative use of their reason in making judgements. The making of moral judgements is often more than merely a mechanical exercise of applying ready-made rules to cases. Moral rules are always formulated with paradigmatic cases in mind\u2014unequivocal examples of murder or lying, say, where the wrongness of the act is straightforwardly clear. But life often presents us with circumstances that contain features where the obvious wrongness is absent\u2014as in cases of voluntary euthanasia motivated by compassion, say, or of hiding the truth from someone who would use it to harm others. Faced with such cases, we cannot mindlessly apply the ready-made rule, because the circumstances force us to judge whether what we have here is really a case of murder or lying at all. And that requires us to think about what exactly is meant by \u2018murder\u2019 or \u2018lying\u2019, and what exactly is supposed to make them wrong. The upshot of this process of critical reflection may be that we refine or qualify the inherited moral rule. But whatever the conclusion, the process itself involves, not just blind following and mechanical application, but creative re-thinking and re- imagining.\n\nSo, for example, one implication of this is that human rights lawyers and advocates should be sensitive to the contingency of human rights upon political, social and economic circumstances. So when, as in post-genocidal Rwanda, sufficient lawyers cannot be obtained, prisoners awaiting trial are dying in over-crowded prisons, and there is an urgent need to speed up the processing of cases, they should recognise that it would be imprudent to insist that the right to a fair trial must include access to legal counsel. [\u00a09\u00a0]\n\nIn biblical tradition there is a strong egalitarian refrain. All human beings are made in the image of God. All humans are equally children of God and sinners standing in need of God\u2019s grace. According to St Paul, \u201c[t]here is neither Jew nor Greek, slave nor free, male nor female, for you are all one in Christ Jesus\u201d (Galatians 3.28 NIV). This might seem consonant with the absolute antipathy toward hierarchy that is found among some feminists, and therefore in the academic study of gender. There, hierarchy is assumed to embody unequal power and therefore oppression.\n\nHowever, biblical tradition and Christian theology take a more nuanced position. First of all, there is the basic relationship between the Creator and his creatures, which is one of ontological and moral inequality: the latter are unequal to the former in power, wisdom, and moral integrity. Further, in a sinful world, where some are inclined to abuse others, there is a need for a state to create and uphold law, in order to protect the innocent: rulers necessarily stand in an unequal relation to the ruled. Further still, although everyone is equally a sinner, virtue is unequally distributed.\n\nIn addition, general human experience tells us that any large and complex human association has to develop a division of labour, which naturally organises itself into a hierarchy, with directors at the top and executors below.\n\nSo, as I read it, Christian theology cannot regard all forms of inequality as unjustified and all forms of hierarchical organisation as oppressive. That said, it does require those at the top of any hierarchy not to abuse their position by lording it over others, but instead to treat those functionally \u2018beneath\u2019 them with a certain respect. Thus St Paul exhorts the Christians in Philippi, \u201cYour attitude should be the same as that of Christ Jesus: Who, being in the very nature of God, did not consider equality with God something to be grasped, but made himself nothing, taking the very nature of a servant, being made in human likeness\u201d (Philippians 2.5-7 NIV). And when, in his first letter to the Corinthian Christians, he famously likens the Christian community\u2014and thereby the ideal human society\u2014to a physical body, he at once affirms hierarchy and equality:\n\nFor just as the body is one and has many members, and all the members of the body, though many, are one body, so it is with Christ.\u00a0For in the one Spirit we were all baptized into one body\u2014Jews or Greeks, slaves or free\u2014and we were all made to drink of one Spirit. Indeed, the body does not consist of one member but of many. If the foot would say, \u201cBecause I am not a hand, I do not belong to the body\u201d, that would not make it any less a part of the body.\u00a0And if the ear were to say, \u201cBecause I am not an eye, I do not belong to the body\u201d, that would not make it any less a part of the body. If the whole body were an eye, where would the hearing be? If the whole body were hearing, where would the sense of smell be? But as it is, God arranged the members in the body, each one of them, as he chose. If all were a single member, where would the body be? As it is, there are many members, yet one body. The eye cannot say to the hand, \u201cI have no need of you\u201d, nor again the head to the feet, \u201cI have no need of you\u201d. On the contrary, the members of the body that seem to be weaker are indispensable, and those members of the body that we think less honourable we clothe with greater honour, and our less respectable members are treated with greater respect;\u00a0whereas our more respectable members do not need this. But God has so arranged the body, giving the greater honour to the inferior member \u2026. (I Corinthians 12.12-25, NRSV)\n\nThere is certainly hierarchy here: some members are heads and eyes, others are hands and feet; some direct, others execute; some are higher, others lower. If everyone tried to direct, there would be at once cacophony and total ineffectuality. To function at all, there has to be a hierarchical division of labour. That said, every member is equally important to the optimal functioning of the whole. And that is what those at the top most need to remember: that those beneath them are equally indispensable.\n\nWe find the same line of thinking in St Paul\u2019s letter to Philemon. Philemon\u2019s slave Onesimus, has run away to Paul. Paul has decided to return him, thus respecting the institution of domestic slavery. Yet, in doing so, Paul urges Philemon to receive Onesimus back \u201cno longer as a slave, but better than a slave, as a dear brother\u201d (Philemon 1.16 NIV). Functional hierarchy is morally unobjectionable, so long as functional superiors regard functional inferiors fraternally.\n\nChristians are not Hobbesians. According to Thomas Hobbes, there is neither morality nor justice before humans enter into social contracts; there is only the drive for self-preservation and the war of each against all. (Hobbes muddies the waters here by calling this drive a \u2018natural right\u2019. But since, as he has it, there is no natural morality, the word \u2018right\u2019, with its connotation of moral authority, is a confusing misnomer.) This vision of the human condition is fundamentally amoral. In contrast, as we have seen, Christian monotheism implies a universal moral order or natural law that exists where there is no contract. Morality does not follow social contracts; being based on the created order of value, it precedes them. This view is typical of the natural law thinking that can be found in Thomas Aquinas, through the Salamancan Scholastics Francisco de Vitoria (1483-1546) and Francisco Suarez (1548-1617), to the Arminian Calvinist Hugo Grotius (1583-1645) and the Anglican John Locke (1632-1704).\n\nHumanly posited (\u2018positive\u2019) law is the product of a society and so follows the making of a social contract. From a Christian point of view, positive law is not the beginning of morality or justice; rather, it is accountable to them\u2014primarily through the operations of individual conscience. There can, therefore, be such things as an unjust law and morally justified transgression of it.\n\nEven when law is not unjust, it will often not mirror natural morality exactly. That is partly because law is the product of a political process, which usually involves compromise. It is also because, were all immorality to be prohibited by law, the state would be accorded the dangerous authority to intrude intimately in the lives of citizens. It would also be burdened with a massive task of policing that would be practically impossible to discharge. Therefore, for example, while the law might prohibit speech that incites hatred on the grounds of race, religion, and sexual orientation, it wisely does not prohibit other immoral speech that is gratuitously insulting or provocative, or that deliberately misrepresents what other people have said or written. Even just laws rightly allow immoral conduct.\n\nEven where there is no positive law or where that law is ineffective\u2014say, in the case of a failed state\u2014the natural moral law remains. And where that commands the moral consciences of human beings, it has the power to constrain and guide. However, as biblical and Christian tradition lead us to expect, and as experience surely confirms, consciences, being sinful, are often not as sensitive as they should be. For that reason, in the absence of law, police, and courts, the protection of the innocent from abuse is much weaker.\n\nThe transcendence of the moral law also makes possible prophetic criticism of existing political order and resistance to positive law. This is because it provides a higher, moral authority to which critics of positive law can appeal, and which can provide moral justification for the defiance of such law\u2014which defiance is positively, but not morally, illegal. Accordingly, Thomas Aquinas in the 13 th century affirmed the possibility of resistance to tyrants, and the Reformers in the 16 th century endorsed the possibility of morally justified rebellion and regime-change.\n\nHowever, since sheer anarchy permits the strong to oppress the weak with impunity, prudence may oblige the tolerance of a regime and laws that, while unjust, are not gravely so. And even when the injustice is grave enough to warrant resistance, rebellion should be carried out\u2014according to the Lutheran Magdeburg Confession of 1550\u2014under the control of \u2018lesser magistrates\u2019. Writing in the light of German attempts to dislodge the Nazi regime in the 1930s and \u201840s, the Lutheran theologian, Helmuth Thielicke, stipulated that rebellion is only justified when the rebels have an alternative government ready-to-hand. [\u00a010\u00a0] Resistance to unjust order\u2014whether in the form of civil disobedience of the law or armed revolt\u2014may be morally justified, but it must avoid giving rise to sheer, anarchical disorder.\n\nAs with positive law, so with international law: even where there are no contracts, treaties, or conventions between different states\u2014where there is no international law\u2014moral law still obtains. Insofar as this law commands the consciences of national leaders, it introduces a measure of order to relations between states. However, since the consciences of political leaders can be dull as well as sensitive, states sometimes fail to do as they should and do as they should not. They cannot always be relied upon to do what natural moral law obliges. Conscience, though not always at fault, cannot be relied upon. For that reason, effective international order requires the additional constraints of international law, whether in the form of a consensus of opinion, the harder form of custom, or the hardest form of treaty.\n\nSince cooperation, predictability, and trust are important instrumental goods in international relations, upholding the authority of international law is important. Since there is no global government, and since the United Nations has no standing army with which to enforce the law, that authority depends very heavily on the widespread willingness of states to respect the law, whether out of a sense of personal integrity or because of the diplomatic value of being regarded as trustworthy. If one state should decide to take the liberty of breaking the law and jettisoning its constraints, other states will begin to wonder why they should continue to put up with them. And if a sufficient number of powerful states abandon those constraints, the law\u2019s authority will collapse, it will become a dead letter, and international relations will enter a dangerous era of high unpredictability, low trust, and extraordinary susceptibility to armed conflict.\n\nNevertheless, it remains true that positive international law is not the last word, and that natural moral duty may sometimes justify its transgression. This receives recognition among lawyers in the form of the concept of ius cogens , that is, overriding or \u2018compelling\u2019 law. For example, there may be occasions when the UN\u2019s Security Council fails to authorise military intervention to halt very grave injustices such as ethnic cleansing or genocide, which threaten regional stability, but such intervention is nevertheless widely regarded as a moral imperative. This is what happened in 1999, when Russia, because of its cultural ties to Serbia, threatened to veto NATO\u2019s military intervention in Kosovo, to prevent the ethnic cleansing of Kosovar Muslims, but NATO, involving nineteen states, intervened anyway. As the eminent Finnish international legal expert Martti Koskenniemi commented, \u201cmost lawyers\u2014 including myself\u2014have taken the ambivalent position that [NATO\u2019s intervention] was both formally illegal and morally necessary\u201d. [\u00a011\u00a0]\n\nThe existence of a given, created order\u2014be it physical or aesthetic or moral\u2014implies that academic endeavour is properly about the discovery of the truth of reality as given by God. Of course, academics are sinners, just like everyone else. Consequently, their pursuit of truth can be corrupted by insecurity and the lust to dominate. It can be corrupted by selfish interests in maintaining or increasing economic, political, and social power, as postmodernists remind us. It can also be corrupted by the ordinary ambition to advance one\u2019s career.\n\nChristian academics, however, at once aware of their creaturely responsibility under God\u2019s created moral order and of their sinful failure to meet it, will be careful to cultivate\u2014not least by their own example\u2014the intellectual and academic virtues of humility (regarding the limits of their own knowledge), docility (or the readiness to learn), patience (in discerning the truth), justice (to what other people say), charity (toward unwelcome views), and courage (in asserting unpopular truths). Above all, Christian academics will remember that an academic career is a vocation to discover the truth in cooperation with others, not an opportunity for the proud and intimidating assertion of the ego.\n\nIn so doing, Christian professors will bear witness to the moral order that God has created. And where\u2014as in most contemporary universities\u2014the cultivation of virtue is neglected, that witness will be prophetic.\n\nBiggar, Nigel. Behaving in Public: How to do Christian ethics.

Introduction</h2>\n<p>Modern Western culture warms to freedom and shies away from order. Whereas \u2018freedom\u2019 connotes liberation, exhilaration, and vitality, \u2018order\u2019 connotes oppression, constraint, and sterility. The reasons for this cultural bias lie in historical experience. First of all, there was the long history of endeavour in England, Europe and America\u2014from the 13<sup>th</sup> to the 20<sup>th</sup> century\u2014to curb and overcome political orders perceived to be tyrannical. Then, more recently, after the Second World War, there was the youth revolt against stifling class prejudice, social convention, and, above all, traditional Christian sexual morality.</p>\n<p>Different histories, however, produce different biases. In China, for example, whose past is replete with periods of bloody anarchy, \u2018order\u2019 tends to mean political stability, the absence of the threat of arbitrary non-state violence, and the peaceful opportunity to plan and build a prosperous material life. By the same token, \u2018freedom\u2019 is disturbing and suspect. Confucian philosophy embodies this perspective in its high esteem for tradition and convention, and its subjection of the individual to the requirements of the community.</p>\n<p>Christianity\u2019s view of order is nuanced. On the one hand, the world is understood as the creation of a rational Creator. Therefore, it is intelligible: there are given structures, patterns and regularities\u2014orders\u2014that are objectively present for rational creatures like human beings to grasp. Among these are physical, biological, and social orders. But there is also one of values, which provides a framework for human choices and dignifies them with moral significance.</p>\n<p>On the other hand, within this framework there remains scope for individuals to choose freely which values to concentrate their lives upon, and how to defend and promote them, under prevailing circumstances\u2014be they historical, cultural, political, economic, or environmental\u2014and according to personal talent and taste. Moreover, this divinely created order of values, and the moral principles and rules it generates, comprise the basis of criticism of all human social and political orders, subject as they are to sinful corruption and distortion. The Creator and his creatures\u2014<i>a fortiori</i>, his sinful creatures\u2014are not identical and should not be confused. The divinely created order is one thing; human orders are another. The two are not the same and the latter cannot automatically claim the authority of the former. Judged in the light of divine order, any human order might be found morally wanting.</p>\n<p>In the essay that follows I will identify and discuss the main features of \u2018order\u2019 that come into focus from a Christian theological perspective. Since I am a <i>moral</i> theologian, whose interests and training concentrate on the moral or ethical dimension of theology, I shall have more to say on the ethical dimensions of the topic than on others. Had I been a <i>philosophical</i> theologian, I might have spent more time discussing physical, logical, or mathematical order. Unavoidably, the treatment of the topic that I offer here is constrained by the limits of my competence, although I have sought to test those limits, so as to make what I write relevant to as many academic disciplines as possible. Besides, since the main concern of biblical and subsequent Christian tradition is the salvation of God\u2019s creatures\u2014especially, his human creatures\u2014from the ravages of sin, it is not inappropriate for a theological treatise to focus on human agency and on what we humans ought, and ought not, to do in response to the creative and redemptive action of God.</p>\n<h2>2. God\u2019s creation has a hierarchy of being</h2>\n<p>God\u2019s creation encompasses the whole world, not just the human part of it. According to the first creation story in the book of Genesis, <i>all</i> of creation was beheld as good\u2014as having value\u2014in the eyes of God. Since they have value in God\u2019s eyes\u2014and not merely human ones\u2014non-human creatures have a worth that is somewhat independent of human uses. Yet, the first creation story in the book of Genesis is quite clear that plants and animals exist, in important part, to provide sustenance for human beings: <sup><b>\u201c</b></sup>Then God said, \u2018I give you every seed-bearing plant on the face of the whole earth and every tree that has fruit with seed in it. They will be yours for food.\u00a0And to all the beasts of the earth and all the birds of the air and all the creatures that move on the ground\u2014everything that has the breath of life in it\u2014I give every green plant for food\u2019\u201d\u00a0(Genesis 1, 29-30 NIV).</p>\n<p>In God\u2019s creation there is clearly a hierarchical order, at whose apex human beings stand: \u201cThen God said, \u2018Let us make man in our image, in our likeness, and let them rule over the fish of the sea and the birds of the air, over the livestock, over all the earth,\u00a0and over all the creatures that move along the ground\u2019\u201d (Genesis 1.26 NIV). This view is not compatible with that of \u2018deep green\u2019 environmentalists, who hold to a radical ontological egalitarianism, that is, the view that all forms of being are basically equal. But nor is it compatible with andro-centric instrumentalism, that is, the view that non-human creation is available for humans to use just as they please. For, since the whole of creaturely hierarchy is subordinate to the Creator, human beings stand under God. Therefore, the dominion that they exercise over non-human creatures is delegated, subject to the Creator\u2019s values and intentions, and so accountable to his moral law. Their rule is that of a responsible steward, not an untrammelled tyrant.</p>\n<h2><b>3. Monotheism entails</b><b> the intelligibility of created things, which authorises rational exchange</b></h2>\n<p>\u201cHear, O Israel: The Lord our God, the Lord is one!\u201d (Deuteronomy 6.4 NIV). According to biblical tradition, God is one. That means two things: first, there is one good God, unrivalled by any evil opponent; and second, this God is internally coherent or rational. When the one, rational God comes to create the world, he does so by distinguishing and ordering what he creates: God \u201cseparated the light from the darkness\u2026. God \u2026 separated the water under the expanse from the water above it\u201d (Genesis 1.3, 7 NIV). That is to say, the created world reflects the coherence, the rationality, the beauty, the order of the Creator. Monotheists, including Christians, have dogmatic reasons for assuming that the world is basically and constantly ordered and so, in principle, intelligible by human minds or \u2018rational\u2019. There are truths about reality that can be grasped. This assumption is basic to the natural sciences and should be basic to all academic endeavour.</p>\n<p>Understood in this light, academic work is fundamentally about discerning the truth about reality. The truth has to be discerned, because it is not always obvious. Sometimes reality is complicated and the complication challenges the limited powers of human comprehension. Sometimes human comprehension is not merely limited, but also distorted by sinful interests or prejudices. Some truths\u2014say, about biological or social reality\u2014are too uncomfortable to acknowledge; some distortions of the truth\u2014say, about race or colonial history\u2014advance careers. Therefore, the process of discerning the truth of things requires the virtues of humility, critical self-reflection, and openness to correction. It requires giving reasons, testing them, and learning from the results.</p>\n<p>One implication is clear: academic work is necessarily social. We need other people to test our reasons, to propose new ones, and to help us learn. We also need other, reason-giving people who share with us a common recognition of the basic goal of our endeavours and of the moral duty to exercise the virtues required to achieve it. We need a moral community.</p>\n<p>This Christian vision of academic work as virtuous rational exchange is not universally shared by those who work in higher education. Under the influence of Marxisant post-modernist philosophy\u2014especially Michel Foucault (1926-84)\u2014many are wont to view the reasons of others as merely the disguises of unjust power. Accordingly, reasons offered by academics supposed to be sitting in positions of privilege\u2014be it of class, race, or gender\u2014are not to be taken at face value, since they are merely the rationalisations of unjust interests. So, instead of subjecting the \u2018reasons\u2019 to rational testing, the rationaliser is subjected to personal attack and political manipulation.</p>\n<p>Of course, from a Christian point of view, it is more than possible that reasons given are the servants of sinful interests, perhaps rationalising unjust privileges on the one hand or unjust reparations on the other.<a class=\"anchor\" id=\"content100note1anc\" name=\"content100note1anc\">\u00a0</a><a class=\"note\" href=\"#content100note1sym\">[\u00a01\u00a0]</a> Given the universality of sin, that will often be the case. The Enlightenment\u2019s modern faith in the purity and univocity of reason is indeed na\u00efve. However, sinful distortion applies to <i>all</i> reasons\u2014reasons offered by <i>any</i>one\u2014since \u201c<i>all </i>have sinned and fall short of the glory of God\u201d (Romans 3.23 NIV). It applies equally to modernists and post-modernists. The problem with the latter is that their cynicism is almost invariably directed elsewhere at selected others, never self-reflexively at the post-modernist. Sin always lies <i>over there</i>, never <i>in here</i>. Consequently, the post-modernist\u2019s self-righteousness dispenses her from having to answer counter-reasons. It renders her unaccountable. By the same token, it tends to make her authoritarian, intolerant, and disposed to patronise and abuse others.</p>\n<h2>4. How the benevolence of God generates a created moral order whose basic elements are human goods</h2>\n<p>The order which the one God impresses on the created world is not merely physical, but value-laden. Contrary to materialist philosophy, the Christian world-view holds that value is not reducible to matter, but co-original with it.<a class=\"anchor\" id=\"content100note2anc\" name=\"content100note2anc\">\u00a0</a><a class=\"note\" href=\"#content100note2sym\">[\u00a02\u00a0]</a> The biblical Creator is identical with the divine Redeemer of the Hebrews from slavery in Egypt, and is assumed to be benevolent, willing what is good. Accordingly, the creation narrative in the book of Genesis tells us, repeatedly, that what God created was \u2018good\u2019 (verses 4, 10, 12, 18, 21, 25, 31). What is good is the foundation of moral order, since morally right behaviour defends or promotes what is good, while morally wrong behaviour damages it. What is good (or \u2018the Good\u2019) is the state in which a being flourishes as the kind of being it is. Different species flourish in different ways: what satisfies a rabbit will not satisfy a human being.</p>\n<p>The co-originality of matter and value militates against the idea that human beings are, at base, motivated simply by the desire for physical survival and material betterment. However true that may have been of their origins, it is evident that human beings have genuinely evolved, so that now we are creatures that care about a range of goods\u2014not just material ones, but also immaterial ones. We are sometimes willing to forego food and sleep in our pursuit of the truth, and we are sometimes willing to risk our lives\u2014and lose them\u2014for the sake of justice. During the English Civil War, Thomas Hobbes (1588-1679) was composing his famous book, <i>Leviathan</i>, in the armchair safety of Paris, while his one-time friend and host, Lucius Carey, 2<sup>nd</sup> Viscount Falkland, was back in England, fighting for King Charles. At the end of the battle of Kineton (or Edgehill) in 1642, Falkland interposed himself between his own victorious royalist comrades and a group of surrendered parliamentarians, to stop the former slaughtering the latter. That is to say, propelled by an overriding love of charitable justice, he risked his own life, not to save his progeny or his kin, nor even to save his friends or his allies, but to save a group of strangers and enemies. Thus, he gave the lie to Hobbes\u2019 cynical view of humans as driven basically by the fear of physical pain and death. Immaterial goods such moral integrity, the virtue of charity, and relations of justice can be very powerful motives. That is an empirical truth that social scientists, political philosophers, historians, and others in thrall to materialist metaphysics overlook.</p>\n<p>How do we know what human flourishing and its component goods consist of? In three ways: empirical observation, analytic self-reflection, and special revelation.</p>\n<h3>Empirical Observation</h3>\n<p>Since Christians have dogmatic reasons to believe that the world is a coherent whole, they believe in a universal order of value. Accordingly, they will expect to be able to observe the same basic values in different societies at different times and places. And this expectation is not disappointed: for example, all societies recognise the special value of human life by imposing laws that prohibit its taking except under special circumstances (although they may differ in their definition of \u2018human\u2019 and the exceptions to the rule); and all societies recognise the value of aesthetic experience by adding decoration to functional objects or by displaying works of art (although cultures may differ in their conceptions of beauty). Empirical observation, therefore, can help us identify the components of human flourishing or human goods.</p>\n<h3>Analytic Self-Reflection</h3>\n<p>In addition, analytical self-reflection can also reveal them\u2014as the Roman Catholic legal philosopher, John Finnis (1940- ), has argued.<a class=\"anchor\" id=\"content100note3anc\" name=\"content100note3anc\">\u00a0</a><a class=\"note\" href=\"#content100note3sym\">[\u00a03\u00a0]</a> If we take any action that we are engaged in and interrogate its motives, we shall eventually hit bedrock in the form of one or more basic human goods. These goods are basic in the sense that their value is so self-evident that further interrogation seems absurd. Take this essay. Why am I writing it? Not for money, with which to buy food and drink and keep body and soul together, since no one is paying me and my bare words will not feed me. Proximately, I am writing to fulfil a promise I made. But we can dig deeper yet. Why did I make this particular promise in the first place? I did it, in order to work out and explain the world\u2019s ordering by God. But why did I want to do that? Because knowledge of the truth is important, and knowledge of <i>this</i> truth is especially important. Thus, we hit bedrock: the basic human good of knowledge of the truth. We need interrogate no further.</p>\n<h3>Special Revelation</h3>\n<p>Empirical observation and analytical self-reflection will help to reveal the basic components of human flourishing. But since human cultures are subject to sinful distraction and distortion, we also need means of confirmation and correction. Here \u2018special revelation\u2019\u2014that is, biblical tradition and subsequent Christian reflection on it\u2014comes into play. Christians have always differed about the extent to which \u2018general revelation\u2019 through rational comprehension, observation, and self-reflection can be trusted. Martin Luther (1483-1546) was extremely sceptical about the capacity of reason, unaided by special revelation, to speak the truth\u2014as was Karl Barth (1886-1968) during the period of his \u2018theology of crisis\u2019 when he was reacting fiercely again his liberal theological heritage.<a class=\"anchor\" id=\"content100note4anc\" name=\"content100note4anc\">\u00a0</a><a class=\"note\" href=\"#content100note4sym\">[\u00a04\u00a0]</a> Yet, Luther\u2019s younger collaborator, Philip Melanchthon (1497-1560), based his ethics very heavily on Aristotle (384-22 BC), and Barth in later years was happy to \u2018annex\u2019 the deliverances of non-Christian reason, provided that they were duly filtered through Christian theological premises.<a class=\"anchor\" id=\"content100note5anc\" name=\"content100note5anc\">\u00a0</a><a class=\"note\" href=\"#content100note5sym\">[\u00a05\u00a0]</a> Thomas Aquinas (1225-74) got it right, I think, when he described the relation of special revelation to general revelation as one of confirming, supplementing, and correcting.<a class=\"anchor\" id=\"content100note6anc\" name=\"content100note6anc\">\u00a0</a><a class=\"note\" href=\"#content100note6sym\">[\u00a06\u00a0]</a> Sometimes biblical tradition merely confirms what reason already affirms\u2014say, that marital constancy, providing stability for the upbringing of children, is a basic human, social good. Sometimes tradition supplements reason\u2014say, adding friendship with God to Aristotle\u2019s conception of the good life. And sometimes, tradition corrects reason\u2014say, by contradicting a narrow social or racial definition of what is \u2018human\u2019.</p>\n<h2>5. How basic human goods generate natural moral law</h2>\n<p>Goods are the fundamental principles of a moral system, being logically prior to moral rules of conduct. Morally right conduct promotes the goods; morally wrong conduct detracts from them. This priority is important, partly because it is otherwise impossible to explain satisfactorily why moral rules carry the authority that they do and why it is that one should heed them. Moreover, it prevents moral rules from being perceived in ultimately negative terms as constraints that simply weigh down and frustrate. If they do frustrate in the short term, it is only with a view, ultimately, to realising human flourishing. Shouldering moral obligations may be a burden but, ultimately, they are means of salvation. In case our view of the Bible\u2019s contribution to Christian ethics is too fixated upon the Ten Commandments or even on Jesus\u2019 summary double love commandment (Matthew 22.37-40), we should remember that before God gave the law to Moses on Mount Sinai, he first granted the Hebrews liberation from Egypt. We should also remember that it was Jesus himself, who said, \u201cthe sabbath was made for humankind, not humankind for the sabbath\u201d (Mark 2.27 NRSV).</p>\n<p>The body of moral rules is the moral law\u2014or, as Roman Catholics commonly know it, the natural law. Monotheists, therefore, are led by the logic of their theology to believe in a created, given, natural, objective moral order, comprising basic human goods and moral law. This order is objective in the sense that it precedes, frames, and endows with moral weight the subjective choices of human creatures. This is the created, natural law to which St Paul alludes, when he writes that \u201cGentiles, who do not have the [revealed] law [of Moses], do by nature things required by the law\u2026. they show that the requirements of the [Mosaic] law are written on their hearts\u201d (Romans 2.14-15a NIV).</p>\n<p>Since this moral law is given in and with the created world as a whole, it is universal. Access to it, therefore, is possible in principle for anyone, regardless of time, place, and religious or philosophical commitment. In practice, of course, that access is hindered by the creaturely limitations of human reason and especially by its sinful distortion. However, unless one believes that such sinful distortion is absolute, and that apart from the grace of special revelation no true moral knowledge at all is possible\u2014and few Christian theologians have held consistently to that position\u2014then we should expect to find some accurate grasp of the natural moral law apart from the people of God. Indeed, the Bible itself did find that, when the authors of the Wisdom Literature in the Old Testament borrowed liberally from Egyptian sources, or when the authors of New Testament epistles incorporated conventional Roman morality into their so-called \u2018household codes\u2019 (e.g., Ephesians 5.22-6.9; Colossians 3.18-4.1). More recently, when I attended a conference on \u201cWar and Peace, East and West\u201d in Hong Kong in 2013, I discovered that ancient and medieval Confucian ethics of war affirmed several of the principles articulated by Christian \u2018just war\u2019 reasoning, despite the fact that the Confucian and Latin Christian traditions had developed entirely independently of each other until the modern period. In other words, they had arrived at very similar moral conclusions by completely separate routes. Confucian thinkers had not needed the Bible to put their fingers on the pulse of some moral truths.</p>\n<h2>6. How \u2018tense consensus\u2019 about moral matters between Christian and non-Christians is possible</h2>\n<p>The created, given, objective moral order, therefore, does offer the possibility of a measure of moral consensus across cultures, and between Christians and non-Christians. However, whatever consensus emerges will be imperfect and tense, containing significant points of disagreement.<a class=\"anchor\" id=\"content100note7anc\" name=\"content100note7anc\">\u00a0</a><a class=\"note\" href=\"#content100note7sym\">[\u00a07\u00a0]</a></p>\n<p>For example, Christians will recognise the basic human good of friendship with God, which atheists will deny. And Christians\u2019 view of the kinds of action that defend and promote the goods will be refracted by their theological lens, in particular their belief in the universality of sin and God\u2019s saving activity. So, in contrast to Immanuel Kant, who regarded specifically religious practices as distractions from the moral task, they will put acts of worship at the heart of their ethic. The confession of sins, participation in the eucharistic reprise of the Last Supper, commemoration of the crucifixion of Jesus, celebration of his Resurrection, and prayer for the final coming of God\u2019s kingdom will be viewed as essential spiritual remedies, which enable sinners to defend and promote goods. These remedial spiritual practices in general will entrench the idea, notwithstanding Aristotle, that humility is an obligatory virtue. In particular, contemplation of the Cross will make patience in suffering, not martial valour, the paradigm of the virtue of fortitude; and receiving the bread of fellowship from the about-to-be-betrayed Christ will dispose the communicant to put forgiveness (in some sense) at the heart of doing justice.</p>\n<p>Since all human beings exist in the one world of God\u2019s creating, subject to the same universal divine order, some consensus about what is good and right is to be expected and can be found. International agreements and institutions and cross-cultural enterprises, therefore, may involve common moral elements. However, Christians\u2019 view of the human condition and belief in God\u2019s saving activity occasion specific understandings of human goods and virtues, which not everyone will share. Cross-cultural or public agreement, therefore, will always contain a measure of disagreement. Consensus will be tense.</p>\n<h2>7. Trinitarian monotheism entails a created order that is dynamic</h2>\n<p>Christians are, like Jews and Muslims, monotheists. Unlike Jews and Muslims, however, they are trinitarian monotheists. The one God is triune, comprising Father, Son, and Holy Spirit.</p>\n<p>Since the 1980s, \u2018social trinitarians\u2019 such as J\u00fcrgen Moltmann (1926- ) have proposed the divine Trinity as the epistemological basis for a thoroughly social, anti-individualist understanding of human existence\u2014human beings as always individuals-in-community. I myself doubt that trinitarian monotheism is the original source of our knowledge of the properly communal form of human life. After all, Aristotle described us as social animals several centuries before the doctrine of the Trinity was articulated. Further, thinking of the three \u2018persons\u2019 of the Trinity as distinct individuals does not quite square with the orthodox formulation.</p>\n<p>Nevertheless, the doctrine of the triune God does tell us that the Alpha and the Omega, the Beginning and the End of all things, is much more like a community than an isolated monad. The divine unity contains plurality and, with it, the vitality of free interaction. And since the creation reflects its Creator, the created order is not a silent, barren thing, but contains\u2014both limiting and including\u2014plurality, vitality, and freedom. God\u2019s order is not dead; it is dynamic.</p>\n<h2>8. Created order is compatible with creative freedom</h2>\n<p>Order need not be at odds with freedom. In the material dimension, physical laws accommodate quantum randomness. In the aesthetic dimension, familiarity with natural patterns and conventional rules is requisite for successful improvisation. In the value dimension, the moral order does not stifle human freedom. On the contrary, it provides a given framework that endows free human choices with meaning. As the Roman Catholic philosopher, Charles Taylor (1931- ), has written: \u201cEven the sense that the significance of my life comes from its being chosen \u2026 depends on the understanding that independent of my will there is something noble, courageous, and hence significant in giving shape to my own life\u2026. Horizons are given\u201d.<a class=\"anchor\" id=\"content100note8anc\" name=\"content100note8anc\">\u00a0</a><a class=\"note\" href=\"#content100note8sym\">[\u00a08\u00a0]</a></p>\n<p>Moreover, the givenness of human goods and consequent moral rules does not determine the application of those rules to particular circumstances. That task remains open for morally responsible human beings to perform by the free and creative use of their reason in making judgements. The making of moral judgements is often more than merely a mechanical exercise of applying ready-made rules to cases. Moral rules are always formulated with paradigmatic cases in mind\u2014unequivocal examples of murder or lying, say, where the wrongness of the act is straightforwardly clear. But life often presents us with circumstances that contain features where the obvious wrongness is absent\u2014as in cases of voluntary euthanasia motivated by compassion, say, or of hiding the truth from someone who would use it to harm others. Faced with such cases, we cannot mindlessly apply the ready-made rule, because the circumstances force us to judge whether what we have here is really a case of murder or lying at all. And that requires us to think about what exactly is meant by \u2018murder\u2019 or \u2018lying\u2019, and what exactly is supposed to make them wrong. The upshot of this process of critical reflection may be that we refine or qualify the inherited moral rule. But whatever the conclusion, the process itself involves, not just blind following and mechanical application, but creative re-thinking and re- imagining.</p>\n<p>So, for example, one implication of this is that human rights lawyers and advocates should be sensitive to the contingency of human rights upon political, social and economic circumstances. So when, as in post-genocidal Rwanda, sufficient lawyers cannot be obtained, prisoners awaiting trial are dying in over-crowded prisons, and there is an urgent need to speed up the processing of cases, they should recognise that it would be imprudent to insist that the right to a fair trial must include access to legal counsel.<a class=\"anchor\" id=\"content100note9anc\" name=\"content100note9anc\">\u00a0</a><a class=\"note\" href=\"#content100note9sym\">[\u00a09\u00a0]</a></p>\n<h2>9. Moral law authorises a social order that contains both equality and hierarchy</h2>\n<p>In biblical tradition there is a strong egalitarian refrain. All human beings are made in the image of God. All humans are equally children of God and sinners standing in need of God\u2019s grace. According to St Paul, \u201c[t]here is neither Jew nor Greek, slave nor free, male nor female, for you are all one in Christ Jesus\u201d (Galatians 3.28 NIV). This might seem consonant with the absolute antipathy toward hierarchy that is found among some feminists, and therefore in the academic study of gender. There, hierarchy is assumed to embody unequal power and therefore oppression.</p>\n<p>However, biblical tradition and Christian theology take a more nuanced position. First of all, there is the basic relationship between the Creator and his creatures, which is one of ontological and moral inequality: the latter are unequal to the former in power, wisdom, and moral integrity. Further, in a sinful world, where some are inclined to abuse others, there is a need for a state to create and uphold law, in order to protect the innocent: rulers necessarily stand in an unequal relation to the ruled. Further still, although everyone is equally a sinner, virtue is unequally distributed.</p>\n<p>In addition, general human experience tells us that any large and complex human association has to develop a division of labour, which naturally organises itself into a hierarchy, with directors at the top and executors below.</p>\n<p>So, as I read it, Christian theology cannot regard all forms of inequality as unjustified and all forms of hierarchical organisation as oppressive. That said, it does require those at the top of any hierarchy not to abuse their position by lording it over others, but instead to treat those functionally \u2018beneath\u2019 them with a certain respect. Thus St Paul exhorts the Christians in Philippi, \u201cYour attitude should be the same as that of Christ Jesus: Who, being in the very nature of God, did not consider equality with God something to be grasped, but made himself nothing, taking the very nature of a servant, being made in human likeness\u201d (Philippians 2.5-7 NIV). And when, in his first letter to the Corinthian Christians, he famously likens the Christian community\u2014and thereby the ideal human society\u2014to a physical body, he at once affirms hierarchy and equality:</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>For just as the body is one and has many members, and all the members of the body, though many, are one body, so it is with Christ.\u00a0For in the one Spirit we were all baptized into one body\u2014Jews or Greeks, slaves or free\u2014and we were all made to drink of one Spirit. <sup><b>\u00a0</b></sup>Indeed, the body does not consist of one member but of many. If the foot would say, \u201cBecause I am not a hand, I do not belong to the body\u201d, that would not make it any less a part of the body.\u00a0And if the ear were to say, \u201cBecause I am not an eye, I do not belong to the body\u201d, that would not make it any less a part of the body.<sup><b>\u00a0</b></sup>If the whole body were an eye, where would the hearing be? If the whole body were hearing, where would the sense of smell be?<sup><b>\u00a0</b></sup>But as it is, God arranged the members in the body, each one of them, as he chose.<sup><b>\u00a0</b></sup>If all were a single member, where would the body be?\u00a0<sup><b>\u00a0</b></sup>As it is, there are many members, yet one body.<sup><b>\u00a0</b></sup>The eye cannot say to the hand, \u201cI have no need of you\u201d, nor again the head to the feet, \u201cI have no need of you\u201d.<sup><b>\u00a0</b></sup>On the contrary, the members of the body that seem to be weaker are indispensable, and those members of the body that we think less honourable we clothe with greater honour, and our less respectable members are treated with greater respect;\u00a0whereas our more respectable members do not need this. But God has so arranged the body, giving the greater honour to the inferior member \u2026. (I Corinthians 12.12-25, NRSV)</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>For just as the body is one and has many members, and all the members of the body, though many, are one body, so it is with Christ.\u00a0For in the one Spirit we were all baptized into one body\u2014Jews or Greeks, slaves or free\u2014and we were all made to drink of one Spirit. <sup><b>\u00a0</b></sup>Indeed, the body does not consist of one member but of many. If the foot would say, \u201cBecause I am not a hand, I do not belong to the body\u201d, that would not make it any less a part of the body.\u00a0And if the ear were to say, \u201cBecause I am not an eye, I do not belong to the body\u201d, that would not make it any less a part of the body.<sup><b>\u00a0</b></sup>If the whole body were an eye, where would the hearing be? If the whole body were hearing, where would the sense of smell be?<sup><b>\u00a0</b></sup>But as it is, God arranged the members in the body, each one of them, as he chose.<sup><b>\u00a0</b></sup>If all were a single member, where would the body be?\u00a0<sup><b>\u00a0</b></sup>As it is, there are many members, yet one body.<sup><b>\u00a0</b></sup>The eye cannot say to the hand, \u201cI have no need of you\u201d, nor again the head to the feet, \u201cI have no need of you\u201d.<sup><b>\u00a0</b></sup>On the contrary, the members of the body that seem to be weaker are indispensable, and those members of the body that we think less honourable we clothe with greater honour, and our less respectable members are treated with greater respect;\u00a0whereas our more respectable members do not need this. But God has so arranged the body, giving the greater honour to the inferior member \u2026. (I Corinthians 12.12-25, NRSV)</p>\n<p>There is certainly hierarchy here: some members are heads and eyes, others are hands and feet; some direct, others execute; some are higher, others lower. If everyone tried to direct, there would be at once cacophony and total ineffectuality. To function at all, there has to be a hierarchical division of labour. That said, every member is equally important to the optimal functioning of the whole. And that is what those at the top most need to remember: that those beneath them are equally indispensable.</p>\n<p>We find the same line of thinking in St Paul\u2019s letter to Philemon. Philemon\u2019s slave Onesimus, has run away to Paul. Paul has decided to return him, thus respecting the institution of domestic slavery. Yet, in doing so, Paul urges Philemon to receive Onesimus back \u201cno longer as a slave, but better than a slave, as a dear brother\u201d (Philemon 1.16 NIV). Functional hierarchy is morally unobjectionable, so long as functional superiors regard functional inferiors fraternally.</p>\n<h2>10. Human law and political order are subject to divinely created moral law</h2>\n<p>Christians are not Hobbesians. According to Thomas Hobbes, there is neither morality nor justice before humans enter into social contracts; there is only the drive for self-preservation and the war of each against all. (Hobbes muddies the waters here by calling this drive a \u2018natural right\u2019. But since, as he has it, there is no natural morality, the word \u2018right\u2019, with its connotation of moral authority, is a confusing misnomer.) This vision of the human condition is fundamentally amoral. In contrast, as we have seen, Christian monotheism implies a universal moral order or natural law that exists where there is no contract. Morality does not follow social contracts; being based on the created order of value, it precedes them. This view is typical of the natural law thinking that can be found in Thomas Aquinas, through the Salamancan Scholastics Francisco de Vitoria (1483-1546) and Francisco Suarez (1548-1617), to the Arminian Calvinist Hugo Grotius (1583-1645) and the Anglican John Locke (1632-1704).</p>\n<p>Humanly posited (\u2018positive\u2019) law is the product of a society and so follows the making of a social contract. From a Christian point of view, positive law is not the beginning of morality or justice; rather, it is accountable to them\u2014primarily through the operations of individual conscience. There can, therefore, be such things as an unjust law and morally justified transgression of it.</p>\n<p>Even when law is not unjust, it will often not mirror natural morality exactly. That is partly because law is the product of a political process, which usually involves compromise. It is also because, were all immorality to be prohibited by law, the state would be accorded the dangerous authority to intrude intimately in the lives of citizens. It would also be burdened with a massive task of policing that would be practically impossible to discharge. Therefore, for example, while the law might prohibit speech that incites hatred on the grounds of race, religion, and sexual orientation, it wisely does not prohibit other immoral speech that is gratuitously insulting or provocative, or that deliberately misrepresents what other people have said or written. Even just laws rightly allow immoral conduct.</p>\n<h2>11. Moral law remains authoritative when political order is absent or unjust</h2>\n<p>Even where there is no positive law or where that law is ineffective\u2014say, in the case of a failed state\u2014the natural moral law remains. And where that commands the moral consciences of human beings, it has the power to constrain and guide. However, as biblical and Christian tradition lead us to expect, and as experience surely confirms, consciences, being sinful, are often not as sensitive as they should be. For that reason, in the absence of law, police, and courts, the protection of the innocent from abuse is much weaker.</p>\n<p>The transcendence of the moral law also makes possible prophetic criticism of existing political order and resistance to positive law. This is because it provides a higher, moral authority to which critics of positive law can appeal, and which can provide moral justification for the defiance of such law\u2014which defiance is positively, but not morally, illegal. Accordingly, Thomas Aquinas in the 13<sup>th</sup> century affirmed the possibility of resistance to tyrants, and the Reformers in the 16<sup>th</sup> century endorsed the possibility of morally justified rebellion and regime-change.</p>\n<p>However, since sheer anarchy permits the strong to oppress the weak with impunity, prudence may oblige the tolerance of a regime and laws that, while unjust, are not gravely so. And even when the injustice is grave enough to warrant resistance, rebellion should be carried out\u2014according to the Lutheran Magdeburg Confession of 1550\u2014under the control of \u2018lesser magistrates\u2019. Writing in the light of German attempts to dislodge the Nazi regime in the 1930s and \u201840s, the Lutheran theologian, Helmuth Thielicke, stipulated that rebellion is only justified when the rebels have an alternative government ready-to-hand.<a class=\"anchor\" id=\"content100note10anc\" name=\"content100note10anc\">\u00a0</a><a class=\"note\" href=\"#content100note10sym\">[\u00a010\u00a0]</a> Resistance to unjust order\u2014whether in the form of civil disobedience of the law or armed revolt\u2014may be morally justified, but it must avoid giving rise to sheer, anarchical disorder.</p>\n<h2>12. International law, while important, may be trumped by moral law in international relations</h2>\n<p>As with positive law, so with international law: even where there are no contracts, treaties, or conventions between different states\u2014where there is no international law\u2014moral law still obtains. Insofar as this law commands the consciences of national leaders, it introduces a measure of order to relations between states. However, since the consciences of political leaders can be dull as well as sensitive, states sometimes fail to do as they should and do as they should not. They cannot always be relied upon to do what natural moral law obliges. Conscience, though not always at fault, cannot be relied upon. For that reason, effective international order requires the additional constraints of international law, whether in the form of a consensus of opinion, the harder form of custom, or the hardest form of treaty.</p>\n<p>Since cooperation, predictability, and trust are important instrumental goods in international relations, upholding the authority of international law is important. Since there is no global government, and since the United Nations has no standing army with which to enforce the law, that authority depends very heavily on the widespread willingness of states to respect the law, whether out of a sense of personal integrity or because of the diplomatic value of being regarded as trustworthy. If one state should decide to take the liberty of breaking the law and jettisoning its constraints, other states will begin to wonder why they should continue to put up with them. And if a sufficient number of powerful states abandon those constraints, the law\u2019s authority will collapse, it will become a dead letter, and international relations will enter a dangerous era of high unpredictability, low trust, and extraordinary susceptibility to armed conflict.</p>\n<p>Nevertheless, it remains true that positive international law is not the last word, and that natural moral duty may sometimes justify its transgression. This receives recognition among lawyers in the form of the concept of <i>ius cogens</i>, that is, overriding or \u2018compelling\u2019 law. For example, there may be occasions when the UN\u2019s Security Council fails to authorise military intervention to halt very grave injustices such as ethnic cleansing or genocide, which threaten regional stability, but such intervention is nevertheless widely regarded as a moral imperative. This is what happened in 1999, when Russia, because of its cultural ties to Serbia, threatened to veto NATO\u2019s military intervention in Kosovo, to prevent the ethnic cleansing of Kosovar Muslims, but NATO, involving nineteen states, intervened anyway. As the eminent Finnish international legal expert Martti Koskenniemi commented, \u201cmost lawyers\u2014 including myself\u2014have taken the ambivalent position that [NATO\u2019s intervention] was both formally illegal and morally necessary\u201d.<a class=\"anchor\" id=\"content100note11anc\" name=\"content100note11anc\">\u00a0</a><a class=\"note\" href=\"#content100note11sym\">[\u00a011\u00a0]</a></p>\n<h2>13. Since academic endeavour is properly about the discovery of the truth, Christian academics will cultivate intellectual virtues</h2>\n<p>The existence of a given, created order\u2014be it physical or aesthetic or moral\u2014implies that academic endeavour is properly about the discovery of the truth of reality as given by God. Of course, academics are sinners, just like everyone else. Consequently, their pursuit of truth can be corrupted by insecurity and the lust to dominate. It can be corrupted by selfish interests in maintaining or increasing economic, political, and social power, as postmodernists remind us. It can also be corrupted by the ordinary ambition to advance one\u2019s career.</p>\n<p>Christian academics, however, at once aware of their creaturely responsibility under God\u2019s created moral order and of their sinful failure to meet it, will be careful to cultivate\u2014not least by their own example\u2014the intellectual and academic virtues of humility (regarding the limits of their own knowledge), docility (or the readiness to learn), patience (in discerning the truth), justice (to what other people say), charity (toward unwelcome views), and courage (in asserting unpopular truths). Above all, Christian academics will remember that an academic career is a vocation to discover the truth in cooperation with others, not an opportunity for the proud and intimidating assertion of the ego.</p>\n<p>In so doing, Christian professors will bear witness to the moral order that God has created. And where\u2014as in most contemporary universities\u2014the cultivation of virtue is neglected, that witness will be prophetic.</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<h2>Further reading</h2>\n<p>Biggar, Nigel. <em>Behaving in Public: How to do Christian ethics.</em> Grand Rapids and Cambridge: Wipf &amp; Stock and James Clarke, 2014.

    "bodyText": "I anticipated that some readers would react to my \u2018conservative\u2019 choice of topic and affirmation of the good of order. I am aware that my position is one I take in reaction against the prevailing Zeitgeist , certainly in Western universities, which finds its inspiration in the social, cultural, and political rebellion of the 1960s. I can imagine other circumstances where I would put my weight on the other foot and talk up more loudly the virtues of disorder. But we are here, not there.\n\nOf the several colleagues who do talk up the value of disorder the first is David Mahan. Specifically, he recommends the virtue of contemplating the disorder of sin and, in particular, appreciating the difficulty that the victims of trauma often have in seeing moral order at all and believing in it. I take his point. I quite agree that bluntly asserting such order to such people would be pastorally stupid. It would also be unpersuasive. Evidently, there is a lot of moral disorder in the world, some of it horrific, and belief that it is not basic and will not triumph ultimately requires an act of faith.\n\nNevertheless, the empirical phenomena are ambiguous: there is good in the world as well as evil, or\u2014as Terence Malick\u2019s extraordinary 1998 film, The Thin Red Line , puts it\u2014glory as well as horror. And human beings who suffer injustice do have deeply implanted within them\u2014for a reason that begs explanation\u2014the conviction that things should be different. And hope that they will be different can in fact survive the most dreadful experiences. If I remember correctly, that was the gist of Viktor Frankel\u2019s 1946 book, Man\u2019s Search for Meaning , which observed that different Holocaust survivors reacted to their common experience in different ways. Not all were driven to despair and suicide; some had their faith and hope restored. Still, words alone will not suffice to save. That will require the powerful beauty of personal incarnations of moral order.\n\nIn my essay I say that the moral dimension of the created order of the world comprises, at base, human goods or aspects of human flourishing. At one point I also say that \u201cbasic human goods generate natural law\u201d. In asserting this, I implicitly reject the view that moral obligations are created by divine commands, because I object to the idea that morality is based on inscrutable, arbitrary divine fiats and to the allied picture of God as a despot who obliges something for no other reason than that he fancies it. Instead, it seems to me that the intrinsic worth of human goods, their beauty, their attractive power are quite sufficient to ground moral obligations. We ought to do something, because it will promote an intrinsically valuable good; we ought not to do something, because it will harm such a good. In brief, the law exists to serve human flourishing. Surely, no orthodox, Pauline Christian can think otherwise. Law is not its own justification. It is not the first and last word. It is not the point. For, as Jesus himself famously put it, \u201cThe Sabbath was made for Man, not Man for the Sabbath\u201d (Mark 2.27, KJV).\n\nAbout divine commands, Nicholas Wolterstorff agrees with me. However, he argues that human goods alone do not generate moral obligations, for some ways of promoting goods are not obligatory, and some ways of diminishing goods are not wrongful. So, in order to determine what is and is not obligatory, we need something beyond the goods themselves. We need, Wolterstorff argues, human dignity or \u201cthe worth of persons\u201d.\n\nI agree that goods alone do not determine obligations. Human dignity, however, seems to me a concept too vague to be helpful. I prefer a more definite alternative along the following lines. While talk simply of \u2018human goods\u2019 is succinct, it is too abstract to be sufficient. Rather, we should talk at greater length and more concretely of \u2018aspects of the common human flourishing of a human individual\u2019. No individual human being flourishes in quite the same way. Each individual develops some aspects of flourishing less, more, and differently than others\u2014contingent upon external circumstances, inner talent, and God\u2019s calling. Note that what commands our care, whether in promotion or defence, are still human goods, albeit as they are uniquely instantiated in a particular person.\n\nFurther, the reason that we are not always obliged to promote every human good is that we cannot. We lack sufficient resources of time and power to do so. That is why universal positive obligations are general, not specific. We are always obliged to love our neighbours in some fashion, but we are not always obliged to preserve their physical lives by feeding them, because sometimes we lack food ourselves.\n\nAnd we are not always obliged not to diminish a human good, because sometimes we find ourselves placed in tragic circumstances where we cannot defend the good of an innocent neighbour without damaging the good of the neighbour who is oppressing him. Whether or not it is right to damage the latter\u2019s good depends on three things. First, that there is an overriding duty to defend the innocent. Second, that the damage is unintended (that is, an unavoidable side effect of defending the innocent). And third, that it is proportionate (that is, no more than necessary to achieve the good, intended end).\n\nSo, I agree with Wolterstorff that the goods alone don\u2019t suffice to determine what is and is not obligatory. But I still think that it is the intrinsic value of human goods, uniquely instantiated in particular individuals, that generates such obligations as we have, even if other factors are required to determine what obligations obtain in particular circumstances.\n\nA second advocate of the value of disorder is Alan Bell, who asserts that \u201ctoo much emphasis on order ... runs the risk of leading to an alignment of Christianity with sociopolitical conservatism\u201d, and that \u201cJesus\u2019 mission had a strong strand of disordering built into it\u201d. Moreover, Bell suggests that my view of social hierarchy comes perilously close to rehearsing 19 th century anti-abolitionist arguments that \u201cslavery is fine as long as owners are nice to their slaves\u201d.\n\nOf course, I agree that there is such a thing as an excessive emphasis on order. I think that I was careful in my essay to distinguish between the divine moral order and human legal and political orders, and to make clear that the latter are subject to potentially disturbing judgement by the former. Surely, no follower of Jesus could suppose otherwise.\n\nOn the other hand, I do not read Jesus as an advocate of revolutionary politics in the modern sense of forced regime-change followed by state-sponsored, top-down social and economic reform. That option was open to him in the form of nationalist, Zealot opposition to foreign, imperial rule and he rejected it (John 6.15). And while he was fiercely critical of Jewish religious elites, he refused to be drawn into condemning Caesar\u2014\u201cGive to Caesar what is Caesar\u2019s \u2026\u201d (Mark 12.17)\u2014and commended one Roman (auxiliary) centurion as a paragon of faith (Matthew 8.5-10, 13). The kind of revolution that Jesus called for was organic, gradual, bottom-up\u2014as indicated by his use of the metaphors of yeast (or leaven) and mustard seed to describe the growth of God\u2019s kingdom (Matthew 13.31-33). His model of social, economic, and political change was closer to that of Edmund Burke than those of Robespierre or Lenin. And, at least in relation to the French Revolution, Burke is usually considered to be a conservative.\n\nMoreover, I do think that there are important truths that the alignment of Christianity with sociopolitical radicalism\u2014which is usual, in my experience, among academic colleagues\u2014obscures important truths. Moreover, it runs with \u2014 not against \u2014the flow of the \u2018progressive\u2019 Zeitgeist that now prevails in universities and therefore among cultural elites. That, in itself, does not make it wrong. But it ought to make it prima facie suspect among those who, following Jesus, should expect the Word of God to appear from left field. Therefore, to talk up important truths that regnant sociopolitical radicalism tends to overlook or downplay is, at this time and in this place, prophetic.\n\nAs for slavery, I do not think that a careful reader will infer that I think that it is okay so long as slave-owners treat slaves \u2018nicely\u2019. What I said was that functional hierarchies in which functional superiors treat functional inferiors \u201cfraternally\u201d are unobjectionable. Thereby, I alluded to Paul\u2019s injunction to Philemon to receive back his runaway slave, Onesimus, as \u201ca beloved brother\u201d (Philemon 1.15-16). When masters treat slaves \u2018fraternally\u2019\u2014not just \u2018nicely\u2019\u2014they treat them as, in a certain sense, equals. And in that case the institution of slavery, wherein the slave is the master\u2019s disposable property, cannot long survive. Note that for Paul, as for Jesus, the model of social change is organic, occurring from the inside outward.\n\nI share Javier S\u00e1nchez-Ca\u00f1izarez\u2019s interest in the question of the connection between belief in natural law\u2014or, better, natural moral order\u2014and belief in (the biblical) God. It is clear that the latter entails belief in the former: to believe in the one God who created the world out of chaos entails belief that the created world bears the marks of that God\u2019s moral coherence. It is not so clear, however, that the entailment works the other way around: that those who believe in a natural moral order are bound to believe in God\u2014or as S\u00e1nchez-Ca\u00f1izarez puts it, that \u201cintelligibility of the universe drives towards the acceptance of a personal Creator\u201d.\n\nAnd yet, it does seem to me that a vision of the universe as basically impersonal, blind, and heartless is naturally allied to a view of the human condition as basically amoral. It chimes with the Hobbesian view that, until human beings happen to make contracts or conventions or laws that promote their fundamental common interest in avoiding pain and death, there simply are no morality or justice. The idea that a heartless universe would throw up intrinsically valuable goods\u2014especially non-material, spiritual ones such as knowledge of the truth (regardless of its utility) and appreciation of sheer beauty\u2014seems most odd.\n\nTerry Halliday is another who talks up the value of disorder, when he writes that \u201c a vibrant social or legal order requires constant disturbance as a dynamic of adaptation \u201d. (The emphatic italics are his.) I agree with the basic point, namely, that all humanly created social or legal orders, being finite, fallible, and sinful, deserve to be disturbed into new and better forms. I would add the conservative qualification, however, that human flourishing is not compatible with constant social, legal, or political disturbance, if by that is meant permanent revolution. Human flourishing normally requires a social context that is considerably stable, predictable, and reliable. That, I take it, is why, in the 1950s and \u201860s, several million Chinese chose to flee the warn-torn and anarchic mainland of China for the British colony of Hong Kong, which, while not democratic, at least offered the considerable social benefit of the rule of law. Only when a political \u2018order\u2019 keeps the peace by means of arbitrary state-terror might human flourishing best be served by incurring the risks and hazards of political revolution.\n\nHalliday quite reasonably asks to see how, specifically, the created moral order bears critically upon social and legal orders. That would require the articulation of an account of human flourishing and its constituent goods, and of a set of moral principles and rules in the light of those goods and of human finitude, fallibility, and sinfulness. These rules would then have to be brought into dialogue with the particular social or legal matters under consideration. I say \u2018dialogue\u2019, because the content of moral rules is often refined and determined by the nature of the matter to which they are being applied. The matter sometimes talks back to the rules, which learn and adapt to it. It is not always passively subject to them. For that reason, the task of bringing the moral order to bear upon social and legal orders ought to be interdisciplinary, involving both Christian ethicists on the one hand, and social and political scientists on the other.\n\nOf course, human understanding of what the created moral order actually is, what its principles and rules are, and how it bears upon fields of human conduct is itself bound to be finite, fallible, and sinful. It will take various forms, relatively conflicting. The variety of vying Christian traditions of ethical reflection over two millennia bears ample witness to that. We cannot escape the cognitive limits of our human condition. All we can do is to put our best foot forward, absorb and sift the criticism conscientiously, adjust our direction accordingly, and keep on walking. After all, while we may be Christians, we remain sinful creatures, not gods.\n\nMy Oxford colleague, J\u00f6rg Friedrichs, tells a candid and moving story about how demanding the exercise of Christian virtues in the context of academic controversy can be. I stand and salute him! All I would add is to say that the manner in which Christian academics argue is quite as important, perhaps even more so, than the content of what they have to say.\n\nMy own experience of the \u2018culture war\u2019 over colonial history, since I was first dragged into it in December 2017, has revealed a shocking degree of aggressiveness, intemperance, and dishonesty on the part of some academic colleagues that I imagined to exist. I have learned that some abuse is best simply absorbed, that not everyone who addresses one deserves a response, that some want a no-holds-barred fight rather than a conversation, and that maintaining one\u2019s dignity and staying doggedly (even if sharply) reasonable is important above all else. It may not impress (at least in the short term) the colleague who is shouting in your face, but it may well impress the dozens or hundreds or (online) thousands who are watching.\n\nI am convinced that in the current climate, Christians, believing as we do in our common subjection to the Truth and feeling obliged by the virtues required to approximate it more closely, have a very important, prophetic role to play in keeping campus controversy civil, showing students how to handle it well, and thereby populating society with graduate citizens trained to so restrain themselves as to be capable of respecting the right of others to speak freely. Legal rights require a virtuous citizenry to have effect.\n\nIn his cross-cultural comparison, K. K. Yeo tells us that in Confucian thought order does not overcome chaos but co-exists with it in \u201ca dynamic relationship\u201d. It is not quite clear what Yeo himself thinks of this idea, but it strikes me as odd. I can understand it as a description of an experience of history as an unavoidable cycle of order and chaos. I can also make sense of it, if I substitute the word \u2018disorder\u2019 for \u2018chaos\u2019 and understand it along the lines that several respondents have already asserted\u2014that finite, fallible, and fallen human orders invariably need moments of disruption to correct themselves and improve. But, insofar as \u2018chaos\u2019 is the very opposite of \u2018order\u2019, the notion that we should accommodate ourselves to periodic bouts of chaos as part of a natural \u2018dynamic relationship\u2019 seems to me fatalistic and desperate\u2014especially when \u2018chaos\u2019 connotes for me the lawless tyranny of brutal warlords (or revolutionaries) in a time of anarchy. And I cannot imagine that ancient Chinese peasants suffering under the heel of such anarchical tyranny during China\u2019s many bouts of bloody civil war were wont to accept it philosophically, unless driven to do so by utter despair. Certainly, the Hebrew authors of the creation myths in the Bible did not view chaos kindly, perhaps in the light of their own people\u2019s traumatic experience of Israel being conquered, Jerusalem sacked, ethnic cleansing, and compulsory exile in Babylon. Consequently, the God to whom they prayed was very definitely one who overcomes chaos and (re)orders the world.\n\nYeo\u2019s discussion of Confucian thought reminds me of my own study of it in relation to rights, which appeared my 2020 book, What\u2019s Wrong with Rights? There (on pages 212-15) I observed that, while the absence of rights-talk is a weakness in Confucian thought, the presence of virtue-talk is very much a strength. This is because, contrary to normal discussion in the contemporary West, rights-talk does not suffice. This is for two reasons. First, the existence of a legal right leaves wide open the moral question of how to use it well. For example, the law may grant me a right of free speech to spit on your sacred cow for the sheer fun of riling you, but the obligation of the virtue of charity forbids me to exercise it. And second, as I have said already, for my right to be effective (without having recourse to the courts), it needs you to possess the virtues that enable you to restrain yourself sufficiently to respect it. Therefore, the Confucian emphasis on virtue is something that Westerners would benefit from paying attention to. And if they were to do so, Western Christians might be reminded that their own tradition also has much more to say about virtues than about rights.\n\nIn his response, Stewart Gill discusses the constructive role that Christian institutions can play on the campuses of secular universities, and he reports the success of his own Centre for the Study of Science, Religion and Society in providing a forum at the University of Queensland for the self-restrained, respectful, virtuous discussion of \u201csubjects that were anathema to many \u2018mainstream\u2019 academics\u201d. I can only applaud that and say again and more loudly that I think that Christians have a very important, prophetic role to play in modelling the Christian virtues necessary to enable careful, give-and-take, rational discussion of incendiary issues at a time when too many academics and students are frozen in the headlights of the aggressively illiberal expression of \u2018progressive\u2019 views of gender, race, and colonial history. I think it no accident that here in the UK, Christians have often been at the forefront of efforts to defend free (and respectful) speech. And I find it a delicious and satisfying irony that we people of faith have turned out to be the champions of rationality and liberality. Of course, for those who appreciate the Christian view of the human condition, it is no irony at all.\n\nAn important part of defending rationality and the respectful, liberal engagement of different points of view involves taking the war to the enemy. And among the main enemies are certain reaches of postmodern philosophy, which Denis Alexander discusses in his response from the point of view of the natural sciences.\n\nWhile postmodernists are right to be sceptical about many aspects of the modernist \u2018Grand Narrative\u2019\u2014for example, its faith in a narrow conception of reason, in science, and in inevitable progress\u2014they are wrong to imply that all narratives are equal and that there is no rational way of telling between them. I remember a panel discussion about empire in Oxford some years ago. At one point I turned to a fellow-panelist, a professor of international relations, and observed that she had made two assertions whose logical consistency was not obvious to me. \u201cEnough of your donnish, tutorial tactics!\u201d, she declared imperiously, sweeping my rational objection off the table. At first, I was stunned. But when I had gathered my thoughts together, I asked myself, \u201cDoes this dialogue have any rules? If not, what on earth is the point of it? Indeed, if not, is it really a dialogue at all?\u201d.\n\nFurther, while postmodernists are right to alert us to the ways in which dominant narratives and their means of construction can be the tools of power, they are wrong to obscure the fact that they object to \u2018power\u2019 only because they assume it to be unjust, and in that assumption they are making a claim about what is morally true. In other words, insofar as they expect their claim to have moral authority over anyone else, they are in fact appealing to an objective, transcendent moral order. And for that , they need to be held to account.\n\nFurther still, postmodernists are also wrong to overlook the fact that their critique of prevailing \u2018power\u2019 is itself a bid for power that can be abused\u2014and, judging by the unscrupulous behaviour of many \u2018woke\u2019 academics, it often is abused. In brief, Christians need to remind postmodernists that they are sinners, too.\n\nTo a theologian, it is obvious that Christian colleagues working in non-theological disciplines ought to reflect on how their Christian beliefs should shape the way they think about their disciplinary matter. No doubt, most Christian colleagues do not need persuading of that. However, time is short and most academic theology does not lend itself to ready use by non-specialists. Like every academic discipline, it has developed a language of its own, which provides insiders with an efficient shorthand they all understand\u2014otherwise known as \u2018jargon\u2019. Think \u2018kenotic Christology\u2019 or \u2018realised eschatology\u2019 or the \u2018kairotic moment\u2019. It does not necessarily intend to blind outsiders with esoteric science, but that is often its effect. Hence, the importance of the mission of the Global Faculty Initiative, namely, to get theologians to think about how to communicate relevant facets of theology to academic colleagues in a fashion that is readily intelligible.\n\nSo far, perhaps, so condescending. For the traffic is not just one way\u2014from the enlightened theologian to poor, benighted Christians in law, biology, music, etc. The theologian has a lot of things to learn, too. As a moral theologian (or Christian ethicist), who deals in questions of good and bad, right and wrong, I am more inclined to be sensitive to that than, say, systematic or philosophical theologians, because I cannot begin to apply moral principles appropriately, without first having reached some understanding of the matter I want to apply them to. If I want to apply them to the practice of medicine, I need to know what that practice is. If I want to apply them to the practice of war, I need to acquire an appreciation of military affairs. If I want to apply them to social and political issues, I need first to learn from social and political scientists.\n\nBut, actually, the word \u2018apply\u2019 is not quite right. For, what is going on here is not the simple \u2018application\u2019 of a ready-made, complete moral concept to inert matter. Sometimes, the matter talks back. Sometimes, the moral concept learns from the encounter and adapts. What is actually going on is more a dialogue than an application\u2014more dialectical than monological.\n\nHere is an example. In September 1998 I ran a conference in Oxford under the title, \u201cBurying the Past: Making Peace and Doing Justice after Civil Conflict\u201d. I did so because I had been working on theories of the Atonement and issues of forgiveness and reconciliation. The topic was also highly topical because the Good Friday Agreement had been signed the previous April, ending thirty years of intermittent bloodshed in Northern Ireland. And the Truth and Reconciliation Commission (TRC) in South Africa was about to deliver its report the following month. Among the two hundred people present at our conference were a number of Christian theologians. For us, talk about \u2018reconciliation\u2019 was second nature. We all assumed that it was appropriate to deploy the idea straightforwardly in relation to the aftermath of civil strife. However, after one presentation up stood Ulrike Poppe, a Lutheran deacon who had been twice imprisoned by the communist authorities in East Germany for her dissident activity. \u201cWhat\u2019s all this talk of \u2018reconciliation\u2019? I live on the same street as the man who informed on me to the Stasi. I didn\u2019t know him before, and I certainly don\u2019t want to know him now! \u2018Reconciliation\u2019? What do you mean?\u201d Poppe\u2019s startling intervention was a moment of revelation. It sparked a train of thought that also took into account reports I had read of criticism of Archbishop Desmond Tutu for urging the too-quick forgiveness of murderers by the relatives of their victims during public hearings of the TRC. The conclusion I drew from all this is that talk of \u2018forgiveness\u2019 and \u2018reconciliation\u2019 is most at home in intimate relationships of family and friends. Their paradigm is depicted in Rembrandt\u2019s famous paintings of the gladly forgiving Father embracing his Prodigal Son. However, when we move from the domestic sphere of intimate relationships to the political one of relationships between strangers, the meanings of \u2018forgiveness\u2019 and \u2018reconciliation\u2019 become attenuated. It really was not appropriate for us to have implied that Ulrike Poppe should have embraced her Stasi informer on the street. In her case, it would have been more appropriate to expect \u2018co-existence\u2019 or \u2018accommodation\u2019 rather than \u2018reconciliation\u2019.\n\nIf that sounds just too anaemic a concession, consider this. About ten years later, partly inspired by things I had learned in 1998, I ran another conference under the provocative title, \u201cIs Forgiveness Immoral?\u201d. During the proceedings a Danish philosopher showed us a photograph taken at a gacaca trial in Rwanda after the 1994 genocide. In this photo, a tall man stands next to a short man. One of them murdered the other\u2019s relative. The bad news is that they cannot look each other in the eye. The good news is that they are standing close to each other. That picture confirmed what I had begun to learn a decade before: that under the grim circumstances of the aftermath of civil war, \u2018co-existence\u2019 or \u2018accommodation\u2019 is no mean achievement.\n\nI say all of this simply to illustrate two occasions when I, as a theologian, found myself corrected by empirical data\u2014and on the second occasion that data was delivered to me by a colleague in another academic discipline. So, the traffic between theologians and their Christian brothers and sisters in other disciplines is by no means merely one-way. We all learn from what should be a genuine dialogue. We all need to learn\u2014non-theologians to think more Christianly, and theologians to think more realistically.\n\nNigel Biggar, Behaving in Public: How to do Christian Ethics (Eerdmans, 2011)\n\n________, \u201cA Case for Casuistry in the Church\u201d, Modern Theology , 6/1 (October 1989)\n\n________, \u201cLess Hegel, More History: Christian Ethics and Political Realities\u201d, Providence , 18 May 2016\n\n________, \u201c Religion\u2019s place at the table of \u2018secular\u2019 medical ethics: a response to the commentaries\u201d, Journal of Medical Ethics , 41/11 (November 2015)\n\n________, \u201cWhy Religion Deserves a Place in Secular Medicine\u201d, Journal of Medical Ethics , 41/3 (March 2015)",
    "bodyHtml": "<p>I anticipated that some readers would react to my \u2018conservative\u2019 choice of topic and affirmation of the good of order. I am aware that my position is one I take in reaction against the prevailing <em>Zeitgeist</em>, certainly in Western universities, which finds its inspiration in the social, cultural, and political rebellion of the 1960s. I can imagine other circumstances where I would put my weight on the other foot and talk up more loudly the virtues of disorder. But we are here, not there.</p>\n<p>Of the several colleagues who do talk up the value of disorder the first is David Mahan. Specifically, he recommends the virtue of <em>contemplating </em>the disorder of sin and, in particular, <em>appreciating</em> the difficulty that the victims of trauma often have in seeing moral order at all and believing in it. I take his point. I quite agree that bluntly asserting such order to such people would be pastorally stupid. It would also be unpersuasive. Evidently, there is a lot of moral disorder in the world, some of it horrific, and belief that it is not basic and will not triumph ultimately requires an act of faith.</p>\n<p>Nevertheless, the empirical phenomena are ambiguous: there is good in the world as well as evil, or\u2014as Terence Malick\u2019s extraordinary 1998 film, <em>The Thin Red Line</em>, puts it\u2014glory as well as horror. And human beings who suffer injustice do have deeply implanted within them\u2014for a reason that begs explanation\u2014the conviction that things <em>should</em> be different. And hope that they <em>will</em> be different can in fact survive the most dreadful experiences. If I remember correctly, that was the gist of Viktor Frankel\u2019s 1946 book, <em>Man\u2019s Search for Meaning</em>, which observed that different Holocaust survivors reacted to their common experience in different ways. Not all were driven to despair and suicide; some had their faith and hope restored. Still, words alone will not suffice to save. That will require the powerful beauty of personal incarnations of moral order.</p>\n<h2>What is the Source of Moral Obligations?</h2>\n<p>In my essay I say that the moral dimension of the created order of the world comprises, at base, human goods or aspects of human flourishing. At one point I also say that \u201cbasic human goods generate natural law\u201d. In asserting this, I implicitly reject the view that moral obligations are created by divine commands, because I object to the idea that morality is based on inscrutable, arbitrary divine <em>fiats </em>and to the allied picture of God as a despot who obliges something <em>for no other reason</em> than that he fancies it. Instead, it seems to me that the intrinsic worth of human goods, their beauty, their attractive power are quite sufficient to ground moral obligations. We ought to do something, because it will promote an intrinsically valuable good; we ought not to do something, because it will harm such a good. In brief, the law exists to serve human flourishing. Surely, no orthodox, Pauline Christian can think otherwise. Law is not its own justification. It is not the first and last word. It is not the point. For, as Jesus himself famously put it, \u201cThe Sabbath was made for Man, not Man for the Sabbath\u201d (Mark 2.27, KJV).</p>\n<p>About divine commands, Nicholas Wolterstorff agrees with me. However, he argues that human goods alone do not generate moral obligations, for some ways of promoting goods are not obligatory, and some ways of diminishing goods are not wrongful. So, in order to determine what is and is not obligatory, we need something beyond the goods themselves. We need, Wolterstorff argues, human dignity or \u201cthe worth of persons\u201d.</p>\n<p>I agree that goods alone do not determine obligations. Human dignity, however, seems to me a concept too vague to be helpful. I prefer a more definite alternative along the following lines. While talk simply of \u2018human goods\u2019 is succinct, it is too abstract to be sufficient. Rather, we should talk at greater length and more concretely of \u2018aspects of the common human flourishing of a human individual\u2019. No individual human being flourishes in quite the same way. Each individual develops some aspects of flourishing less, more, and differently than others\u2014contingent upon external circumstances, inner talent, and God\u2019s calling. Note that what commands our care, whether in promotion or defence, are still human goods, albeit as they are uniquely instantiated in a particular person.</p>\n<p>Further, the reason that we are not always obliged to promote every human good is that we cannot. We lack sufficient resources of time and power to do so. That is why universal positive obligations are general, not specific. We are always obliged to love our neighbours in some fashion, but we are not always obliged to preserve their physical lives by feeding them, because sometimes we lack food ourselves.</p>\n<p>And we are not always obliged not to diminish a human good, because sometimes we find ourselves placed in tragic circumstances where we cannot defend the good of an innocent neighbour without damaging the good of the neighbour who is oppressing him. Whether or not it is right to damage the latter\u2019s good depends on three things. First, that there is an overriding duty to defend the innocent. Second, that the damage is unintended (that is, an unavoidable side effect of defending the innocent). And third, that it is proportionate (that is, no more than necessary to achieve the good, intended end).</p>\n<p>So, I agree with Wolterstorff that the goods alone don\u2019t suffice to determine what is and is not obligatory. But I still think that it is the intrinsic value of human goods, uniquely instantiated in particular individuals, that generates such obligations as we have, even if other factors are required to determine what obligations obtain in particular circumstances.</p>\n<h2>Revolutionary versus Organic Change in Social and Political Orders</h2>\n<p>A second advocate of the value of disorder is Alan Bell, who asserts that \u201ctoo much emphasis on order ... runs the risk of leading to an alignment of Christianity with sociopolitical conservatism\u201d, and that \u201cJesus\u2019 mission had a strong strand of disordering built into it\u201d. Moreover, Bell suggests that my view of social hierarchy comes perilously close to rehearsing 19<sup>th</sup> century anti-abolitionist arguments that \u201cslavery is fine as long as owners are nice to their slaves\u201d.</p>\n<p>Of course, I agree that there is such a thing as an excessive emphasis on order. I think that I was careful in my essay to distinguish between the divine moral order and human legal and political orders, and to make clear that the latter are subject to potentially disturbing judgement by the former. Surely, no follower of Jesus could suppose otherwise.</p>\n<p>On the other hand, I do not read Jesus as an advocate of revolutionary politics in the modern sense of forced regime-change followed by state-sponsored, top-down social and economic reform. That option was open to him in the form of nationalist, Zealot opposition to foreign, imperial rule and he rejected it (John 6.15). And while he was fiercely critical of Jewish religious elites, he refused to be drawn into condemning Caesar\u2014\u201cGive to Caesar what is Caesar\u2019s \u2026\u201d (Mark 12.17)\u2014and commended one Roman (auxiliary) centurion as a paragon of faith (Matthew 8.5-10, 13). The kind of revolution that Jesus called for was organic, gradual, bottom-up\u2014as indicated by his use of the metaphors of yeast (or leaven) and mustard seed to describe the growth of God\u2019s kingdom (Matthew 13.31-33). His model of social, economic, and political change was closer to that of Edmund Burke than those of Robespierre or Lenin. And, at least in relation to the French Revolution, Burke is usually considered to be a conservative.</p>\n<p>Moreover, I do think that there are important truths that the alignment of Christianity with sociopolitical radicalism\u2014which is usual, in my experience, among academic colleagues\u2014obscures important truths. Moreover, it runs <em>with</em>\u2014<em>not against</em>\u2014the flow of the \u2018progressive\u2019 <em>Zeitgeist</em> that now prevails in universities and therefore among cultural elites. That, in itself, does not make it wrong. But it ought to make it <em>prima facie</em> suspect among those who, following Jesus, should expect the Word of God to appear from left field. Therefore, to talk up important truths that regnant sociopolitical radicalism tends to overlook or downplay is, at this time and in this place, prophetic.</p>\n<p>As for slavery, I do not think that a careful reader will infer that I think that it is okay so long as slave-owners treat slaves \u2018nicely\u2019. What I said was that functional hierarchies in which functional superiors treat functional inferiors \u201cfraternally\u201d are unobjectionable. Thereby, I alluded to Paul\u2019s injunction to Philemon to receive back his runaway slave, Onesimus, as \u201ca beloved brother\u201d (Philemon 1.15-16). When masters treat slaves \u2018fraternally\u2019\u2014not just \u2018nicely\u2019\u2014they treat them as, in a certain sense, equals. And in that case the institution of slavery, wherein the slave is the master\u2019s disposable property, cannot long survive. Note that for Paul, as for Jesus, the model of social change is organic, occurring from the inside outward.</p>\n<h2>The Intelligibility of the Universe and Human Moral Order</h2>\n<p>I share Javier S\u00e1nchez-Ca\u00f1izarez\u2019s interest in the question of the connection between belief in natural law\u2014or, better, natural moral order\u2014and belief in (the biblical) God. It is clear that the latter entails belief in the former: to believe in the one God who created the world out of chaos entails belief that the created world bears the marks of that God\u2019s moral coherence. It is not so clear, however, that the entailment works the other way around: that those who believe in a natural moral order are bound to believe in God\u2014or as S\u00e1nchez-Ca\u00f1izarez puts it, that \u201cintelligibility of the universe drives towards the acceptance of a personal Creator\u201d.</p>\n<p>And yet, it does seem to me that a vision of the universe as basically impersonal, blind, and heartless is naturally allied to a view of the human condition as basically amoral. It chimes with the Hobbesian view that, until human beings happen to make contracts or conventions or laws that promote their fundamental common interest in avoiding pain and death, there simply are no morality or justice. The idea that a heartless universe would throw up intrinsically valuable goods\u2014especially non-material, spiritual ones such as knowledge of the truth (regardless of its utility) and appreciation of sheer beauty\u2014seems most odd.</p>\n<h2>Moral Order and Adaptive Change in Legal and Social Orders</h2>\n<p>Terry Halliday is another who talks up the value of disorder, when he writes that \u201c<em>a vibrant social or legal order requires constant disturbance as a dynamic of adaptation</em>\u201d. (The emphatic italics are his.) I agree with the basic point, namely, that all humanly created social or legal orders, being finite, fallible, and sinful, deserve to be disturbed into new and better forms. I would add the conservative qualification, however, that human flourishing is not compatible with <em>constant</em> social, legal, or political disturbance, if by that is meant permanent revolution. Human flourishing normally requires a social context that is considerably stable, predictable, and reliable. That, I take it, is why, in the 1950s and \u201860s, several million Chinese chose to flee the warn-torn and anarchic mainland of China for the British colony of Hong Kong, which, while not democratic, at least offered the considerable social benefit of the rule of law. Only when a political \u2018order\u2019 keeps the peace by means of arbitrary state-terror might human flourishing best be served by incurring the risks and hazards of political revolution.</p>\n<p>Halliday quite reasonably asks to see how, specifically, the created moral order bears critically upon social and legal orders. That would require the articulation of an account of human flourishing and its constituent goods, and of a set of moral principles and rules in the light of those goods and of human finitude, fallibility, and sinfulness. These rules would then have to be brought into dialogue with the particular social or legal matters under consideration. I say \u2018dialogue\u2019, because the content of moral rules is often refined and determined by the nature of the matter to which they are being applied. The matter sometimes talks back to the rules, which learn and adapt to it. It is not always passively subject to them. For that reason, the task of bringing the moral order to bear upon social and legal orders ought to be interdisciplinary, involving both Christian ethicists on the one hand, and social and political scientists on the other.</p>\n<p>Of course, human understanding of what the created moral order actually is, what its principles and rules are, and how it bears upon fields of human conduct is itself bound to be finite, fallible, and sinful. It will take various forms, relatively conflicting. The variety of vying Christian traditions of ethical reflection over two millennia bears ample witness to that. We cannot escape the cognitive limits of our human condition. All we can do is to put our best foot forward, absorb and sift the criticism conscientiously, adjust our direction accordingly, and keep on walking. After all, while we may be Christians, we remain sinful creatures, not gods.</p>\n<h2>Christian Virtue and Civility in Academic Discourse and Public Debate</h2>\n<p>My Oxford colleague, J\u00f6rg Friedrichs, tells a candid and moving story about how demanding the exercise of Christian virtues in the context of academic controversy can be. I stand and salute him! All I would add is to say that the manner in which Christian academics argue is quite as important, perhaps even more so, than the content of what they have to say.</p>\n<p>My own experience of the \u2018culture war\u2019 over colonial history, since I was first dragged into it in December 2017, has revealed a shocking degree of aggressiveness, intemperance, and dishonesty on the part of some academic colleagues that I imagined to exist. I have learned that some abuse is best simply absorbed, that not everyone who addresses one deserves a response, that some want a no-holds-barred fight rather than a conversation, and that maintaining one\u2019s dignity and staying doggedly (even if sharply) reasonable is important above all else. It may not impress (at least in the short term) the colleague who is shouting in your face, but it may well impress the dozens or hundreds or (online) thousands who are watching.</p>\n<p>I am convinced that in the current climate, Christians, believing as we do in our common subjection to the Truth and feeling obliged by the virtues required to approximate it more closely, have a very important, prophetic role to play in keeping campus controversy civil, showing students how to handle it well, and thereby populating society with graduate citizens trained to so restrain themselves as to be capable of respecting the right of others to speak freely. Legal rights require a virtuous citizenry to have effect.</p>\n<h2><strong>What Confucian Virtue-Talk brings to the Christian Tradition</strong></h2>\n<p>In his cross-cultural comparison, K. K. Yeo tells us that in Confucian thought order does not overcome chaos but co-exists with it in \u201ca dynamic relationship\u201d. It is not quite clear what Yeo himself thinks of this idea, but it strikes me as odd. I can understand it as a description of an experience of history as an unavoidable cycle of order and chaos. I can also make sense of it, if I substitute the word \u2018disorder\u2019 for \u2018chaos\u2019 and understand it along the lines that several respondents have already asserted\u2014that finite, fallible, and fallen human orders invariably need moments of disruption to correct themselves and improve. But, insofar as \u2018chaos\u2019 is the very opposite of \u2018order\u2019, the notion that we should accommodate ourselves to periodic bouts of chaos as part of a natural \u2018dynamic relationship\u2019 seems to me fatalistic and desperate\u2014especially when \u2018chaos\u2019 connotes for me the lawless tyranny of brutal warlords (or revolutionaries) in a time of anarchy. And I cannot imagine that ancient Chinese peasants suffering under the heel of such anarchical tyranny during China\u2019s many bouts of bloody civil war were wont to accept it philosophically, unless driven to do so by utter despair. Certainly, the Hebrew authors of the creation myths in the Bible did not view chaos kindly, perhaps in the light of their own people\u2019s traumatic experience of Israel being conquered, Jerusalem sacked, ethnic cleansing, and compulsory exile in Babylon. Consequently, the God to whom they prayed was very definitely one who overcomes chaos and (re)orders the world.</p>\n<p>Yeo\u2019s discussion of Confucian thought reminds me of my own study of it in relation to rights, which appeared my 2020 book, <em>What\u2019s Wrong with Rights?</em> There (on pages 212-15) I observed that, while the absence of rights-talk is a weakness in Confucian thought, the presence of virtue-talk is very much a strength. This is because, contrary to normal discussion in the contemporary West, rights-talk does not suffice. This is for two reasons. First, the existence of a legal right leaves wide open the moral question of how to use it well. For example, the law may grant me a right of free speech to spit on your sacred cow for the sheer fun of riling you, but the obligation of the virtue of charity forbids me to exercise it. And second, as I have said already, for my right to be effective (without having recourse to the courts), it needs you to possess the virtues that enable you to restrain yourself sufficiently to respect it. Therefore, the Confucian emphasis on virtue is something that Westerners would benefit from paying attention to. And if they were to do so, Western Christians might be reminded that their own tradition also has much more to say about virtues than about rights.</p>\n<h2>A Prophetic Role for Christians in Secular Universities</h2>\n<p>In his response, Stewart Gill discusses the constructive role that Christian institutions can play on the campuses of secular universities, and he reports the success of his own Centre for the Study of Science, Religion and Society in providing a forum at the University of Queensland for the self-restrained, respectful, virtuous discussion of \u201csubjects that were anathema to many \u2018mainstream\u2019 academics\u201d. I can only applaud that and say again and more loudly that I think that Christians have a very important, prophetic role to play in modelling the Christian virtues necessary to enable careful, give-and-take, rational discussion of incendiary issues at a time when too many academics and students are frozen in the headlights of the aggressively illiberal expression of \u2018progressive\u2019 views of gender, race, and colonial history. I think it no accident that here in the UK, Christians have often been at the forefront of efforts to defend free (and respectful) speech. And I find it a delicious and satisfying irony that we people of faith have turned out to be the champions of rationality and liberality. Of course, for those who appreciate the Christian view of the human condition, it is no irony at all.</p>\n<h2>Rights, Wrongs and Post-Modernists</h2>\n<p>An important part of defending rationality and the respectful, liberal engagement of different points of view involves taking the war to the enemy. And among the main enemies are certain reaches of postmodern philosophy, which Denis Alexander discusses in his response from the point of view of the natural sciences.</p>\n<p>While postmodernists are right to be sceptical about many aspects of the modernist \u2018Grand Narrative\u2019\u2014for example, its faith in a narrow conception of reason, in science, and in inevitable progress\u2014they are wrong to imply that all narratives are equal and that there is no rational way of telling between them. I remember a panel discussion about empire in Oxford some years ago. At one point I turned to a fellow-panelist, a professor of international relations, and observed that she had made two assertions whose logical consistency was not obvious to me. \u201cEnough of your donnish, tutorial tactics!\u201d, she declared imperiously, sweeping my rational objection off the table. At first, I was stunned. But when I had gathered my thoughts together, I asked myself, \u201cDoes this dialogue have any rules? If not, what on earth is the point of it? Indeed, if not, is it really a dialogue at all?\u201d.</p>\n<p>Further, while postmodernists are right to alert us to the ways in which dominant narratives and their means of construction can be the tools of power, they are wrong to obscure the fact that they object to \u2018power\u2019 only because they assume it to be unjust, and in that assumption they are making a claim about what is morally true. In other words, insofar as they expect their claim to have moral authority over anyone else, they are in fact appealing to an objective, transcendent moral order. And for that , they need to be held to account.</p>\n<p>Further still, postmodernists are also wrong to overlook the fact that their critique of prevailing \u2018power\u2019 is itself a bid for power that can be abused\u2014and, judging by the unscrupulous behaviour of many \u2018woke\u2019 academics, it often is abused. In brief, Christians need to remind postmodernists that they are sinners, too.</p>\n<h2>The Need for Interdisciplinary Dialogue among Christians</h2>\n<p>To a theologian, it is obvious that Christian colleagues working in non-theological disciplines ought to reflect on how their Christian beliefs should shape the way they think about their disciplinary matter. No doubt, most Christian colleagues do not need persuading of that. However, time is short and most academic theology does not lend itself to ready use by non-specialists. Like every academic discipline, it has developed a language of its own, which provides insiders with an efficient shorthand they all understand\u2014otherwise known as \u2018jargon\u2019. Think \u2018kenotic Christology\u2019 or \u2018realised eschatology\u2019 or the \u2018kairotic moment\u2019. It does not necessarily intend to blind outsiders with esoteric science, but that is often its effect. Hence, the importance of the mission of the Global Faculty Initiative, namely, to get theologians to <em>think</em> about how to communicate relevant facets of theology to academic colleagues in a fashion that is readily intelligible.</p>\n<p>So far, perhaps, so condescending. For the traffic is not just one way\u2014from the enlightened theologian to poor, benighted Christians in law, biology, music, etc. The theologian has a lot of things to learn, too. As a <em>moral</em> theologian (or Christian ethicist), who deals in questions of good and bad, right and wrong, I am more inclined to be sensitive to that than, say, systematic or philosophical theologians, because I cannot begin to apply moral principles appropriately, without first having reached some understanding of the matter I want to apply them to. If I want to apply them to the practice of medicine, I need to know what that practice is. If I want to apply them to the practice of war, I need to acquire an appreciation of military affairs. If I want to apply them to social and political issues, I need first to learn from social and political scientists.</p>\n<p>But, actually, the word \u2018apply\u2019 is not quite right. For, what is going on here is not the simple \u2018application\u2019 of a ready-made, complete moral concept to inert matter. Sometimes, the matter talks back. Sometimes, the moral concept learns from the encounter and adapts. What is actually going on is more a dialogue than an application\u2014more dialectical than monological.</p>\n<p>Here is an example. In September 1998 I ran a conference in Oxford under the title, \u201cBurying the Past: Making Peace and Doing Justice after Civil Conflict\u201d. I did so because I had been working on theories of the Atonement and issues of forgiveness and reconciliation. The topic was also highly topical because the Good Friday Agreement had been signed the previous April, ending thirty years of intermittent bloodshed in Northern Ireland. And the Truth and Reconciliation Commission (TRC) in South Africa was about to deliver its report the following month. Among the two hundred people present at our conference were a number of Christian theologians. For us, talk about \u2018reconciliation\u2019 was second nature. We all assumed that it was appropriate to deploy the idea straightforwardly in relation to the aftermath of civil strife. However, after one presentation up stood Ulrike Poppe, a Lutheran deacon who had been twice imprisoned by the communist authorities in East Germany for her dissident activity. \u201cWhat\u2019s all this talk of \u2018reconciliation\u2019? I live on the same street as the man who informed on me to the Stasi. I didn\u2019t know him before, and I certainly don\u2019t want to know him now! \u2018Reconciliation\u2019? What do you mean?\u201d Poppe\u2019s startling intervention was a moment of revelation. It sparked a train of thought that also took into account reports I had read of criticism of Archbishop Desmond Tutu for urging the too-quick forgiveness of murderers by the relatives of their victims during public hearings of the TRC. The conclusion I drew from all this is that talk of \u2018forgiveness\u2019 and \u2018reconciliation\u2019 is most at home in intimate relationships of family and friends. Their paradigm is depicted in Rembrandt\u2019s famous paintings of the gladly forgiving Father embracing his Prodigal Son. However, when we move from the domestic sphere of intimate relationships to the political one of relationships between strangers, the meanings of \u2018forgiveness\u2019 and \u2018reconciliation\u2019 become attenuated. It really was not appropriate for us to have implied that Ulrike Poppe should have embraced her Stasi informer on the street. In her case, it would have been more appropriate to expect \u2018co-existence\u2019 or \u2018accommodation\u2019 rather than \u2018reconciliation\u2019.</p>\n<p>If that sounds just too anaemic a concession, consider this. About ten years later, partly inspired by things I had learned in 1998, I ran another conference under the provocative title, \u201cIs Forgiveness Immoral?\u201d. During the proceedings a Danish philosopher showed us a photograph taken at a <em>gacaca</em> trial in Rwanda after the 1994 genocide. In this photo, a tall man stands next to a short man. One of them murdered the other\u2019s relative. The bad news is that they cannot look each other in the eye. The good news is that they are standing close to each other. That picture confirmed what I had begun to learn a decade before: that under the grim circumstances of the aftermath of civil war, \u2018co-existence\u2019 or \u2018accommodation\u2019 is no mean achievement.</p>\n<p>I say all of this simply to illustrate two occasions when I, as a theologian, found myself corrected by empirical data\u2014and on the second occasion that data was delivered to me by a colleague in another academic discipline. So, the traffic between theologians and their Christian brothers and sisters in other disciplines is by no means merely one-way. We all learn from what should be a genuine dialogue. We all <em>need</em> to learn\u2014non-theologians to think more Christianly, and theologians to think more realistically.</p>\n<h2 class=\"new_page\">Further Reading</h2>\n<p>Nigel Biggar, <em>Behaving in Public: How to do Christian Ethics</em> (Eerdmans, 2011)</p>\n<p>________, \u201cA Case for Casuistry in the Church\u201d, <em>Modern Theology</em>, 6/1 (October 1989)</p>\n<p>________, \u201cLess Hegel, More History: Christian Ethics and Political Realities\u201d, <em>Providence</em>, 18 May 2016</p>\n<p>________, \u201c<a href=\"https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/26405012/\">Religion\u2019s place at the table of \u2018secular\u2019 medical ethics: a response to the commentaries\u201d, <em>Journal of Medical Ethics</em>, </a>41/11 (November 2015)</p>\n<p>________, \u201cWhy Religion Deserves a Place in Secular Medicine\u201d, <em>Journal of Medical Ethics</em>, 41/3 (March 2015)</p>"

    "bodyText": "Nigel Biggar (2022) argues that there is a created order in the world, but then humans, due to their sinful nature, have degraded and distorted that order.\n\nIn our work on Artificial Intelligence (AI), we also believe that there exists a created natural order, which we can observe through analysis of different datasets, this may include image datasets, text datasets, audio datasets, etc. An AI model is trained using a collected dataset as input. For example, we may use a dataset containing 10,000 photos of animals as input, with each photo labelled with the identity of the animal, to train an AI model so it will be able to determine the animal shown in a photo. One popular AI model is the feed-forward neural network (NN). It consists of multiple layers, each consisting of nodes or neurons, with the input images (the input layer) feeding the lowest/first layer of the NN, which is connected to the second layer, then the third layer, etc., until the top layer, which is connected to the output layer (the label of the input image). The neurons of each layer are connected to the neurons of the next higher layer with edges, each assigned a weight/parameter. An input image, coded as the intensity of the pixels of the photo, is multiplied by the weights as it goes up the layers, eventually reaching the output layer. Obviously, we want an input image of a cat to eventually produce the output label of a cat, rather than another animal. The goal of training is to adjust the parameters so that they fit the majority of input images. Once the model is trained, i.e., the parameters have been optimized, one can give the model a new image, outside of the original images used in the training, and ask the model to determine which animal it is. We note that there is hierarchical structural order in this NN. The first layer determines the edges in the image. The second layer determines corners, or intersection of edges, and as we go up hierarchies, the layers identify increasingly complex structures in the image, such as the face of the animal, the eyes, etc.\n\nWhile we believe that there is an emergent, created order in the natural world, our observations via data collection and the hierarchical AI techniques may not be able to give us a true or comprehensive representation of this emergent order [\u00a01\u00a0] [\u00a02\u00a0] . Whatever AI models, hierarchical or non-hierarchical alike, the accuracy is dependent on the quality of the dataset used for model training. If the original 10,000 photos are those of dogs and cats, and one presents the AI model a photo of an elephant, it will not be able to determine that it is an elephant. Even if we increase the number of photos to one million in the dataset, and include many more different animals, we may never be able to include all the animals in the world, as there may be certain rare animals for which a photo is unavailable for training or, due to the modern view of the genetic \u2018tree of life\u2019 (which swept away Platonic and Aristotelian ideas of \u2018form\u2019), there may be animals which very closely resemble each other. Furthermore, the photos may be blurry, and the model trained with such photos will not be accurate.\n\nHow can AI facilitate the type of \u201corder\u201d and \u201cgoods\u201d that God destines human beings to uphold?\n\nAs implied by Biggar, \u201cthe order which \u2026 God impresses on the created world is not merely physical, but also value-laden\u201d, \u201cthe co-originality of matter and value\u201d implies that humans care about a range of goods not just material ones, \u201cimmaterial goods such as moral integrity, the virtue of charity, and relations of justice can be very powerful motives\u201d. We fully share Biggar\u2019s view concerning the value-laden nature of God\u2019s created order. It is therefore our desire to encourage academics to appreciate such values or immaterial goods, as we embed such values into our discipline of AI for Social Good.\n\nWhile engineers and natural scientists typically work on programmes that strive to help humanity flourish by means of material prosperity, such as, developing sustainable energy systems, creating smart cities, etc., social scientists are keen on investigating non-material goods, such as mental wellness, family relationships and social welfare. Many of these objectives are constrained by a humanistic perspective, failing to appreciate the goods that originate from the Creator. Biggar (2022) is inclined to associate \u201cgoods\u201d with things that are \u201cdesirable\u201d, which also implies the objective of \u201chuman flourishing\u201d. So, our question becomes, what type of \u201cgoods\u201d does the Creator of \u201corder\u201d and \u201cgoods\u201d want to achieve via AI for Social Good?\n\nAlong this line, below are some questions that a Christian-infused AI for Social Good should address:\n\nWhile AI is designed by human beings, most of the time an NN is a black box which runs automatically without human intervention. Does this mean that AI can automatically operate without human input/guidance? If so, can an NN better reflect the \u201corder\u201d of the created system? Can the results generated by a self-governing NN be free from any human bias or subjectivity, and generate significance and meaning for humanity/society? Thinking about this differently: if there are divinely created orders that operate at an emergent level within the world, can self-governing AI make these visible? Put in Biggar\u2019s terms, can AI create value-driven prosperity, fostering human flourishing, drawing people to better understand the good and perfect order of our Creator, with a stronger reflection on truths underlying natural orders?\n\nTake the specific example of using AI to screen existing drugs for their suitability in early treatment of Alzheimer\u2019s Disease (AD) to prevent its symptomatic development. This ideally requires a large number of datasets of known drugs and drug-drug interactions, complete human reactome data incorporating both protein-protein interactions, drug-target associations, and the relative involvement of each pathological pathway in AD. Recent development of tools such as AlphaFold [\u00a03\u00a0] , which opens the prospect of predicting protein structure from genetic data, and innovative drug-target prediction methods [\u00a04\u00a0] , provide potential directions to remove human bias in data selection.\n\nTake another example of AD biomarker identification. Whilst big datasets may help mitigate human bias, due to the enormous number of interactions and the volume of data that would result from NN incorporating such big data, considerable human biases remain when only a small sample of selected data are inputted to the NN. Additional biases can be introduced through human perception of pathogenesis of AD: the molecular mechanism of Alzheimer\u2019s Disease remains ambiguous, and debates linger over the relative contribution of \u03b2-amyloid plaques, Neuro-Fibrillary Tangles, the immune system, oxidation pathways, and somatic mutagenesis, etc. Exploitation of NN for screening biomarkers of AD thus requires big datasets covering a wide range of subjects and potential biomarkers, such as genes and proteins, linguistic markers, behavioural markers of AD, coupled with the latest scientific/expert knowledge concerning AD pathogenesis, as demonstrated in our expert-guided AI-driven framework, exploiting different and big AD-associated datasets to identify early biomarkers governing early AD onset. This, along with datasets consisting of many subjects used to screen potential genes/biomarkers associated with AD, provide the probability of a particular gene/biomarker\u2019s contribution to AD.\n\nTo better reflect the created natural order, NN should be built with a capacity to remove possible human biases, while at the same time ready to incorporate human knowledge which reflects the more objective scientific/natural order. The wisdom of determining when human inputs are noises or valuable insights is an art rather than a science.\n\nAlong the line of Biggar\u2019s elaboration on \u201cgoods\u201d, what outcomes generated by AI are considered as biblically good/desirable? How can AI generate more goods than harms to humanity/society? How can we avoid harmful consequences of AI? Take our example of AI-driven treatment for AD, how can we make good use of the results generated from AI causal models to extend justice and healing on vulnerable dementia population, instead of generating wrong prediction of treatment leading to poor medical advice or judgement? By justice in the Alzheimer\u2019s context, we mean that each patient, with the advancement in AI-driven drug discovery and biomarker identification technologies, is given equal right to access to advanced AI-driven AD diagnostics and treatments, irrespective of one\u2019s race, age, and socio-economic background, etc.\n\nIf AI is meant for Social Good, along the lines of human flourishing, then it must be understood by the general public, and must address the needs of the society. Given that humans are created and non-omnipotent, humans are faulty instead of faultless, the AI system that humans create, even in cases when the system runs automatically, free of human control, would still be far from perfect. While the world is fascinated by what the AI and big data system can offer, it is important that we recognize both its potentials and limitations. For instance, while AI can help make estimation or prediction of the onset of a disease, such as AD, its results might still be subject to uncertainties, biases, and errors in input data and model design. Hence, an essential element of AI for Social Good should include a humble acknowledgment of (i) the limitations and flaws of AI, and (ii) the possible oversight of the orders/truths, virtues that Biggar (2022) affirmed in scholarship infused by God\u2019s moral order.\n\nHence, in future, AI for Social Good should aim to answer the theologically-driven questions above. The system we champion is guided by values derived from what is biblically desirable, such as building capacities for reasoning and interpretability, reducing biased decision-making, allowing humans to provide expert inputs and guide AI operations, and to take control of the system whenever life-critical decisions have to be made; aiming to meet the needs of our society, such as improving the quality of life and enhancing the ability of the public to make sense of results generated by AI models [\u00a05\u00a0] . It should also be able to build in itself a capacity to acknowledge limitations and partialities, or uncertainties that AI decisions will generate, leading us to acknowledge that we are simply human and we do not hold a complete picture of the ultimate truth and reality. In the following, we discuss the criteria in terms of AI methods, processes, and outcomes.\n\nAI for Social Good should allow users to comprehend and trust the outputs created by AI algorithms by adopting interpretable or explainable AI methodologies. Injecting reasoning and interpretability into AI algorithms is crucial for organizations and individuals to build trust and confidence in AI algorithms, by understanding how it works, what works best, and their limitations. This is consistent with Biggar\u2019s idea that the rationality of the creative order, as it applies to the natural order, must leave rooms for proper reasoning, for reflections on what are truths and non-truths, through repeated experiments and verifications [\u00a0A\u00a0] .\n\nAI for Social Good should develop AI algorithms and datasets to reduce biases. They can be designed with debiasing techniques that avoid creating unjust results, such as biases due to incomplete or small datasets, missing and noisy data, human-in-the-loop subject data, lack of expert guidance etc. [\u00a0B\u00a0] While biases are unavoidable due to human limitations and imperfections, attempts to remove biases are important as they imply that humans are constantly searching for the perfect natural order, but are yet attaining such perfection.\n\nAI for Social Good must account for the incentives and limitations of any human involvements in AI design, and provide appropriate opportunities for feedback, relevant explanations, and appeal. AI models should build a capacity to allow appropriate human direction and guidance whenever expert knowledge is critical to guide model operations and improve the quality of model outputs.\n\nAI for Social Good must process data in a secure fashion and fully respect the principles of human rights and privacy. There is a need for balancing the privacy of users while achieving greater social good via AI models. For instance, in order to improve the accuracy of AD biomarkers identification, AD subjects\u2019 data used for AI model training must be handled with care. While collecting and using such data for AI inputs can potentially benefit a large number of people suffering from AD, the rights and privacy of individual subjects providing clinical information must be safe-guarded.\n\nAI for Social Good must ensure that \u201cevery person involved in AI development must exercise caution by anticipating \u2026 the adverse consequences of Artificial Intelligent Systems use and by taking the appropriate measures to avoid them.\u201d [\u00a09\u00a0] . While it is still debatable whether a machine or an AI algorithm should be delegated with moral or ethical responsibility, namely, a \u201cmoral machine\u201d [\u00a010\u00a0] , it would be important for human beings to be able to take back the control of making moral or ethical decisions, in case of emergency.\n\nAI for Social Good projects must enhance the ability of public to understand and make sense of the results for their own decision-makings. As implied by Biggar, along with his idea on value-driven prosperity and human flourishing, what is considered as social good can only happen when the public are free to make decisions for their own good, and for the good of their own societies [\u00a0C\u00a0] .\n\nWe acknowledge the theological and biomedical inputs and critical reviews from Dr. Jocelyn Downey, part-time consultant of HKU-Cambridge AI to Advance Well-being and Society Research Platform ( https://www.eee.hku.hk/ai-wise/index.html ).\n\n[\u00a01\u00a0] Gulick, W.

They can be designed with debiasing techniques that avoid creating unjust results, such as biases due to incomplete or small datasets, missing and noisy data, human-in-the-loop subject data, lack of expert guidance etc.<a class=\"anchor\" id=\"content100note2anc\" name=\"content100note2anc\">\u00a0</a><a class=\"note\" href=\"#content100note2sym\">[\u00a0B\u00a0]</a> While biases are unavoidable due to human limitations and imperfections, attempts to remove biases are important as they imply that humans are constantly searching for the perfect natural order, but are yet attaining such perfection.</p>\n<h3>2. Processes</h3>\n<p>AI for Social Good must account for the incentives and limitations of any human involvements in AI design, and provide appropriate opportunities for feedback, relevant explanations, and appeal. AI models should build a capacity to allow appropriate human direction and guidance whenever expert knowledge is critical to guide model operations and improve the quality of model outputs.</p>\n<p>AI for Social Good must process data in a secure fashion and fully respect the principles of human rights and privacy. There is a need for balancing the privacy of users while achieving greater social good via AI models. For instance, in order to improve the accuracy of AD biomarkers identification, AD subjects\u2019 data used for AI model training must be handled with care. While collecting and using such data for AI inputs can potentially benefit a large number of people suffering from AD, the rights and privacy of individual subjects providing clinical information must be safe-guarded.</p>\n<h3>3. Outcomes</h3>\n<p>AI for Social Good must ensure that \u201cevery person involved in AI development must exercise caution by anticipating \u2026 the adverse consequences of Artificial Intelligent Systems use and by taking the appropriate measures to avoid them.\u201d <a class=\"anchor\" id=\"content100ref9anc\" name=\"content100ref9anc\">\u00a0</a><a class=\"note\" href=\"#content100ref9sym\">[\u00a09\u00a0]</a>.

    "bodyText": "My own perspective on this topic arises from my primary work at the intersection of literature and religion. This does not mean I am disinterested in the kind of broader philosophical and theological work Biggar undertakes in this \u2018brief\u2019 \u2013 indeed, the opposite is the case, including within my concentration. But I want to introduce a couple of thoughts that arise particularly from some of the literature I study and teach, which for the most part is work published in the 20 th and 21 st centuries.\n\nMy principal question is this: What is the value of contemplating dis -order , including for those who seek to live in light of what they believe is a divinely ordered world and set of principles and values?\n\nA recent article by University of Chicago philosopher Agnes Callard ( The Point , July 2022 [\u00a01\u00a0] ), argues that, as the title announces, \u201cArt is for seeing evil.\u201d Callard rejects notions of art and the aesthetic that focus on beauty and seeing the good. Instead, with an eye to narrative fiction in particular, she insists that art achieves something which subverts one of our most basic inclinations: to turn away from the ugly, to censor from our attention all of the harm, cruelty, injustice, catastrophe, degradation, etc., that humans suffer. Art, she argues, causes us to turn back to those realities. She writes, \u201cArt suspends our practical projects, releasing the prohibition against attending to the bad. Our ravenous consumption of badness in art reveals just how much we standardly deprive ourselves of it. We commonly praise some piece of art for its \u2018realism\u2019; we could fault life for its lack thereof.\u201d\n\nI reject Callard\u2019s reductionism\u2015art also can elevate and enchant. She is wrong, too, to insist that art is not for our moral edification, tied as it is to the very restrictive way she defines art and its supposed purposes. But she is right to point out the value of this other, and I would say equally edifying effect that art exercises: its ability to help us \u201cattend to the bad.\u201d Curiously, she compares that central purpose of seeing evil to the seeing eye of God. So gifted are literary authors at forcing us to confront what we would prefer to turn away from that, she proposes, we transcend the \u201cconfines of ordinary humanity\u201d as if illuminated by a \u201cdivine spark.\u201d\n\nI find two points of connection with Biggar\u2019s essay worth considering. First, in proposing the possibility of a God\u2019s eye view of evil, though severely limited by our finiteness and corrupted vision, we find a tacit recognition of divine order, that there is goodness which evil has disfigured. Indeed, I would argue that the dissonance we experience when confronting evil inspires a longing for goodness in the face of that disruption. A second related point, which is more germane to my consideration of literature in particular, is the unique capacity of art to help us appreciate how deeply dis ordered we humans are, and to such an extent that a divine order to existence seems remote, an inaccessible dream for which the world seems to offer little convincing evidence, let alone hope.\n\nThe Catholic novelist Flannery O\u2019Connor recognized this tension, though for her the recognition of sin as the premise for salvation and redemption was foremost in her mind. Believing that \u201cThe artist penetrates the concrete world in order to find at its depths the image of its source, the image of ultimate reality,\u201d [\u00a02\u00a0] she clarifies some of the difficulty that a Christian or religious writer in particular confronts when seeking to hold forth such a vision:\n\nThe novelist with Christian concerns will find in modern life distortions which are repugnant to him, and his problem will be to make them appear as distortions to an audience which is used to seeing them as natural; and he may be forced to take ever more violent means to get his vision across to this hostile audience. When you can assume that your audience holds the same beliefs you do, you can relax a little and use more normal ways of talking to it; when you have to assume that it does not, then you have to make your vision apparent by shock \u2014 to the hard of hearing you shout, and for the blind you draw large and startling figures. [\u00a03\u00a0]\n\nFor O\u2019Connor, literary artists needed to work hard not only to get people\u2019s attention but to direct their attention in particular ways (though she was careful to distinguish the writer\u2019s task from proselytizing). To move towards a recognition of order which may bear with it a hope of redemption in harmony with that order, the writer must convince her readers of their disorder. Images of that reality is the necessary prelude to capturing an \u201cimage of ultimate reality.\u201d Applied in this way, Callard\u2019s argument that \u2018art is for seeing evil\u2019 resonates with the prospect of seeing its opposite, as Biggar urges in his essay.\n\nDespite the promise of O\u2019Connor\u2019s ambitions for her work, however, there is another kind of literary art that addresses far more extreme experiences of disorder, what literary scholars call \u2018literature of trauma.\u2019 I am currently teaching a course on this subject at Yale Divinity School, exploring the literatures that arise out of significant historic traumas: war, the Holocaust, large scale injustice, oppression, and violence inflicted upon generations of people such as African and Native Americans. [\u00a04\u00a0]\n\nThese literatures come in many styles and are informed by a range of outlooks, including religious, in the same way that trauma itself has a variety of definitions and features. Some of the poetry and fiction we study resists hope and inclines towards despair; other works press in the opposite direction, attempting to at least gesture towards redemption. But across the multifaceted range of works in this genre one thing is consistent: trauma produces an acute sense of disorder, its victims and survivors left with feelings that defy sense and often emphasize an incapacity to perceive the world as anything but broken and fragmented.\n\nNot surprisingly, the very form of these works often mirrors those traumatic effects, in styles that can be similarly fragmented and disjointed. But what some may dismiss as expressions of \u2018postmodern\u2019 nihilism inflected (or infected ) by the conviction that there is no truth, no credible metanarrative, no divine order , is in fact the effects on art of real evil and its aftermath. I am not saying that a notable amount of literature written in the last several decades does not incline towards such postmodern sensibilities \u2013 plenty of it does. Nor am I saying that critical theorists, including literary scholars, do not share and even promote that kind of outlook \u2013 plenty of them do. They are no fans of what Nigel Biggar is attempting to affirm.\n\nBut I do want to argue that rather than simply denying the legitimacy of his viewpoint, literatures of trauma might problematize Dr. Biggar\u2019s assertions in important ways, without necessarily being attached to outlooks that reject them. They are not, to use his word, merely being \u2018perjorative\u2019 when expressing the impulse to reject a sensible orderliness to one\u2019s existence. They are expressions of pain. And authors writing out of or on behalf of those who suffer trauma seek to validate that experience and the disorientation that comes with it, and to underscore its reality. So, when Dr. Biggar asserts that \u201cthere are truths about reality that can be grasped,\u201d however limited or distorted are our capacities to do so, trauma literature, like trauma victims, may understandably take exception to that prospect. Another reality \u2013 trauma \u2013 poses a serious challenge to straightforward affirmations, a situation that Christians especially need to attend by first listening to the painful, disordering realities of those who suffer trauma before insisting upon commitments to a divinely ordered existence.\n\nThis is particularly the case given the theological cast of what Dr. Biggar means by \u2018order,\u2019 whether applied to moral law, social order, political order, or academic scholarship, in ways that demonstrate what he calls order\u2019s \u201ctense consensus.\u201d He rightly admits that although, in principle, everyone has access to moral laws that are remarkably consistent across time and cultures, human creatureliness and sinfulness hinders that access. My point about the value of regarding dis order resonates with this qualification, though I would like to take it further in light of the literary testimony to trauma as art that helps us \u2018to see evil.\u2019\n\nI do not deny the influence of the kinds of materialistic or postmodern philosophies that prejudice people to renounce an order to creation, and in the process may harm the prospect of human flourishing. No good can come to us by opposing our Creator or by questioning the fundamental goodness or purposefulness of his creation. But when people, even whole populations or generations of people, suffer horribly from horrors inflicted upon them, we do them a disservice if we do not attempt to inhabit that space with them, to live with them in that order-defying, and often hope-denying, experience. This can be a messy space, full of ambiguities, anger, and grief that diminish one\u2019s capacity to perceive the good, the true, and the beautiful. The art that helps us do this by bearing witness to the traumatic suffering of others, art that itself bears \u201cthe impress of extremity on the poetic imagination,\u201d as the poet-activist Carolyn Forch\u00e9 (1993) describes it, [\u00a05\u00a0] provides access for us. Such work enables us to contemplate the dis-order that trauma produces, and to respond with compassion \u2013 a response I am sure Dr. Biggar would applaud.\n\nThe poet Geoffrey Hill perhaps best depicted the process of living within disorder as an important prelude to our affirmations of order when he observed, \u201c Dissonance is the servant preparing the return of harmony .\u201d [\u00a06\u00a0] Hill is looking specifically at poetry that effects this by virtue of its formal qualities. But more broadly, he underscores the principle I am arguing for, that a recognition of the kinds of dissonances that trauma provokes needs to be understood and the persons who suffer them validated before assertions of order or harmony can be heard as paths towards hope and healing. Our charge as witnesses to trauma and on behalf of the traumatized, as the author Charlotte Delbo insists in her trilogy Auschwitz and After , is first \u201cto try to look, try to see.\u201d\n\nForch\u00e9, Carolyn.

In this paper I argue that love of neighbor involves a commitment to appreciate how complex both trauma and our memory of it can be from two examples of poems about the Holocaust.\n\nMorrison, Toni. Playing in the Dark: Whiteness and the Literary Imagination (Cambridge, MA: Harvard University Press, 1992).Morrison traces out the difficulties of establishing black literary voices who speak out of profound suffering in a literary establishment that often marginalizes or erases those voices.\n\nRambo, Shelly. \u201cSpirit and Trauma\u201d ( Interpretation , 2015, vol. 69). Rambo\u2019s provocative discussion of how Christian theology can respond to trauma by regarding both the integrity of those who suffer and of the theology that makes room for those experiences meaningfully.\n\nScarry, Elaine. The Body in Pain: The Making and Unmaking of the World (Oxford: Oxford University Press, 1985).In this classic work on trauma, Scarry explores the difficulties of translating trauma in ways that make the experiences of extreme suffering available to others, and the importance of art as a form of world-making that can help make victims and survivors visible to us.\n\nTal, Kali.

So gifted are literary authors at forcing us to confront what we would prefer to turn away from that, she proposes, we transcend the \u201cconfines of ordinary humanity\u201d as if illuminated by a \u201cdivine spark.\u201d</p>\n<p>I find two points of connection with Biggar\u2019s essay worth considering. First, in proposing the possibility of a God\u2019s eye view of evil, though severely limited by our finiteness and corrupted vision, we find a tacit recognition of divine order, that there is goodness which evil has disfigured. Indeed, I would argue that the dissonance we experience when confronting evil inspires a <i>longing</i> for goodness in the face of that disruption. A second related point, which is more germane to my consideration of literature in particular, is the unique capacity of art to help us appreciate how deeply <i>dis</i>ordered we humans are, and to such an extent that a divine order to existence seems remote, an inaccessible dream for which the world seems to offer little convincing evidence, let alone hope.</p>\n<p>The Catholic novelist Flannery O\u2019Connor recognized this tension, though for her the recognition of sin as the premise for salvation and redemption was foremost in her mind. Believing that \u201cThe artist penetrates the concrete world in order to find at its depths the image of its source, the image of ultimate reality,\u201d<a class=\"anchor\" id=\"content100note2anc\" name=\"content100note2anc\">\u00a0</a><a class=\"note\" href=\"#content100note2sym\">[\u00a02\u00a0]</a> she clarifies some of the difficulty that a Christian or religious writer in particular confronts when seeking to hold forth such a vision:</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p><em>The novelist with Christian concerns will find in modern life distortions which are repugnant to him, and his problem will be to make them appear as distortions to an audience which is used to seeing them as natural; and he may be forced to take ever more violent means to get his vision across to this hostile audience.

To move towards a recognition of order which may bear with it a hope of redemption in harmony with that order, the writer must convince her readers of their disorder. Images of that reality is the necessary prelude to capturing an \u201cimage of ultimate reality.\u201d Applied in this way, Callard\u2019s argument that \u2018art is for seeing evil\u2019 resonates with the prospect of seeing its opposite, as Biggar urges in his essay.</p>\n<h2>Reading Trauma</h2>\n<p>Despite the promise of O\u2019Connor\u2019s ambitions for her work, however, there is another kind of literary art that addresses far more extreme experiences of disorder, what literary scholars call \u2018literature of trauma.\u2019 I am currently teaching a course on this subject at Yale Divinity School, exploring the literatures that arise out of significant historic traumas: war, the Holocaust, large scale injustice, oppression, and violence inflicted upon generations of people such as African and Native Americans.<a class=\"anchor\" id=\"content100note4anc\" name=\"content100note4anc\">\u00a0</a><a class=\"note\" href=\"#content100note4sym\">[\u00a04\u00a0]</a></p>\n<p>These literatures come in many styles and are informed by a range of outlooks, including religious, in the same way that trauma itself has a variety of definitions and features. Some of the poetry and fiction we study resists hope and inclines towards despair; other works press in the opposite direction, attempting to at least gesture towards redemption. But across the multifaceted range of works in this genre one thing is consistent: trauma produces an acute sense of disorder, its victims and survivors left with feelings that defy sense and often emphasize an incapacity to perceive the world as anything but broken and fragmented.</p>\n<p>Not surprisingly, the very form of these works often mirrors those traumatic effects, in styles that can be similarly fragmented and disjointed. But what some may dismiss as expressions of \u2018postmodern\u2019 nihilism inflected (or <i>infected</i>) by the conviction that there is no truth, no credible metanarrative, no <i>divine order</i>, is in fact the effects on art of real evil and its aftermath. I am not saying that a notable amount of literature written in the last several decades does not incline towards such postmodern sensibilities \u2013 plenty of it does. Nor am I saying that critical theorists, including literary scholars, do not share and even promote that kind of outlook \u2013 plenty of them do. They are no fans of what Nigel Biggar is attempting to affirm.</p>\n<p>But I do want to argue that rather than simply denying the legitimacy of his viewpoint, literatures of trauma might problematize Dr. Biggar\u2019s assertions in important ways, without necessarily being attached to outlooks that reject them. They are not, to use his word, merely being \u2018perjorative\u2019 when expressing the impulse to reject a sensible orderliness to one\u2019s existence. They are expressions of pain. And authors writing out of or on behalf of those who suffer trauma seek to validate that experience and the disorientation that comes with it, and to underscore <i>its</i> reality. So, when Dr. Biggar asserts that \u201cthere are truths about reality that can be grasped,\u201d however limited or distorted are our capacities to do so, trauma literature, like trauma victims, may understandably take exception to that prospect. Another reality \u2013 trauma \u2013 poses a serious challenge to straightforward affirmations, a situation that Christians especially need to attend by first listening to the painful, disordering realities of those who suffer trauma before insisting upon commitments to a divinely ordered existence.</p>\n<h2>Living with Disorder</h2>\n<p>This is particularly the case given the theological cast of what Dr. Biggar means by \u2018order,\u2019 whether applied to moral law, social order, political order, or academic scholarship, in ways that demonstrate what he calls order\u2019s \u201ctense consensus.\u201d He rightly admits that although, in principle, everyone has access to moral laws that are remarkably consistent across time and cultures, human creatureliness and sinfulness hinders that access. My point about the value of regarding <i>dis</i>order resonates with this qualification, though I would like to take it further in light of the literary testimony to trauma as art that helps us \u2018to see evil.\u2019</p>\n<p>I do not deny the influence of the kinds of materialistic or postmodern philosophies that prejudice people to renounce an order to creation, and in the process may harm the prospect of human flourishing. No good can come to us by opposing our Creator or by questioning the fundamental goodness or purposefulness of his creation. But when people, even whole populations or generations of people, suffer horribly from horrors inflicted upon them, we do them a disservice if we do not attempt to inhabit that space with them, to live with them in that order-defying, and often hope-denying, experience. This can be a messy space, full of ambiguities, anger, and grief that diminish one\u2019s capacity to perceive the good, the true, and the beautiful. The art that helps us do this by bearing witness to the traumatic suffering of others, art that itself bears \u201cthe impress of extremity on the poetic imagination,\u201d as the poet-activist Carolyn Forch\u00e9 (1993) describes it,<a class=\"anchor\" id=\"content100note5anc\" name=\"content100note5anc\">\u00a0</a><a class=\"note\" href=\"#content100note5sym\">[\u00a05\u00a0]</a> provides access for us. Such work enables us to contemplate the dis-order that trauma produces, and to respond with compassion \u2013 a response I am sure Dr. Biggar would applaud.</p>\n<h2>Preparing for the Return to Harmony</h2>\n<p>The poet Geoffrey Hill perhaps best depicted the process of living within disorder as an important prelude to our affirmations of order when he observed, \u201c<i>Dissonance is the servant preparing the return of harmony</i>.\u201d<a class=\"anchor\" id=\"content100note6anc\" name=\"content100note6anc\">\u00a0</a><a class=\"note\" href=\"#content100note6sym\">[\u00a06\u00a0]</a> Hill is looking specifically at poetry that effects this by virtue of its formal qualities. But more broadly, he underscores the principle I am arguing for, that a recognition of the kinds of dissonances that trauma provokes needs to be understood and the persons who suffer them validated before assertions of order or harmony can be heard as paths towards hope and healing. Our charge as witnesses to trauma and on behalf of the traumatized, as the author Charlotte Delbo insists in her trilogy <i>Auschwitz and After</i>, is first \u201cto try to look, try to see.\u201d</p>\n<h2 class=\"new_page\">Further Reading</h2>\n<p>Forch\u00e9, Carolyn. <i>Against Forgetting: Twentieth Poetry of Witness</i> (New York: Norton, 1993).

    "bodyText": "A prominent theme in Professor Biggar\u2019s essay \u201cOrder\u201d is that of embodied goodness \u2013 that is, of the goodness possessed by God and by things of divine and human creation. There are some writers who hold that there is no embodied goodness, no objective worth or praiseworthiness in things. Things have value because we human beings value them. Biggar rightly insists that fundamental in the Christian understanding of reality is the affirmation of objective embodied goodness. He reminds us that seven times over in the first chapter of Genesis we read, \u201cGod saw that what God had made was good.\u201d The things God made are not of worth because we value them; when things go well, we value them because we discern their objective worth. Of course, evil has entered the world God made; but the evil has not eliminated the good.\n\nIn my response to Biggar\u2019s essay I will point to three areas in which this idea of embodied goodness has played a prominent and indispensable role in my own thinking and writing. Before I do so, however, let me very briefly call attention to another aspect of the Christian understanding of order that is implicit in Biggar\u2019s essay.\n\nAn essay that I titled \u201cThe World Ready-Made\u201d opens with these words:\n\nThat there is, and long has been, a world of kinds of things and of things belonging to those kinds, these for the most part existing independent of our human endeavors and characterized and related in ways that for the most part are also independent of our human endeavors \u2013 this is the thesis that I will be articulating and defending in this essay. [\u00a01\u00a0]\n\nHere\u2019s why. A few decades ago a number of philosophers were arguing that there is no way things are apart from how we human beings conceptualize them \u2013 no ready-made world. Metaphysical anti-realism the view was called. Among the most prominent philosophers articulating and defending metaphysical anti-realism was the Harvard philosopher, Hilary Putnam. After remarking that \u201con the perspective of metaphysical realism . . . the world consists of some fixed totality of mind-independent reality,\u201d Putnam goes on to express his opposition: the phrase \u201c \u2018of the same kind\u2019 makes no sense apart from a categoreal system which says what properties do and what properties do not count as similarities.\u201d \u201cObjects do not exist independently of categoreal schemes. We cut up the world into objects when we introduce one or another scheme of description.\u201d [\u00a02\u00a0]\n\nIn my article I argued philosophically that metaphysical anti-realism proves, on close scrutiny, to be incoherent. I did not note that, on the biblical picture of things, God the creator placed human beings in a world ready-made \u2013 a world of oceans, earth, and sky, of plants of many sorts, of sun and moon and stars, of living creatures of land, sea, and air.\n\nIn his Brief Biggar writes, \u201cWhat is good is the foundation of moral order, since morally right behavior defends or promotes what is good, while morally wrong behavior damages it\u201d (p. 4). In another place he writes, along similar lines, \u201cGoods are the fundamental principles of a moral system, being logically prior to moral rules of conduct. Morally right conduct promotes the goods; morally wrong conduct detracts from them\u201d (p. 5). In yet another place he writes, the \u201ccreated, given, natural, objective moral order compris[es] basic human goods and moral order\u201d (p. 6). In several places he calls the goods that morally right conduct defends or promotes human goods. They are, he says \u201ccomponents\u201d of \u201chuman flourishing\u201d (p. 4).\n\nAssuming that by \u201cmorally right conduct\u201d Biggar means morally obligatory conduct. I share his view that morally right conduct \u2013 conduct that is obligatory \u2013 defends or promotes human goods and that morally wrong conduct damages human goods. I am also of the view, however, that not all cases of promoting someone\u2019s good are examples of obligatory (right) conduct, nor that all cases of \u201cdamaging\u201d someone\u2019s good are examples of morally wrong conduct.\n\nThere are many examples of the former. Generosity, for example, often goes beyond the obligatory. Suppose that you admire one of my graphic art prints and I impulsively say, \u201cHere, take it, it\u2019s yours.\u201d You protest: \u201cNo, no, you keep it.\u201d \u201cNo,\u201d I say, \u201cI want you to have it. Please.\u201d Assume that having the print hanging on your wall would be a good in your life.\n\nI am nonetheless not obligated to offer it to you. My act of offering it to you is what philosophers call supererogatory.\n\nAn example of the opposite point: suppose that I am the judge in a piano contest and that you are one of the contestants. I know you well and know that you not only have your heart set on winning first prize but that you fully expect to do so. As it turns out, however, you were not the best, and I cannot, in good conscience, declare you the winner. You are crushed and angry. I have definitely \u201cdamaged\u201d your human good. Nonetheless, I have not wronged you.\n\nThe heading of one of the sections in Biggar\u2019s essay is \u201cHow basic human goods generate natural law.\u201d Basic human goods do not, by themselves, generate natural moral law. The concept of human goods is not sufficient for explaining moral law. Something else is needed.\n\nI regard one of the most important \u2013 and difficult \u2013 issues facing those of us who think about ethics and morality to be explaining why some ways of promoting someone\u2019s good are obligatory and some are not, and why some ways of diminishing someone\u2019s good are wrongful and some are not. Biggar takes no note of the issue in his Brief.\n\nIn the literature on these matters, some writers propose that obligations are not a component of objective reality but are created by human beings, the most common suggestion being that they are created by our practice of holding each other accountable. Suffice it here to remark that, for every explanation of\u201d holding accountable\u201d that I have seen, you can be held accountable for doing something without your being obligated to do it, and you can be obligated to do something without anyone holding you accountable for doing it.\n\nMost writers who hold that obligations are a component of objective reality have explored one or the other of two ways of accounting for why it is that some ways of promoting someone\u2019s good are obligatory and some are not, and why some ways of diminishing someone\u2019s good are wrongful and some are not.\n\nA good many writers in the Christian tradition have suggested that what accounts for obligation is God\u2019s commands \u2013 the so-called divine command theory. A way of advancing someone\u2019s good is obligatory just in case God commands it. This was the view that John Locke espoused in his Essay concerning Human Understanding, and it is the view that the contemporary philosopher, Robert Adams, develops in his Finite and Infinite Goods. In Chapter Twelve of my Justice: Rights and Wrongs, I discussed the divine command theory in detail and concluded that, for reasons that I won\u2019t rehearse here, it does not work. [\u00a03\u00a0]\n\nThe principal other way of accounting for obligation that one finds in the literature, the way that I favor, requires that we appeal to the worth of persons. When Biggar speaks of human goods, what he clearly has in mind is goods in a person\u2019s life, life-goods, goods that contribute to the person\u2019s flourishing. As examples of such goods he cites \u201cthe basic human good of knowledge of the truth\u201d (p. 5) and \u201cthe basic human good of friendship with God\u201d (p. 6). What surprises me is that he nowhere makes mention of the worth of persons \u2013 the fact that it is not only the lives of persons that are praiseworthy in various respects but that persons themselves are praiseworthy: praiseworthy for their moral character, for their intellectual or athletic abilities, for their capacity for empathy, etc. Fundamental to the biblical understanding of human beings is that each and every one of us also possesses the ineradicable dignity of bearing the image of God. Embodied goodness is present not only in the lives of persons but in the persons themselves.\n\nA corollary of the fact that human beings are praiseworthy in various respects is that we can pay our fellows due respect for their worth or fail to do so. What makes it not gratuitous but obligatory to promote some life-good of a fellow human being is that failure to do so would be to treat them in a way that does not befit their worth, their excellence, their goodness. The reason that it\u2019s not obligatory for me to offer my friend one of my graphic art prints, even though having it on her wall would be a good in her life, is that not offering it to her does not, in any way, amount to not treating her with due respect for her worth. [\u00a04\u00a0]\n\nI have written a good deal in the area of philosophy of art. Let me indicate the way in which the idea of embodied goodness has played a role in my thought and writing in this area.\n\nA distinction that was unnecessary up to this point, but that will now be indispensable, is that between instrumental goodness and intrinsic goodness. The instrumental goodness of a thing is the goodness it has on account of the contribution it makes to the goodness of something else. The intrinsic goodness of a thing is the goodness it has whether or not it contributes to the goodness of something else. Quite obviously, for something to have instrumental goodness, somewhere along the line there has to be something that has intrinsic goodness. Both the life-goods of persons and persons themselves have intrinsic goodness.\n\nAlmost all theories in the modern and contemporary period concerning the worth of works of art are instrumentalist theories. The worth of works of art, so it is claimed or assumed, consists in their contributing to something else that is of intrinsic worth. The \u201csomething else\u201d that is held to be of intrinsic worth is always an experience of a certain sort. The deepest disagreements among modern and contemporary theories of artistic worth are disagreements about the nature of that experience.\n\nThe emotivist tradition holds that the intrinsically valuable experience that imparts worth to works of art is an emotion of a certain sort. The alethic tradition (from the Greek for \u201ctruth,\u201d aletheia ) holds that the fundamental worth of works of art is to be located in their giving us knowledge of certain sorts. The aestheticist tradition holds that the worth-imparting experience is aesthetic experience. In my early writing about philosophy of art, I was a resolute exponent of the aestheticist tradition.\n\nThen one day in the spring of 2007 I experienced an awakening. The distinguished American poet, Donald Hall, paid a visit to the University of Virginia. In addition to giving a public lecture, he led a small seminar for young aspiring poets. I was invited to attend as an auditor. To illuminate some point he was making, Hall would often refer to changes he had make in some of his own poems between early drafts and final versions. I remember well one of those changes. In an early draft of one of his poems he had spoken of a dog wagging its tail; in the final version he changed that to the dog swinging its tail. A student asked why he had made the change. Hall replied, \u201cBecause it made it a better poem.\u201d He did not explain why it made it a better poem and the student did not ask. Probably we all thought, \u201cOf course.\u201d\n\nHall\u2019s quick remark had an effect on me that, I am sure, it had on no one else. He did not say that he changed the line because he thought it would give his readers greater aesthetic delight, nor did he refer to any other anticipated effect on his readers. He said that he changed it because it would make it a better poem. He implicitly attributed intrinsic worth to the poem. His remark provoked me into reconsidering my instrumentalist assumptions, the eventual outcome of which was that I now regard artistic instrumentalism as untenable. Let me spend a few paragraphs explaining why. [\u00a05\u00a0]\n\nAn articulate defense of an instrumentalist theory of artistic worth is Alan H. Goldman\u2019s 1995 publication, Aesthetic Value. [\u00a06\u00a0] , he says, He writes in one place,\n\nThe challenge of great works to our perceptual, cognitive, and affective capacities, and their full occupation and fulfillment in meeting that challenge, removes us entirely from the real world of our practical affairs. It is in the ultimately satisfying exercise of these different mental capacities operating together to appreciate the rich relational properties that I shall argue the primary value of great works is to be found. (p. 8)\n\nGoldman speaks here of us and of our capacities. To whom is he referring? The worth of a work of art, he says, consists in the degree of satisfaction we get from meeting the challenge it presents to us of exercising together our various mental capacities when we appreciate it. Who is the we and the us in question?\n\nIs it each of those who engage the work, and is Goldman espousing a relativist theory of artistic worth? Is it his view that if some work gives me no satisfaction of the sort he delineates, whereas it gives you a great deal of satisfaction, then it is worthless relative to me but of great worth relative to you ? That is not Goldman\u2019s view. The theory he develops is what he calls an ideal critic view. The worth of a work of art is determined by the satisfaction an ideal critic would experience in meeting the challenges it presents.\n\nAnd what must a critic be like to be ideal? He or she must be, says Goldman, knowledgeable, unbiased, sensitive, and of developed taste. Goldman spends several pages explaining what he means by each of these terms. For our purposes here we can forego getting into that. Whatever his explanation of his use of each of these terms, notice that it is character traits that he is appealing to; to be an ideal critic, one must possess the four character traits that he mentions.\n\nThe critic\u2019s possession of the four character traits does not, however, guarantee the ideality that the theory requires. For one thing, the character traits must be employed in an ideal way. I may have all the character traits necessary to be an ideal critic for Stravinsky\u2019s Mass; but if, while listening to the Mass, I find myself distracted by some conflict that has arisen between me and my neighbors, my satisfaction level might be low even though the Mass is one of the finest musical works of the twentieth century.\n\nAnd not only must the critic employ the ideal character traits in an ideal way; he or she must employ them in ideal physical circumstances. If loud sustained noises intrude from outside during a performance of the Mass , the degree of satisfaction that I get from listening to the work in this situation is no indication whatsoever of the worth of the work.\n\nTwo observations are now in order. Is there any reason to suppose that there is an end to the project of preventing discrepancy between the worth of the work and the critic\u2019s degree of satisfaction by specifying conditions of ideality? Second, and more important: it is now evident that there is something fundamentally misguided about the very project of specifying idealizing conditions in the course of developing an instrumentalist theory of artistic value.\n\nAn instrumentalist theorist such as Goldman approaches the project of specifying idealized conditions having already recognized the worth of a good many works of art. What he then tries to do is identify persons of certain character traits who employ those character traits in certain ways and in certain conditions such that, necessarily, the degree of satisfaction of the person with those character traits who employs them in that way in that situation matches the worth of the work. The theorist makes the judgment that works have worth of such-and-such a degree before he sets out to identify the idealizing conditions. If he did make those prior judgments of worth, he could not determine whether he had succeeded in identifying the ideality conditions. But then the worth of works of art cannot consist in the degree of satisfaction that an ideal critic experiences when functioning in an ideal way in ideal circumstances.\n\nWorks of art have intrinsic worth. In discerning their intrinsic worth, we find satisfaction \u2013 and sometimes more than mere satisfaction. Love. I love Stravinsky\u2019s Mass.\n\nLet me very briefly mention just one other area of inquiry in which the idea of embodied goodness has played a prominent and indispensable role in my thought and writing, namely, in my writing about liturgy, in particular, Christian liturgy.\n\nMany are the reasons believers have had, and do have, for assembling to enact their liturgy. From the prophetic literature of the Hebrew Bible/Old Testament it\u2019s clear that a common view in ancient Israel was that believers assemble to enact their liturgy so as to please God \u2013 perhaps even to appease God. In our own times one often hears it said that the point of participating in some liturgical enactment is that it enables one to \u201ccenter\u201d oneself. And then there are those who hold that it is of benefit for their daily lives: it gives them guidance, motivates them to act in certain way, gives them courage in facing life\u2019s troubles. What I have argued in my writing on liturgy is that, at the heart of Christian liturgy, rightly practiced, is worship, understood as acknowledgment of the unsurpassable excellence of God. [\u00a07\u00a0]\n\nThere is more to the Christian liturgy than that. There is, among other components, confession of sin and intercessory prayer. But those get their sense, their meaning, from the context in which they occur, the context of worship.\n\nSo, too, there are other ways of acknowledging the unsurpassable excellence of God. We do so when, in our lives in the everyday, we carry out the prophetic call to imitate God by doing justice and loving mercy. But that is not worshipping God. Why not? What is distinctive of worship of God?\n\nPart of what is distinctive of worship of GoD is what one might call its orientation . In our lives in the everyday we are oriented toward our tasks, toward our fellow human beings and their works, toward the created world. When we worship God we turn around and face God. Our acknowledgement of God\u2019s unsurpassable excellence is Godward in its orientation. We kneel, we bow, we stand with face and hands uplifted. There is no creature before whom we are bowing, before whom we are kneeling, before whom we are standing. We are bowing, kneeling, and standing with face and hands uplifted before God.\n\nThis is close to identifying that mode of acknowledging God\u2019s excellence that constitutes worship but not quite there yet. A theologian, oriented toward God, might discourse about the excellence of God, thereby acknowledging the excellence of God; but that would not be worship of God. Why not? What is missing?\n\nWhat is missing is a certain attitudinal stance of the person toward God. The heart of that that attitudinal stance, I would say, is adoration. Worship of God is adoration of God. One can stand in adoration of many things, however, not just of God \u2013 of a landscape, for example. The worship of God is a distinct kind of adoration. At its core in the Christian tradition are awe, reverence, and gratitude. Christian worship is that Godward mode of acknowledging God\u2019s excellence whose attitudinal stance is awed, reverential, and grateful adoration.\n\nAdams, Robert, Finite and Infinite Goods (Oxford: Oxford University Press, 1999).

After the publication of the book my good friend, Terence Cuneo, called to my attention the fact that my argument against the divine command theory of obligation had already been advanced by the eighteenth century English theologian, Bishop Butler.\n\n[\u00a04\u00a0] In my discussion of these matters in Justice: Rights and Wrongs, I argued the case in terms of rights rather than obligations: I developed what one might call a \u201cdignity-based\u201d theory of rights, rather than a \u201cdignity-based\u201d theory of obligations. It is my view that obligations and rights are correlative in the following way: if I have an obligation to treat you a certain way, then you have a right to my treating you that way, and vice versa. So a dignity-based theory of rights has, as its corrolary, a dignity-based theory of obligations, and vice versa.\n\n[\u00a05\u00a0] My argument is fleshed out in the chapter titled \u201cWhat Sort of Worth Do Works of Art Have,\u201d included in my collection, United In Love: Essays on Justice, Art, and Liturgy (Eugene, OR: Cascade Books, 2021).\n\n[\u00a06\u00a0] Boulder, CO: Westview, 1995.\n\n[\u00a07\u00a0] See especially chapter 2, \u201cGod as Worthy of Worship\u201d in my The God We Worship: An Exploration of Liturgical Theology (Grand Rapids: William B.

There are some writers who hold that there is no embodied goodness, no objective worth or praiseworthiness in things. Things have value because we human beings value them. Biggar rightly insists that fundamental in the Christian understanding of reality is the affirmation of objective embodied goodness. He reminds us that seven times over in the first chapter of Genesis we read, \u201cGod saw that what God had made was good.\u201d The things God made are not of worth because we value them; when things go well, we value them because we discern their objective worth. Of course, evil has entered the world God made; but the evil has not eliminated the good.</p>\n<p>In my response to Biggar\u2019s essay I will point to three areas in which this idea of embodied goodness has played a prominent and indispensable role in my own thinking and writing. Before I do so, however, let me very briefly call attention to another aspect of the Christian understanding of order that is implicit in Biggar\u2019s essay.</p>\n<p>An essay that I titled \u201cThe World Ready-Made\u201d opens with these words:</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>That there is, and long has been, a world of kinds of things and of things belonging to those kinds, these for the most part existing independent of our human endeavors and characterized and related in ways that for the most part are also independent of our human endeavors \u2013 this is the thesis that I will be articulating and defending in this essay.<a class=\"anchor\" id=\"content100note1anc\" name=\"content100note1anc\">\u00a0</a><a class=\"note\" href=\"#content100note1sym\">[\u00a01\u00a0]</a></p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>That there is, and long has been, a world of kinds of things and of things belonging to those kinds, these for the most part existing independent of our human endeavors and characterized and related in ways that for the most part are also independent of our human endeavors \u2013 this is the thesis that I will be articulating and defending in this essay.<a class=\"anchor\" id=\"content100note1anc\" name=\"content100note1anc\">\u00a0</a><a class=\"note\" href=\"#content100note1sym\">[\u00a01\u00a0]</a></p>\n<p>No doubt most readers of this Disciplinary Brief will regard what I say here, with these rather labored lines, as obviously true. Why bother to say it?</p>\n<p>Here\u2019s why. A few decades ago a number of philosophers were arguing that there is no way things are apart from how we human beings conceptualize them \u2013 no ready-made world. <i>Metaphysical anti-realism</i> the view was called. Among the most prominent philosophers articulating and defending metaphysical anti-realism was the Harvard philosopher, Hilary Putnam. After remarking that \u201con the perspective of metaphysical realism . . . the world consists of some fixed totality of mind-independent reality,\u201d Putnam goes on to express his opposition: the phrase \u201c \u2018of the same kind\u2019 makes no sense apart from a categoreal system which says what properties do and what properties do not count as similarities.\u201d \u201cObjects do not exist independently of categoreal schemes. <i>We </i>cut up the world into objects when we introduce one or another scheme of description.\u201d<a class=\"anchor\" id=\"content100note2anc\" name=\"content100note2anc\">\u00a0</a><a class=\"note\" href=\"#content100note2sym\">[\u00a02\u00a0]</a></p>\n<p>In my article I argued philosophically that metaphysical anti-realism proves, on close scrutiny, to be incoherent. I did not note that, on the biblical picture of things, God the creator placed human beings in a world ready-made \u2013 a world of oceans, earth, and sky, of plants of many sorts, of sun and moon and stars, of living creatures of land, sea, and air.</p>\n<h2>The good and the obligatory: The embodied goodness of human lives and of human beings</h2>\n<p>In his Brief Biggar writes, \u201cWhat is good is the foundation of moral order, since morally right behavior defends or promotes what is good, while morally wrong behavior damages it\u201d (p. 4). In another place he writes, along similar lines, \u201cGoods are the fundamental principles of a moral system, being logically prior to moral rules of conduct. Morally right conduct promotes the goods; morally wrong conduct detracts from them\u201d (p. 5). In yet another place he writes, the \u201ccreated, given, natural, objective moral order compris[es] basic human goods and moral order\u201d (p. 6). In several places he calls the goods that morally right conduct defends or promotes <i>human goods. </i>They are, he says \u201ccomponents\u201d of \u201chuman flourishing\u201d (p. 4).</p>\n<p>Assuming that by \u201cmorally right conduct\u201d Biggar means <i>morally obligatory conduct. </i>I share his view that morally right conduct \u2013 conduct that is obligatory \u2013 defends or promotes human goods and that morally wrong conduct damages human goods. I am also of the view, however, that not all cases of promoting someone\u2019s good are examples of obligatory (right) conduct, nor that all cases of \u201cdamaging\u201d someone\u2019s good are examples of morally wrong conduct.</p>\n<p>There are many examples of the former. Generosity, for example, often goes beyond the obligatory. Suppose that you admire one of my graphic art prints and I impulsively say, \u201cHere, take it, it\u2019s yours.\u201d You protest: \u201cNo, no, you keep it.\u201d \u201cNo,\u201d I say, \u201cI want you to have it. Please.\u201d Assume that having the print hanging on your wall would be a good in your life.</p>\n<p>I am nonetheless not obligated to offer it to you. My act of offering it to you is what philosophers call <i>supererogatory.</i></p>\n<p>An example of the opposite point: suppose that I am the judge in a piano contest and that you are one of the contestants. I know you well and know that you not only have your heart set on winning first prize but that you fully expect to do so. As it turns out, however, you were not the best, and I cannot, in good conscience, declare you the winner. You are crushed and angry. I have definitely \u201cdamaged\u201d your human good. Nonetheless, I have not wronged you.</p>\n<p>The heading of one of the sections in Biggar\u2019s essay is \u201cHow basic human goods generate natural law.\u201d Basic human goods do not, by themselves, generate natural moral law. The concept of human goods is not sufficient for explaining moral law. Something else is needed.</p>\n<p>I regard one of the most important \u2013 and difficult \u2013 issues facing those of us who think about ethics and morality to be explaining why some ways of promoting someone\u2019s good are obligatory and some are not, and why some ways of diminishing someone\u2019s good are wrongful and some are not. Biggar takes no note of the issue in his Brief.</p>\n<p>In the literature on these matters, some writers propose that obligations are not a component of objective reality but are created by human beings, the most common suggestion being that they are created by our practice of holding each other accountable. Suffice it here to remark that, for every explanation of\u201d holding accountable\u201d that I have seen, you can be held accountable for doing something without your being obligated to do it, and you can be obligated to do something without anyone holding you accountable for doing it.</p>\n<p>Most writers who hold that obligations are a component of objective reality have explored one or the other of two ways of accounting for why it is that some ways of promoting someone\u2019s good are obligatory and some are not, and why some ways of diminishing someone\u2019s good are wrongful and some are not.</p>\n<p>A good many writers in the Christian tradition have suggested that what accounts for obligation is God\u2019s commands \u2013 the so-called <i>divine command theory. </i>A way of advancing someone\u2019s good is obligatory just in case God commands it. This was the view that John Locke espoused in his <i>Essay concerning Human Understanding, </i>and it is the view that the contemporary philosopher, Robert Adams, develops in his <i>Finite and Infinite Goods. </i>In Chapter Twelve of my <i>Justice: Rights and Wrongs,</i> I discussed the divine command theory in detail and concluded that, for reasons that I won\u2019t rehearse here, it does not work.<a class=\"anchor\" id=\"content100note3anc\" name=\"content100note3anc\">\u00a0</a><a class=\"note\" href=\"#content100note3sym\">[\u00a03\u00a0]</a></p>\n<p>The principal other way of accounting for obligation that one finds in the literature, the way that I favor, requires that we appeal to the worth of persons. When Biggar speaks of <i>human goods, </i>what he clearly has in mind is goods in a person\u2019s life, life-goods, goods that contribute to the person\u2019s flourishing. As examples of such goods he cites \u201cthe basic human good of knowledge of the truth\u201d (p. 5) and \u201cthe basic human good of friendship with God\u201d (p. 6). What surprises me is that he nowhere makes mention of the worth of persons \u2013 the fact that it is not only the lives of persons that are praiseworthy in various respects but that persons themselves are praiseworthy: praiseworthy for their moral character, for their intellectual or athletic abilities, for their capacity for empathy, etc. Fundamental to the biblical understanding of human beings is that each and every one of us also possesses the ineradicable dignity of bearing the image of God. Embodied goodness is present not only in the lives of persons but in the persons themselves.</p>\n<p>A corollary of the fact that human beings are praiseworthy in various respects is that we can pay our fellows due respect for their worth or fail to do so. What makes it not gratuitous but obligatory to promote some life-good of a fellow human being is that failure to do so would be to treat them in a way that does not befit their worth, their excellence, their goodness. The reason that it\u2019s not obligatory for me to offer my friend one of my graphic art prints, even though having it on her wall would be a good in her life, is that not offering it to her does not, in any way, amount to not treating her with due respect for her worth.<a class=\"anchor\" id=\"content100note4anc\" name=\"content100note4anc\">\u00a0</a><a class=\"note\" href=\"#content100note4sym\">[\u00a04\u00a0]</a></p>\n<h2>The embodied goodness of works of art</h2>\n<p>I have written a good deal in the area of philosophy of art. Let me indicate the way in which the idea of embodied goodness has played a role in my thought and writing in this area.</p>\n<p>A distinction that was unnecessary up to this point, but that will now be indispensable, is that between <i>instrumental goodness </i>and <i>intrinsic goodness.</i> The <i>instrumental </i>goodness of a thing is the goodness it has on account of the contribution it makes to the goodness of something else. The <i>intrinsic</i> goodness of a thing is the goodness it has whether or not it contributes to the goodness of something else. Quite obviously, for something to have instrumental goodness, somewhere along the line there has to be something that has intrinsic goodness. Both the life-goods of persons and persons themselves have intrinsic goodness.</p>\n<p>Almost all theories in the modern and contemporary period concerning the worth of works of art are instrumentalist theories. The worth of works of art, so it is claimed or assumed, consists in their contributing to something else that is of intrinsic worth. The \u201csomething else\u201d that is held to be of intrinsic worth is always an experience of a certain sort. The deepest disagreements among modern and contemporary theories of artistic worth are disagreements about the nature of that experience.</p>\n<p>The <i>emotivist </i>tradition holds that the intrinsically valuable experience that imparts worth to works of art is an emotion of a certain sort. The <i>alethic </i>tradition (from the Greek for \u201ctruth,\u201d <i>aletheia</i>) holds that the fundamental worth of works of art is to be located in their giving us knowledge of certain sorts. The <i>aestheticist </i>tradition holds that the worth-imparting experience is aesthetic<i> </i>experience. In my early writing about philosophy of art, I was a resolute exponent of the aestheticist tradition.</p>\n<p>Then one day in the spring of 2007 I experienced an awakening. The distinguished American poet, Donald Hall, paid a visit to the University of Virginia. In addition to giving a public lecture, he led a small seminar for young aspiring poets. I was invited to attend as an auditor. To illuminate some point he was making, Hall would often refer to changes he had make in some of his own poems between early drafts and final versions. I remember well one of those changes. In an early draft of one of his poems he had spoken of a dog wagging its tail; in the final version he changed that to the dog swinging its tail. A student asked why he had made the change. Hall replied, \u201cBecause it made it a better poem.\u201d He did not explain why it made it a better poem and the student did not ask. Probably we all thought, \u201cOf course.\u201d</p>\n<p>Hall\u2019s quick remark had an effect on me that, I am sure, it had on no one else. He did not say that he changed the line because he thought it would give his readers greater aesthetic delight, nor did he refer to any other anticipated effect on his readers. He said that he changed it because it would make it a better poem. He implicitly attributed <i>intrinsic </i>worth to the poem. His remark provoked me into reconsidering my instrumentalist assumptions, the eventual outcome of which was that I now regard artistic instrumentalism as untenable. Let me spend a few paragraphs explaining why.<a class=\"anchor\" id=\"content100note5anc\" name=\"content100note5anc\">\u00a0</a><a class=\"note\" href=\"#content100note5sym\">[\u00a05\u00a0]</a></p>\n<p>An articulate defense of an instrumentalist theory of artistic worth is Alan H.

(p. 8)</p>\n<p>Goldman speaks here of <i>us </i>and of <i>our </i>capacities. To whom is he referring? The worth of a work of art, he says, consists in the degree of satisfaction <i>we</i> get from meeting the challenge it presents to <i>us </i>of exercising together <i>our </i>various mental capacities when <i>we </i>appreciate it. Who is the <i>we </i>and the <i>us </i>in question?</p>\n<p>Is it each of those who engage the work, and is Goldman espousing a relativist theory of artistic worth? Is it his view that if some work gives me no satisfaction of the sort he delineates, whereas it gives you a great deal of satisfaction, then it is worthless <i>relative to me </i>but of great worth <i>relative to you</i>? That is not Goldman\u2019s view. The theory he develops is what he calls an <i>ideal critic </i>view. The worth of a work of art is determined by the satisfaction an <i>ideal critic </i>would experience in meeting the challenges it presents.</p>\n<p>And what must a critic be like to be ideal?

What I have argued in my writing on liturgy is that, at the heart of Christian liturgy, rightly practiced, is worship, understood as acknowledgment of the unsurpassable excellence of God.<a class=\"anchor\" id=\"content100note7anc\" name=\"content100note7anc\">\u00a0</a><a class=\"note\" href=\"#content100note7sym\">[\u00a07\u00a0]</a></p>\n<p>There is more to the Christian liturgy than that. There is, among other components, confession of sin and intercessory prayer. But those get their sense, their meaning, from the context in which they occur, the context of worship.</p>\n<p>So, too, there are other ways of acknowledging the unsurpassable excellence of God. We do so when, in our lives in the everyday, we carry out the prophetic call to imitate God by doing justice and loving mercy. But that is not worshipping God. Why not? What is distinctive of worship of God?</p>\n<p>Part of what is distinctive of worship of GoD is what one might call its <i>orientation</i>. In our lives in the everyday we are oriented toward our tasks, toward our fellow human beings and their works, toward the created world. When we worship God we turn around and face God. Our acknowledgement of God\u2019s unsurpassable excellence is <i>Godward </i>in its orientation. We kneel, we bow, we stand with face and hands uplifted. There is no creature before whom we are bowing, before whom we are kneeling, before whom we are standing. We are bowing, kneeling, and standing with face and hands uplifted before God.</p>\n<p>This is close to identifying that mode of acknowledging God\u2019s excellence that constitutes worship but not quite there yet. A theologian, oriented toward God, might discourse about the excellence of God, thereby acknowledging the excellence of God; but that would not be worship of God. Why not? What is missing?</p>\n<p>What is missing is a certain <i>attitudinal stance </i>of the person toward God. The heart of that that attitudinal stance, I would say, is adoration. Worship of God is adoration of God. One can stand in adoration of many things, however, not just of God \u2013 of a landscape, for example. The worship of God is a distinct kind of adoration. At its core in the Christian tradition are awe, reverence, and gratitude. Christian worship is that Godward mode of acknowledging God\u2019s excellence whose attitudinal stance is awed, reverential, and grateful adoration.</p>\n<h2>Awe and horror in the practice of scholarship</h2>\n<p>In conclusion, let me repeat what I made in concluding my brief initial response to Biggar\u2019s Theology Brief. Toward the end of his Brief, Biggar mentions some of the virtues that should characterize the work of Christian scholars. I suggest that, given the presence, rightly emphasized by Biggar, of both embodied goodness and embodied evil in the world, there should be, in addition to the virtues mentioned, two sorts of emotions that Christian scholars experience in the course their work: the emotion of <i>awe </i>before the intricacy and immensity of God\u2019s creation, and before the ability of human beings to understand something of that intricacy and immensity and their ability themselves to create things of supreme worth, and the emotion of <i>horror </i>when considering what human beings have done to each other, to God\u2019s creation, and to the Creator. There is something seriously deficient in Christian scholars who never experience such awe or such horror in the course of their work.</p>\n<h2 class=\"new_page\">Further Reading</h2>\n<p>Adams, Robert, <i>Finite and Infinite Goods </i>(Oxford: Oxford University Press, 1999).

In this disciplinary note, I would like to focus on the link between the objective order of nature and our subjective understanding thereof \u2014an assumption that, according to Prof. Biggar, \u201cis basic to the natural sciences and should be basic to all academic endeavor.\u201d\n\nFirst, let me introduce a famous quote from Einstein in a letter to his friend Maurice Solovine regarding the order we humans perceive in the universe.\n\n\u201cYou find it strange that I consider the comprehensibility of the world (to the extent that we are authorized to speak of such a comprehensibility) as a miracle or as an eternal mystery. Well, a priori one should expect a chaotic world which cannot be grasped by the mind in any way. One could (yes one should) expect the world to be subjected to law only to the extent that we order it through our intelligence. Ordering of this kind would be like the alphabetical ordering of the words of a language. By contrast, the kind of order created by Newton\u2019s theory of gravitation, for instance, is wholly different. Even if the axioms of the theory are proposed by man, the success of such a project presupposes a high degree of ordering of the objective world, and this could not be expected a priori. That is the \u2018miracle\u2019 which is being constantly reinforced as our knowledge expands.\u201d (A. Einstein, Letters to Solovine, translated by Wade Baskin, with an introduction by Maurice Solovine (New York: Philosophical Library, 1987), pp. 132-133; see https://inters.org/Einstein-Letter-Solovine )\n\nThe realism of Einstein\u2019s position drives him to speak about the miracle or the eternal mystery that the intelligibility of nature, not created by the human mind, evokes. As is well known, such order did not bring him to admit the existence of a personal God. By contrast, let me quote a less-known reflection of Benedict XVI on the same topic.\n\n\u201cMathematics, as such, is a creation of our intelligence: the correspondence between its structures and the real structures of the universe \u2014which is the presupposition of all modern scientific and technological developments, already expressly formulated by Galileo Galilei with the famous affirmation that the book of nature is written in mathematical language\u2014 arouses our admiration and raises a big question. It implies, in fact, that the universe itself is structured in an intelligent manner, such that a profound correspondence exists between our subjective reason and the objective reason in nature. It then becomes inevitable to ask oneself if there might not be a single original intelligence that is the common font of them both. Thus, precisely the reflection on the development of science brings us towards the creator Logos.\u201d (Benedict XVI, Address to the Fourth National Ecclesial Convention in Verona, 19 October 2006; see https://www.vatican.va/content/benedict-xvi/en/speeches/2006/october/documents/hf_ben-xvi_spe_20061019_convegno-verona.html )\n\nBeyond the intrinsic interest of these two quotes, both reflect a different attitude regarding the correspondence between the objective order of nature and our natural reason \u2014as manifested, e.g., by physical theories describing, even if partially, the world. Prof Biggar assumes that \u201cthe created world reflects the coherence, the rationality, the beauty, the order of the Creator (\u2026) and so, in principle, intelligible by human minds or \u2018rational.\u2019\u201d Of course, faith in a rational Creator warrants the order of nature and the possibility of grasping it by rational beings created in the image and likeness of their Creator. However, the opposite is not necessarily true, namely, that intelligibility of the universe drives towards the acceptance of a personal Creator. Einstein and many other contemporary scientists do not believe in a personal God. Why is that so? Is the ultimate answer about the origin of the order of nature just a matter of naked faith, irrelevant for natural scientists, or is there anything that Benedict XVI\u2019s quote is saying to Einstein, who stops his reasoning on the miracle of intelligibility and rejects further epistemic commitments?\n\nMy answer leans towards the second possibility, as Benedict XVI has constantly defended the rationality of the Christian faith. The fundamental dilemma that Benedict XVI poses to natural scientists \u2014and all human beings\u2014 is the following: if at the origin of the world we find ourselves before the logos-reason or, on the contrary, an irrational mystery. Let me illustrate this claim with some exemplary quotes extremely relevant to all scholars, particularly natural scientists:\n\n\u201cIn the end, to reach the definitive question I would say: God exists or he does not exist. There are only two options. Either one recognizes the priority of reason, of creative Reason that is at the beginning of all things and is the principle of all things \u2014the priority of reason is also the priority of freedom\u2014, or one holds the priority of the irrational, inasmuch as everything that functions on our earth and in our lives would be only accidental, marginal, an irrational result \u2014reason would be a product of irrationality.\u201d (Benedict XVI, Encounter With the Youth, 6 April 2006; see https://www.vatican.va/content/benedict-xvi/en/speeches/2006/april/documents/hf_ben-xvi_spe_20060406_xxi-wyd.html )\n\n\u201cModern scientific reason quite simply has to accept the rational structure of matter and the correspondence between our spirit and the prevailing rational structures of nature as a given, on which its methodology has to be based. Yet the question why this has to be so is a real question, and one which has to be remanded by the natural sciences to other modes and planes of thought \u2014to philosophy and theology.\u201d (Benedict XVI, Meeting with the Representatives of science, 12 September 2006; see https://www.vatican.va/content/benedict-xvi/en/speeches/2006/september/documents/hf_ben-xvi_spe_20060912_university-regensburg.html )\n\n\u201c[T]he issue is clearly whether or not reason stands at the beginning and foundation of all things. The issue is whether reality originates by chance and necessity, and thus whether reason is merely a chance by-product of the irrational and, in an ocean of irrationality, it too, in the end, is meaningless, or whether instead the underlying conviction of Christian faith remains true: In principio erat Verbum \u2014in the beginning was the Word; at the origin of everything is the creative reason of God who decided to make himself known to us human beings.\u201d (Benedict XVI, Meeting with the Authorities and the Diplomatic Corps, 7 September 2007; see https://www.vatican.va/content/benedict-xvi/en/speeches/2007/september/documents/hf_ben-xvi_spe_20070907_hofburg-wien.html )\n\nIn other words, whereas intelligibility of the universe remains a cipher for non-believers, as a sort of end-station for rational thinking, believers may still invoke the Augustinian intellectus quaerens fidem to move forward in their bet for rationality and order. True, opting for a Creator is still a bet because nobody can provide a logical demonstration of the existence of a personal God. Yet such a bet is rational, as its content offers epistemic continuity between the order of the universe, human reason, and the eventual origin of both. Inference to the best explanation or abduction should play a role here. Even though priors and their probabilistic weight can be very different for each human being, in particular natural scientists, I think that this argument is sufficiently strong to overrule many of them.\n\nNo doubt, one die-hard positivist and non-believer could still reject the initial premise of this discussion, namely, the existence of a natural order of things. The appearance of such order would merely reflect an imposition by human reason on an otherwise meaningless universe. We have seen how Einstein strongly rejected such a stance. But, even worse, I hesitate that denying the objective existence of order improves the odds for non-believers, as it manifestly introduces an unbridgeable hiatus between the ontological order of nature and the epistemic order of human reason and cancels all objective grounding of moral order. The origin of human reason thus becomes a grander mystery for negationists of the order of nature.\n\nTo sum up, the objective order of the universe, beyond grounding for moral order, additionally offers grounding for an updated version of Pascal\u2019s wager: \u201cPascal argues that a rational person should live as though God exists and seek to believe in God. If God does not exist, such a person will have only a finite loss [\u2026], whereas if God does exist, he stands to receive infinite gains (as represented by eternity in Heaven) and avoid infinite losses (an eternity in Hell).\u201d (See https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pascal%27s_wager#cite_note-2 ). Now the bet is not about personal gain but about rationality itself. Having introduced the positions epitomized by Benedict XVI and Einstein, I thus submit to the reader\u2019s judgment the assessment of which one should be deemed more rational and potentially conducive to progress in the human understanding of the world.",

True, opting for a Creator is still a bet because nobody can provide a logical demonstration of the existence of a personal God. Yet such a bet is rational, as its content offers epistemic continuity between the order of the universe, human reason, and the eventual origin of both. Inference to the best explanation or abduction should play a role here. Even though priors and their probabilistic weight can be very different for each human being, in particular natural scientists, I think that this argument is sufficiently strong to overrule many of them.</p>\n<p>No doubt, one die-hard positivist and non-believer could still reject the initial premise of this discussion, namely, the existence of a natural order of things. The appearance of such order would merely reflect an imposition by human reason on an otherwise meaningless universe. We have seen how Einstein strongly rejected such a stance. But, even worse, I hesitate that denying the objective existence of order improves the odds for non-believers, as it manifestly introduces an unbridgeable hiatus between the ontological order of nature and the epistemic order of human reason and cancels all objective grounding of moral order. The origin of human reason thus becomes a grander mystery for negationists of the order of nature.</p>\n<p>To sum up, the objective order of the universe, beyond grounding for moral order, additionally offers grounding for an updated version of Pascal\u2019s wager: \u201cPascal argues that a rational person should live as though God exists and seek to believe in God. If God does not exist, such a person will have only a finite loss [\u2026], whereas if God does exist, he stands to receive infinite gains (as represented by eternity in Heaven) and avoid infinite losses (an eternity in Hell).\u201d (See <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pascal%27s_wager#cite_note-2\">https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pascal%27s_wager#cite_note-2</a>). Now the bet is not about personal gain but about rationality itself. Having introduced the positions epitomized by Benedict XVI and Einstein, I thus submit to the reader\u2019s judgment the assessment of which one should be deemed more rational and potentially conducive to progress in the human understanding of the world.</p>"

    "bodyText": "Nigel Biggar has made a fine statement of the actuality and character of created order, and the way it relates to moral order. His stress on the pervasiveness of morality through creation, and of the way of life which this implies for politics, international relations, and the academy, is both winning and timely.\n\nBut first, what is Order? It appears to be a slippery term, skating across a range of categories in Biggar\u2019s discussion without tight definition. However, I find myself similarly unrigorous as I reflect on the concept, it is proving difficult to give it substance without tautology. It has to do with structure and pattern and system, terms which are fundamental, for example, in linguists\u2019 approaches to language. But I am unsure that this adds much clarity, so at this point I will hope that other parties to this exchange will have the perception to offer a more consistent and compassing definition. I will simply note my sense that we cannot go directly from an idea that \u2018creation is orderly\u2019 to the idea that \u2018society is orderly\u2019.\n\nThere are two issues I want to raise in relation to Order. Firstly, I believe complementing the principle of \u2018order\u2019 with an awareness of the profusion of creation would yield a fuller understanding of creation. It is possible, it seems to me, to overstate the orderliness of creation. From Genesis onwards, creation is also about profusion as well as about orderliness \u2013 and not just because of human sin and failing. So many biblical texts, particularly in the Psalms, testify to the overwhelming, untamed profusion of God\u2019s creation. While order may be one basic dimension of creation, abundance - even to excess, even to the extent of dis order - is another. That is, I am not sure that we want to end up saying that orderliness is next to godliness. As Biggar observes, creation order includes quantum randomness and artistic improvisation.\n\nAs both academics and Christians, we are committed to seeking the orderliness in what we study, but of course, ultimate answers to that evade us. There is much in creation which is not orderly in any clear sense - and was it ever intended to be so? It is overflowing, messy, abandoned in ways which especially the Old Testament scriptures convey. The a-rationality of David\u2019s dance before the Lord, and of the lovers of the Song of Songs, overwhelm notions of orderliness. Too much emphasis on the orderliness of creation, I find, both underestimates God, and risks affirming a modernist, empiricist approach to our understanding of the world. To me, \u2018rational\u2019 is too potentially reductionist a term to want to apply it to creation, or as a characterization of humanity. Rationality is part of our nature, but so also is imagination and its fruits. Perhaps postmodernism\u2019s stress on disorder has something to offer our thinking here, however we may wish to challenge other aspects of it.\n\nOrderliness can too easily be equated with tidiness. There is a certain variegated uncertainty about humanity and creation \u2013 and God. The Old Testament, in all its ambiguity, rainbow diversity, paradox and sheer bitsiness conveys an important truth about the God whose creation is beyond ordering. I think God threw some things out there to be wildly manifold and productive like a rainforest or an estuary or a galaxy. That same unfettered variety is a core characteristic of language - that human creation which the prologue to John\u2019s Gospel indicates is a reflection of the character of God\u2019s creation itself.\n\nHere I am reminded of a passage from C S Lewis\u2019s The Lion, the Witch and the Wardrobe in which the children ask whether Aslan \u2013 the Christ-figure \u2013 is safe. \u2018 \u2018Course he isn\u2019t safe\u2019, comes the answer, \u2018But he\u2019s good\u2019 Lewis 1980: 87). Perhaps like Christ the irrepressible Word, creation may be Good without being safely ordered.\n\nWe can see this idea of profusion-beyond-order in the field of linguistics (Bell 2014). Much \u2013 indeed, most \u2013 of language is orderly, and can be described and catalogued in its patterns, although our models remain partial and provisional. Whereas most people (including academics in other fields) tend to think of language as primarily words, linguists see it in terms of structures and systems (of grammar, sounds, meanings) \u2013 effectively in terms of order. But all of language is rife with exceptions and one-off forms which will never be knocked into neatness by our descriptions. In addition, the infinity of combinations which a language offers within its structures is testament to the boundlessness of the creativity it provides.\n\nLanguage is a site of continuous flux, it just never stops changing amidst the swirl of linguistic production and creation. It is always spinning new words, structures, dialects, styles, genres, accents \u2013 and it is that creative volatility which represents much of the delight of language. If this is so for a human (sub)creation such as language, it holds even more for God\u2019s creation as a whole, and the Good which God delights in includes the flux as well as the order of it.\n\nConsider humans\u2019 ability to birth new languages out of old ones. In circumstances where diverse speakers are thrown together who share no common language, they will immediately begin to create a new code of communication from the resources available to them. This is the origin of the world\u2019s youngest languages, the creoles of the Caribbean and the Pacific. These were born out of the cruelty and exploitation which was the labour and slave trades of the 18th and 19 th centuries. Taking their vocabulary from the dominant language, and their grammar from their own languages, these peoples created communicative codes which, within a couple of generations, would develop the structures and usages of a fully-fledged language. Soon children would grow up as native speakers, and some of these codes now serve as national languages - like Bislama in Vanuatu, little more than a century after it came into existence.\n\nConsider also the rife multilingualism of traditional peoples everywhere, with three, four or more languages regularly in play in their communities. And the rampant multilingualism of the contemporary young European, able to speak French, German, English, Spanish or Italian at need. To those of us for whom Anglo-American monolingualism is a default, such variety and facility is bewildering, even alien in its productivity. But it is a reminder that most of the world is and always has been multilingual \u2013 including probably Jesus, located at the intersection of Hebrew, Aramaic and Greek. It is also a reminder that the sin of Babel (Genesis 11) can be understood as the people\u2019s refusal to disperse throughout the earth, and that multilingualism was not a curse but a blessing that compelled them to do so and thus to fulfil their creation mandate (Bell 2013).\n\nLastly, consider the ability of microscopically fine differences in language to index different identities. A single word may place a speaker as from elsewhere, and infinitesimal differences in pronouncing just one vowel may proclaim that I am from a different country or social group. As argued by the Soviet-era thinker Mikhail Bakhtin (1981, 1986) \u2013 philosopher, linguist, unorthodox Orthodox Christian - language has an unquenchable centrifugal impetus, forever flying apart into variegated forms, each of which has its own linguistic character and social flavour. And the centripetal forces of standardization - academies, dictionaries, pundits, educators - cannot tame that kaleidoscopic fruitfulness. Nor should they, since the productivity of language is simply a reflection of the fertility of creation.\n\nSecondly, too much emphasis on order, to my mind, runs the risk of leading to an alignment of Christianity with sociopolitical conservatism. The church has a long and often unfortunate history of co-option to the status quo which is at severe odds with the teaching of the Jesus who is its founder and lord. I think we can justifiably argue that Jesus\u2019 mission had a strong strand of disordering built into it. This was prefigured at his conception in the words of Mary\u2019s Magnificat (Luke 1: 46-55, NRSV):\n\nHe has scattered the proud in the thoughts of their hearts. He has brought down the powerful from their thrones, and lifted up the lowly.\n\nHere social order is inverted, rulers are displaced and the marginalized moved to the centre. Such reversal doesn\u2019t happen without some degree of disorder.\n\nTo a couple of specifics: Biggar\u2019s evaluation of postwar youth rebellion identifies its primary target as traditional Christian sexual morality. The mid-to-late 20 th century youth movements have always represented a much broader challenge to established society, and Christians can endorse at least some of that. When \u2018the times are a-changing\u2019, Christians should not be seen to line up automatically against what is new. Calls for integrity in political life, for racial or gender equity, for the waging of peace instead of war are closer to the spirit of the Gospel than are their opposites. You only need to go back to John Osborne\u2019s seminal 1956 play Look Back in Anger to see that youth rebellion has had deep roots and society-wide targets since its beginnings.\n\nSimilarly, the feminisms of the past 60 years, or 40 years of postmodernisms, can be the source of self-critical learning and not just of reaction. Modernism and empiricism \u2013 enshrined in mid-20 th -century functionalism in the social sciences \u2013 needed the challenge which late-20 th -century postmodernism addressed to them. The orderliness of those earlier paradigms had less to do with any Christian sense of God\u2019s order than with under-examined social conservatism. The tendency of postmodernism to over-balance towards agency in the structure~agency continuum should not mask the over-emphasis on structure which preceded it (Carter & Sealey 2000). The Christian scholar can learn from both.\n\nBiggar\u2019s long section on social hierarchy invites a question. In the context of a discussion of slavery, he concludes: \u2018Functional hierarchy is morally unobjectionable, so long as functional superiors regard functional inferiors fraternally\u2019. I am sure Biggar will not want to be heard as reprising the 19 th -century arguments against Wilberforce and his companion slavery reformers: \u2018slavery is fine as long as owners are nice to their slaves\u2019.\n\nWe can observe in our time that one of the notable fruits of national Covid lockdowns was that we learned that the really essential workers of our society are those at the bottom of the hierarchy (and the pay scale): shelf stackers, rubbish collectors, cleaners, drivers. Unfortunately that is a lesson we have been quick to unlearn now the lockdowns have passed. How, then, do we value social hierarchy where it matters, in creative tension with the subversive teaching of Jesus and the epistles?\n\nThe good-news-to-the-poor which Jesus announced at the start of his mission has its repercussions for society as a whole. The blessings of the Beatitudes come, in Luke\u2019s telling (6: 20-26, NRSV), at the cost of woes upon the satisfied and the dominant:\n\nBlessed are you who are poor, for yours is the kingdom of God. Blessed are you who are hungry now, for you will be filled\u2026\n\nBut woe to you who are rich, for you have received your consolation. Woe to you who are full now, for you will be hungry.\n\nSo many of Jesus\u2019 parables bespeak a radical disruption of the established order. And his deliberate and eventually deadly confrontation with the powers of his time and place initiated a transformation which was nothing short of upheaval.\n\nLet us embrace the fruitfulness of disorder as well as of order.\n\nBakhtin, M.

The blessings of the Beatitudes come, in Luke\u2019s telling (6: 20-26, NRSV), at the cost of woes upon the satisfied and the dominant:</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>Blessed are you who are poor,<br/>\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 for yours is the kingdom of God.<br/>\nBlessed are you who are hungry now,<br/>\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 for you will be filled\u2026</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>Blessed are you who are poor,<br/>\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 for yours is the kingdom of God.<br/>\nBlessed are you who are hungry now,<br/>\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 for you will be filled\u2026</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>But woe to you who are rich,<br/>\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 for you have received your consolation.<br/>\nWoe to you who are full now,<br/>\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 for you will be hungry.</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>But woe to you who are rich,<br/>\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 for you have received your consolation.<br/>\nWoe to you who are full now,<br/>\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 for you will be hungry.</p>\n<p>So many of Jesus\u2019 parables bespeak a radical disruption of the established order. And his deliberate and eventually deadly confrontation with the powers of his time and place initiated a transformation which was nothing short of upheaval.</p>\n<p>Let us embrace the fruitfulness of disorder as well as of order.</p>\n<h2 class=\"new_page\">References</h2>\n<p>Bakhtin, M.

    "bodyText": "I specialize in legal orders such as the laws and institutions that govern taxation or human rights or finance or crime or the climate or the environment\u2014indeed, almost any sphere of human life and behavior. In this essay, I explore implications of Nigel\u2019s Biggar\u2019s evocative account of moral and social orders for scholars who study legal change, and in my case, the dynamics of transnational legal orders (TLOs). Almost every aspect of 21 st century social orders are shaped by law, and domestic legal orders are almost always embedded to some degree or other in transnational orders that span national frontiers and weave together persons, institutions and states across regions and the world. These orders are constantly undergoing change, as they rise or fall, remain adaptive and vibrant, or become fragile and marginal.\n\nI make two arguments in this Brief. First, a certain kind of disorder is integral to the viability of legal orders, and by extension, other social orders. Second, that the created moral order, as depicted by Biggar, will have a disturbing effect on current legal orders, effectively shaking them up in ways that induce social disorder insofar as they are impelled to conform to a higher good. I will illustrate the interplay of chaos, disorder and order in one of my research domains\u2014the laws that govern business failures. I conclude with observations on empirical research as a companion to ethical reflections and with puzzles that remain for me if I seek to bring my social science research into meaningful conformity with Biggar\u2019s theological ethics. In so doing I seek to extrapolate from Biggar\u2019s characterization of the created moral order as \u201cnot a silent, barren thing, but [it] contains\u2014both limiting and including\u2014plurality, vitality, and freedom. God\u2019s order is not dead; it is dynamic.\u201d\n\nIn research on legal change, we observe order and disorder in a dynamic tension. Studies of transnational legal orders point to facilitating circumstances and precipitating events that press individuals, or industries, or states, or international organizations to create or reform an order. Sometimes change comes from outside an order: contexts change; alternative orders present competitive challenges; economic or social or political shocks trigger responses. Sometimes changes come from within an order: its internal organization may become rigid or brittle or irrelevant, or it no longer solves the problems for which it was initially designed. In the worlds of transnational legal orders, globalization and its discontents, the outbreaks of pandemics, the collapse of supply chains, the horrors of starvation and civil war, are among but a few of the disorders and disturbances that we observe when sets of facilitating circumstances suddenly explode and trigger calls for new or reformed orders. The Russian invasion of Ukraine, and China\u2019s erosion of the post WWII international legal order, are prime cases in point.\n\nWe can go a step further and argue that a vibrant social or legal order requires constant disturbance as a dynamic of adaptation. [\u00a01\u00a0] Some degree of disorder becomes an essential condition, perhaps a force, for legal change. It might be styled as a moving equilibrium. Sometimes it may be purposefully induced by reformers, rights activists, campaigners, and on the international stage, by states or international governmental or civil society organizations, who identify a besetting problem and raise their voices in calls for change, very often, almost always, through some kind of law. Sometimes it is precipitated by the cruelty or narcissism or hubris of rulers who seek to domesticate or dismantle orders that limit their arbitrary power\u2014consider Xi Jinping of China, or Viktor Orban of Hungary\u2014or demand redress for harms committed against their own or adjacent populations.\n\nIn market economies, many businesses fail. When they can no longer pay their bills, business enterprises can leave a trail of woes\u2014unpaid workers, tax payments in arrears, pension funds hollowed out, suppliers out of pocket for goods they delivered, bankers who lent money that is not repaid, investors with moneys depreciated or lost. Assets of equipment or land or buildings or goodwill are not worth enough to pay off creditors in full or make investors whole.\n\nUntil the later twentieth century, business failure met with two responses. [\u00a02\u00a0] One was simply to leave the mess of the economic collapse to the informal processes of a market. The result was too often akin to chaos, an economic war of all against all, where the creditors, those owed money, scrambled to be the first to grab assets and the powerful and elbowed out the weak. Another was to regularize, make orderly through law, the liquidation of a firm. A failing firm could be sold and taken over by a successful firm. Or, a business could be broken up, all its assets sold, and the moneys from the sales used to pay off, usually at a steep discount, those other businesses or the state or workers that were owed money. The orderly approach is the realm of corporate bankruptcy or insolvency law and institutions.\n\nBy the late 1960s and early 1970s a rising level of dissatisfaction in the U.S., and then the United Kingdom, pointed to the economic inefficiencies and unfairness of liquidation as a governing principle, and liquidation law and practice in everyday life. In 1976 the US Congress enacted a Corporate Bankruptcy Code, followed a decade later, by the English Insolvency Act, 1986 (Carruthers and Halliday 1998). While both pieces of legislation diverged in certain respects, both also represented a fundamental shift in legal change. The new laws advocated an ideal of rehabilitation and reorganization. Business managers or professionals could invoke the new laws to give the firm some breathing space, to hold creditors at bay, to restructure finances with a new business plan, to obtain new financing, to reorganize the firm. All these steps, it was thought, would save jobs, preserve more value for creditors, and rescue businesses. Properly restructured, a firm could re-enter the market better equipped to compete within it.\n\nThe influential shifts from a liquidation to reorganization philosophy of business failure in the US and England pointed to an alternative order, but it took massive disorder to precipitate widespread legal change. The 1990s debt crises in Russia and Mexico, and then the Asian Financial Crisis, fundamentally challenged the completeness and efficacy of the prevailing corporate bankruptcy systems in most countries, shocks that revealed and magnified the disorderliness of dealing with companies in distress. In 1987 and 1988 several of the \u201cAsian Tiger\u201d economies collapsed. The International Monetary Fund and World Bank, together with the US and other major economies, coupled a massive infusion of funds to stabilize financial collapse in South Korea and Indonesia, among others, with drastic and often draconian \u201cconditionalities\u201d for change in their financial institutions. To forestall future financial crises, the World Bank and IMF pressed countries to construct robust corporate bankruptcy systems in which reorganization or rehabilitation was a governing principle.\n\nFrom the late 1980s, the G-22 and at least four international organizations\u2014the IMF, World Bank, OECD and the UN--worked with major professional associations of lawyers, accountants, and insolvency practitioners, to formulate a new legal order. Ultimately, the UN Commission on International Trade Law (UNCITRAL) took the lead as a quasi, non-binding global legislature, first creating a Legislative Guide for Insolvency, and following it up with a series of other model and soft laws (Block-Lieb and Halliday 2017). The World Bank and IMF added pressure for countries to reform their laws, often in the course of Article IV reviews and as a condition of lending. Over the past twenty years these laws have been adopted in part or whole by scores of countries, and has influenced legal harmonization efforts in the European Union. In effect, the magnitude of disorder displayed by the Asian Tigers, and later the 2008 Global Financial Crisis, triggered legal change on a global scale. These propelled creation of a global legal order that has gradually taken hold in the early 21 st century.\n\nAlready, within political rhetoric (cf. Mrs. Thatcher\u2019s campaign in the UK to \u201cclean up markets\u201d), and amongst scholars, a notion of the morality of markets emerged since the 1990s on the law and institutions of corporate bankruptcy regimes (Carruthers and Halliday 1996) and thereafter more widely in economic sociology. But this concern with morality had no seeming connection with the created moral order as Biggar portrays it.\n\nIf a morality of markets can be observed within the social science enterprise itself, Biggar would subsume this morality, and all the social behaviors it orders, into a transcendent moral hierarchy that situates created order at its apex. This is a recipe for social disorder. In effect, when the created order comes into contact with a legal or social order, the friction of the two, perhaps always, will produce disorder in extant legal orders. If a current legal order is held accountable to the norms of the created order, it will be subject to \u201cprophetic criticism.\u201d The assumptions, veneers and practices of a given legal order will be exposed, revealing its moral inadequacies and ethical shortcomings. The sociolegal scholar attuned to the ideals of God\u2019s moral order will point to mismatches between those ideals and the law on the books and law in action. That scholar will consistently ask: does the law produce the practices consistent with the created order? This stance of accountability therefore introduces moral disturbance to legal orders and thus acts as a motor of legal change. But what standards does Biggar propose?\n\nFor Biggar, a benevolent created order produces a range of \u201cgoods,\u201d material and immaterial, that produces human flourishing. In Biggar\u2019s terms, any legal order, including corporate insolvency systems, will be measured against ultimate ethical values, including justice, moral integrity, and charity. He also identifies what we might call processual values. To remain responsive to material needs and immaterial values a legal order will display \u201cplurality, vitality and freedom.\u201d\n\nSome of the processual values can be observed in corporate insolvency systems when laws, regulations and institutions stimulate the economic creativity of market players\u2014inventors, business startups, suppliers, investors. Indeed, disturbance of an extant sclerotic bankruptcy system can be produced precisely to compel current actors to break out of their conventional ways of doing business and to open up new spaces for innovation. Assets that are declining in value can be brought into a new financial reorganization with new moneys and new management to renew a firm\u2019s viability. Lawmakers and market actors, therefore, in Biggar\u2019s vision, are called to stewardship of human and financial resources as they work alongside each other to construct ethical and effective market institutions through law.\n\nClearly, the example of corporate bankruptcy orders is a microcosm of a larger challenge. For any social order the Christian social scientist will require the aid and partnership of a theologian and ethicist to bring the biblical and theological, doctrine and abstract ideals, that are sharply pointed enough to disturb current legal and social orders and propel them to deliver the goods and ends of flourishing which the created moral order impels.\n\nIf master ethical criteria for a good legal order are the production of human flourishing and adherence to higher order theological ideals of justice, charity and freedom, then the question immediately arises\u2014how do we know what kinds of laws produce these goods? It is a verity of sociolegal research that good intentions don\u2019t always produce good laws, and good laws don\u2019t always result in good outcomes. A gap invariability opens up between laws-on-the-books and law-in-action.\n\nBiggar implicitly issues a vocational calling, even a research agenda, for the Christian sociologist and empirical legal scholar. In my scholarship on transnational legal orders, I am therefore called to ask\u2014what empirical evidence is that a given legal concept or law or regulation will deliver goods that produce flourishing? [\u00a03\u00a0] What kind of lawmakers and lawmaking processes will ensure that evidence, not ignorance, will drive policy and lawmaking (Halliday 2018)? It appears to me that the ethicist and social scientist must be working together, as complementary disciplines. One elaborates the ideals of a Godly moral order. Legal and social science scholars on law will deploy these yardsticks to discover if laws and legal regulations, market and legal institutions, measure up to those ideals. Such an interdependency of endeavor elevates the work of a social scientist beyond empirical research and theory-building into another realm a Christian scholarly calling.\n\nPut another way, Biggar points to a two-directional move for the Christian scholar on legal orders. In one direction, s/he compares and contrasts TLO ideals with created order ideals. In the other direction, s/he discovers whether the ideals in practice produce goods and human flourishing. This benefits the social science enterprise itself. Contingent social theory will identify what prevents or facilitates the implementation of the ideals articulated in a Christian moral order. Not least, as Biggar writes elsewhere, strong empirical foundations are necessary for theological ethics to be well grounded.\n\nAs social scientists we can distinguish between two form of disorder in legal change.\n\nDisjunctive disorder most visibly takes the form of exogenous shocks external to an institution or state. A massive oil spill, an economic crisis, atrocities, a pandemic, can highlight the inadequacies of current orders and precipitate a movement towards a whole new episode of legal change, even the construction of a new legal order in a domain of finance or commerce or human rights or the environment, among others. These shocks may border on chaos in their unpredictability and irrationality.\n\nBy contrast, there is a form of constitutive disorder which is integral to the dynamics of everyday adaptation and almost imperceptible change. Here the inner workings of a legal or social order, their faults and failures, propel responses which more or less, sooner or later, can shift the order in a more effective direction, however \u201ceffective\u201d is defined. Here the outer contexts of an order, the slow changes in economic, social and political circumstances, also propel a legal order to change, to adapt the current order in ways that deliver the goods, moral and material, for which the order was constructed (cf. \u0007\u0003(Mahoney and Thelen 2010)\b.\n\nBiggar compounds the already evident forms of disjunctive and constitutive disorder in legal and social institutions by inducing another kind of disturbance\u2014the critique, counterpoint and inspiration of a Christian moral order that offers a distinctive vision of a good social or legal order. In so doing, the ideals of the created moral order contribute constructively to a dismantling or reconstruction of present orders.\n\nIn the spirit of dialogue, however, can what we know about social and legal orders speak back to understandings of moral orders? I have already raised the challenge of specifying high level doctrinal and theological ethics sufficiently to provide some precision for application to social and legal orders. Other questions remain.\n\nFirst, how much disorder is there within created moral orders? Within the scriptures, and across schools of thought in the Christian tradition, we observe differing conceptions of which ideals should be given primacy, both as derivations from scripture and doctrinal principles, and in applications to different places and times in biblical and Christian history. How is the Christian social scientist to discern what kinds of disorder should be induced in current institutions and what principles of order should replace them? Dialogue across the theological/disciplinary divide seems imperative.\n\nSecond, it seems that social orders not infrequently in the history of the church have induced revisions in the application of ideals to social institutions. Consider the democratic revolutions that overturn medieval presumptions about political order. Or, the rise of women\u2019s movements since the 19 th Century and their implications for the dignity of women, not least their roles in church leadership. Or, the effect of a sexual revolution on some branches of churches\u2019 moral orders on homosexuality. Does disruption of legal and social orders have a dynamic effect on disordering and then reordering understandings of the created moral order, insofar as we see through a glass darkly?\n\nThird, should our understandings of created order reflect something of the uncertainties, approximations, and limitations evident in the construction and adaptation of legal and social orders? Must some of the contingency, even humility, that requires partial corrections and adjustments in social orders be also acknowledged in the expressions of created order insofar as they are crafted by fallen thinkers, themselves shaped by social and historical contexts with their brokenness and flaws?\n\nFourth, do the extent that legal and social orders always display gaps between their designers and outcomes, is there an element of moral contingency that any given set of standards and rules derived from higher-order ideals might be altered if their application in practice proves to be counter-productive, even subversive?\n\nBlock-Lieb, Susan, and Terence C.

But this concern with morality had no seeming connection with the created moral order as Biggar portrays it.</p>\n<h3>Creative Moral Order Disturbances for Legal Change</h3>\n<p>If a morality of markets can be observed within the social science enterprise itself, Biggar would subsume this morality, and all the social behaviors it orders, into a transcendent moral hierarchy that situates created order at its apex. This is a recipe for social disorder. In effect, when the created order comes into contact with a legal or social order, the friction of the two, perhaps always, will produce disorder in extant legal orders. If a current legal order is held accountable to the norms of the created order, it will be subject to \u201cprophetic criticism.\u201d The assumptions, veneers and practices of a given legal order will be exposed, revealing its moral inadequacies and ethical shortcomings. The sociolegal scholar attuned to the ideals of God\u2019s moral order will point to mismatches between those ideals and the law on the books and law in action. That scholar will consistently ask: does the law produce the practices consistent with the created order? This stance of accountability therefore introduces moral disturbance to legal orders and thus acts as a motor of legal change. But what standards does Biggar propose?</p>\n<h3>Towards Goods and Flourishing</h3>\n<p>For Biggar, a benevolent created order produces a range of \u201cgoods,\u201d material and immaterial, that produces human flourishing. In Biggar\u2019s terms, any legal order, including corporate insolvency systems, will be measured against <i>ultimate</i> ethical values, including justice, moral integrity, and charity. He also identifies what we might call <i>processual </i>values. To remain responsive to material needs and immaterial values a legal order will display \u201cplurality, vitality and freedom.\u201d</p>\n<p>Some of the processual values can be observed in corporate insolvency systems when laws, regulations and institutions stimulate the economic creativity of market players\u2014inventors, business startups, suppliers, investors. Indeed, disturbance of an extant sclerotic bankruptcy system can be produced precisely to compel current actors to break out of their conventional ways of doing business and to open up new spaces for innovation. Assets that are declining in value can be brought into a new financial reorganization with new moneys and new management to renew a firm\u2019s viability. Lawmakers and market actors, therefore, in Biggar\u2019s vision, are called to stewardship of human and financial resources as they work alongside each other to construct ethical and effective market institutions through law.</p>\n<p>While it is fairly straightforward to identify material benefits of an economic legal order, the immaterial and ultimate values present more of a challenge. One approach might be to hold the ethics of players in failing businesses and bankruptcy systems to the virtues that Biggar identifies, such as humility, critical self-reflection, and openness to correction. Others, such as prudence and charity can also come into play. However, the ultimate values of the created order identified by Biggar, such as justice, require explicit reasoning that derives and specifies the abstract value into applications for specific rules and laws, regulations and institutions. While clearly beyond Biggar\u2019s remit in this Theology Brief, a <i>Christian </i>theological ethics of corporate bankruptcy orders will need to weigh such values as forgiveness with fairness, economic power with economic vulnerability, reward for effort with reward for innovation.</p>\n<p>Clearly, the example of corporate bankruptcy orders is a microcosm of a larger challenge. For any social order the Christian social scientist will require the aid and partnership of a theologian and ethicist to bring the biblical and theological, doctrine and abstract ideals, that are sharply pointed enough to disturb current legal and social orders and propel them to deliver the goods and ends of flourishing which the created moral order impels.</p>\n<h2>Empirics</h2>\n<p>If master ethical criteria for a good legal order are the production of human flourishing and adherence to higher order theological ideals of justice, charity and freedom, then the question immediately arises\u2014how do we know what kinds of laws produce these goods? It is a verity of sociolegal research that good intentions don\u2019t always produce good laws, and good laws don\u2019t always result in good outcomes. A gap invariability opens up between laws-on-the-books and law-in-action.</p>\n<p>Biggar implicitly issues a vocational calling, even a research agenda, for the Christian sociologist and empirical legal scholar. In my scholarship on transnational legal orders, I am therefore called to ask\u2014what empirical evidence is that a given legal concept or law or regulation will deliver goods that produce flourishing?<a class=\"anchor\" id=\"content100note3anc\" name=\"content100note3anc\">\u00a0</a><a class=\"note\" href=\"#content100note3sym\">[\u00a03\u00a0]</a> What kind of lawmakers and lawmaking processes will ensure that evidence, not ignorance, will drive policy and lawmaking (Halliday 2018)? It appears to me that the ethicist and social scientist must be working together, as complementary disciplines. One elaborates the ideals of a Godly moral order. Legal and social science scholars on law will deploy these yardsticks to discover if laws and legal regulations, market and legal institutions, measure up to those ideals. Such an interdependency of endeavor elevates the work of a social scientist beyond empirical research and theory-building into another realm a Christian scholarly calling.</p>\n<p>Put another way, Biggar points to a two-directional move for the Christian scholar on legal orders. In one direction, s/he compares and contrasts TLO ideals with created order ideals. In the other direction, s/he discovers whether the ideals in practice produce goods and human flourishing. This benefits the social science enterprise itself. Contingent social theory will identify what prevents or facilitates the implementation of the ideals articulated in a Christian moral order. Not least, as Biggar writes elsewhere, strong empirical foundations are necessary for theological ethics to be well grounded.</p>\n<h2>Double Disorder in Legal Change</h2>\n<p>As social scientists we can distinguish between two form of disorder in legal change.</p>\n<p><i>Disjunctive disorder </i>most visibly takes the form of exogenous shocks external to an institution or state. A massive oil spill, an economic crisis, atrocities, a pandemic, can highlight the inadequacies of current orders and precipitate a movement towards a whole new episode of legal change, even the construction of a new legal order in a domain of finance or commerce or human rights or the environment, among others. These shocks may border on chaos in their unpredictability and irrationality.</p>\n<p>By contrast, there is a form of <i>constitutive disorder </i>which is integral to the dynamics of everyday adaptation and almost imperceptible change. Here the inner workings of a legal or social order, their faults and failures, propel responses which more or less, sooner or later, can shift the order in a more effective direction, however \u201ceffective\u201d is defined. Here the outer contexts of an order, the slow changes in economic, social and political circumstances, also propel a legal order to change, to adapt the current order in ways that deliver the goods, moral and material, for which the order was constructed (cf. \u0007\u0003(Mahoney and Thelen 2010)\b.</p>\n<h2>Lingering Questions</h2>\n<p>Biggar compounds the already evident forms of disjunctive and constitutive disorder in legal and social institutions by inducing another kind of disturbance\u2014the critique, counterpoint and inspiration of a Christian moral order that offers a distinctive vision of a good social or legal order. In so doing, the ideals of the created moral order contribute constructively to a dismantling or reconstruction of present orders.</p>\n<p>In the spirit of dialogue, however, can what we know about social and legal orders speak back to understandings of moral orders? I have already raised the challenge of specifying high level doctrinal and theological ethics sufficiently to provide some precision for application to social and legal orders. Other questions remain.</p>\n<p>First, how much disorder is there within created moral orders? Within the scriptures, and across schools of thought in the Christian tradition, we observe differing conceptions of which ideals should be given primacy, both as derivations from scripture and doctrinal principles, and in applications to different places and times in biblical and Christian history. How is the Christian social scientist to discern what kinds of disorder should be induced in current institutions and what principles of order should replace them? Dialogue across the theological/disciplinary divide seems imperative.</p>\n<p>Second, it seems that social orders not infrequently in the history of the church have induced revisions in the application of ideals to social institutions. Consider the democratic revolutions that overturn medieval presumptions about political order. Or, the rise of women\u2019s movements since the 19<sup>th</sup> Century and their implications for the dignity of women, not least their roles in church leadership. Or, the effect of a sexual revolution on some branches of churches\u2019 moral orders on homosexuality. Does disruption of legal and social orders have a dynamic effect on disordering and then reordering understandings of the created moral order, insofar as we see through a glass darkly?</p>\n<p>Third, should our understandings of created order reflect something of the uncertainties, approximations, and limitations evident in the construction and adaptation of legal and social orders? Must some of the contingency, even humility, that requires partial corrections and adjustments in social orders be also acknowledged in the expressions of created order insofar as they are crafted by fallen thinkers, themselves shaped by social and historical contexts with their brokenness and flaws?</p>\n<p>Fourth, do the extent that legal and social orders always display gaps between their designers and outcomes, is there an element of moral contingency that any given set of standards and rules derived from higher-order ideals might be altered if their application in practice proves to be counter-productive, even subversive?</p>\n<h2 class=\"new_page\">References</h2>\n<p>Block-Lieb, Susan, and Terence C.

It may or may not pursue the same end and purpose as God\u2019s moral law. It may adopt or allow debatable means to achieve a good objective. Human order may pursue utilitarians or community good at the expense of individual rights. Moreover, human order may not necessarily be compatible with freedom. In Biggar\u2019s words, it is subject to \u201csinful corruption and distortion.\u201d (p.2) Compared to divine order, \u201chuman order might be found morally wanting.\u201d God\u2019s moral law and human order may have overlapping values but they can also differ significantly.\n\nFrom my experience and observation in the discipline of law, I identify several issues in comparing God\u2019s moral law versus positive law for discussion.\n\nThe first issue is the limits of human legal order to realize God\u2019s moral goods. Legal order is a specific aspect of human order. It includes the rules and norms issued by the legislature on the people, as well as administrative regulations and judicial decisions. Law can govern, confer power and rights, impose duties and obligations, or restrict rights and freedom. Law can also determine how law is made, changed and adjudicated. [\u00a01\u00a0] In democratic societies, law is the result of democratic deliberation, agreement and compromises in the legislature. In authoritarian states, law is primarily the manifestation of the sovereign will, which may or may not incorporate the views of the public.\n\nIn a free and open society, law is generally founded on some universal moral norms. For example, the law of contract is based on the principles of trust, fairness and equality. Criminal law is founded on the principles of just deserts, punishment of wrongs and rehabilitation of wrongdoers. The principle of the rule of law requires law to be clear, predictable, applied equally, non-arbitrary and to protect fundamental rights. [\u00a02\u00a0] However, no matter how well drafted human law is , there may still be gaps, inadequacies, or areas which need to be updated so that the law in line with social change. Even if the moral values of a legal system on which legal rules are built generally reflect God\u2019s moral law, the human legal order will not be a full and complete representation of God\u2019s morality without distortion and flaws. Human law is like a shadow of God\u2019s perfect moral law. Further, the legal system is administered by flawed human beings. And, there are areas of our lives not falling within the spheres governed by human law. Therefore, people who fully obey human law can find themselves failing to meet God\u2019s moral requirements or acting in contravention to God\u2019s moral law.\n\nIn section 10 of the Brief on Theology, Biggar stated that prohibiting all immorality by law would intrude too much into the private lives of citizens and impose too much social control. I agree. Whereas God\u2019s morality is complete and all-encompassing, only some moral values are best achieved by legal order; others are best advanced by alternative human orders, including social, cultural or economic orders, often by a combination of these. Fundamentally the issue is: what order--legal, social, political, economic or cultural--is more suitable to shape human behaviour to achieve the good in a particular circumstance?\n\nUnder traditional British common law culture, law should not interfere into the private lives of citizens. Common law traditions, founded in Britain and extended to most former British colonies, prioritize individualism and liberty. Sir John Laws argued that the common law presumption of liberty includes three propositions: \"For the individual citizen, everything which is not forbidden is allowed; but for public bodies, and notably government, everything which is not allowed is forbidden.\" [\u00a03\u00a0] Second, \u201cevery intrusion by the state upon the freedom of the individual stands in need of objective justification.\u201d The third proposition is the principle of minimal interference. As Sir John Laws puts it, the non-utilitarian, \u201cKantian ethic of justice is a vital building block in the edifice of the common law.\u201d\n\nBiggar pointed out in his Brief that there is a difference between Western and traditional Asian culture on order and freedom. Whereas Western culture leans towards liberty, traditional Asian culture prefers order and the \u201csubjection of the individual to the requirements of the community.\u201d Order leads to stability, from which there is \u201cpeaceful opportunity to plan and build a prosperous material life\u201d. It can be argued that traditional Asian legal cultures derived from Confucian values often prefer a utilitarian viewpoint for the benefit of the community as a whole, instead of prioritizing individual rights and freedom; though nowadays, many Asian countries are not quite so traditional as they once were, as many have embraced modern values in free and democratic societies.\n\nOne example to illustrate traditional Confucian values and the limit of positive law is Mainland China\u2019s elder protection law, [\u00a04\u00a0] which requires adult children to financially support their aging parents and pay regular visits to them. Here the traditional Confucian value of filial piety is written down as positive law. While it is not uncommon for both Asian and Western countries to impose obligations on adult children to provide financial support to their parents, China\u2019s law is special by imposing a legal duty on adult children to care for the emotional needs of aging parents by paying visits to them.\n\nThe rationale behind the law is to protect the rights of elderly parents, to shape and encourage the moral behaviour of loyalty, care and respect by adult children towards their parents, and to alleviate the government financial burden on providing welfare to the elderly. [\u00a05\u00a0]\n\nThis law is controversial as people disagree on whether it is desirable to use law to resolve moral and family issues. While for some adult children, the crystallization of filial piety into law may serve as an encouragement and place positive pressure on them to give more care and emotional support to their aging parents, for others the law may create more tension and may damage family harmony when adult children are forced by law to visit their parents unwillingly. This is particularly so if the parent-adult children relationship had already been tense. There may be a sense of coercion, disingenuity and unpleasantness when God\u2019s commandment of \u201chonour your father and mother\u201d and the traditional Confucian value of filial piety are written as positive law backed by fine and imprisonment. Care and visits to elderly parents should be motivated by love and respect, rather than fear of punishment. Some argue that education and positive promotion are more effective ways to foster the virtue of filial piety.\n\nThere is also the practical difficulty with enforcement of such law. Chinese societies are averse to bringing matters to the court. Traditionally people value harmony, and only treat litigation as the last resort. This is especially so for disputes within the family. There is family shame attached if the matter is made public in open court. The reputation of the family will be damaged by the legal dispute.\n\nFrom a macro societal perspective, caring for the elderly parents raises a number of broader issues including social welfare in a rapidly aging society, China\u2019s previous one child policy, challenges created by migrant workers living in cities in visiting far away elderly parents living in rural areas, and the withering traditional values of filial piety in modern society.\n\nCompared to God\u2019s law, which governs both the heart and behaviour, there is a limit to the capability of positive law to solve a moral problem without going too deeply into underlying relational and social issues. Human law alone may be inapt to achieve God\u2019s morality.\n\nIn the British common law, one famous example of transposition of the Bible teaching to positive law is the Neighbour Principle in the tort of negligence, an area of law that imposes legal liability on persons who carelessly cause harm to another person or damage to his property. The neighbour principle is derived from Jesus\u2019 teaching of \u201clove thy neighbour\u201d and expressed in the famous case of Donoghue v Stevenson [\u00a06\u00a0] in 1932, in which Lord Akin stated that:\n\n\u201cThe principle is that one must take reasonable care to avoid acts or omissions that could reasonably be foreseen as likely to injure one\u2019s neighbour. A neighbour was identified as someone who was so closely and directly affected by the act that one ought to have them in contemplation as being so affected when directing one\u2019s mind to the acts or omissions in question.\u201d\n\nThis principle is the foundation of modern tort law of negligence in the common law world. Basically one is required to \u201cdo no harm\u201d to one\u2019s neighbour by taking reasonable care, and in case of breach, one is liable to pay compensation. The principle governs all types of relationships where a person has a duty of care to the other, including producers and consumers, premise occupiers and visitors, employers and employees, etc. The principle continued to develop and expand after Donoghue v Stevenson and has become the building block of modern tort law of negligence.\n\nWhy is the neighbour principle so grounded whereas the filial piety law is controversial, when both commands are derived from the Bible? First of all, the Neighbour Principle is a \u201cdo no harm\u201d principle, a much attenuated version of Jesus\u2019 commandment of \u201clove your neighbour as yourself\u201d. It operates within the existing legal framework, and the duty is one of respect and protection only, i.e. not to injure a person or make him or her suffer a loss. It is based on monetary compensation for the harm done, which is clearly a lower standard than that of God\u2019s moral law. God\u2019s commandment of \u201clove they neighbour\u201d is founded on grace and compassion, which is not the standard that tort law aims to achieve.\n\nFrom the above two examples, we can see that regardless of legal culture and tradition, there are inevitable gaps between human law and God\u2019s moral law, be it in the purpose of the law, the formulation, the depth, the sphere of governance, the content, the administration, the effects and impacts of the law. The limits of positive law to achieve God\u2019s moral ideals need to be acknowledged by Christians to avoid disappointments and over reliance on positive law to advance Christian moral principles.\n\nThe Lord has already shown us what us good, \u201cto act justly and to love mercy and to walk humbly with your God\u201d (Micah 6:8). In creating and administering human legal order, Christians should walk with God and rely on God for wisdom to do justice. Biggar stated in section 8 that moral judgment requires reasoning, creativity and re-imagination. It is not a mechanical application but a process of critical reflection. It is therefore compatible with freedom. Though human order will invariably fall short of divine moral order, Christians can and should continue to use their creativity and re-imagination to strive towards better attainment of divine morality in human orders of all kinds, not only through formal law.\n\n[\u00a01\u00a0] Hart, H.L.A.

Filial Piety Law</h3>\n<p>One example to illustrate traditional Confucian values and the limit of positive law is Mainland China\u2019s elder protection law,<a class=\"anchor\" id=\"content100note4anc\" name=\"content100note4anc\">\u00a0</a><a class=\"note\" href=\"#content100note4sym\">[\u00a04\u00a0]</a><b> </b>which requires adult children to financially support their aging parents and pay regular visits to them. Here the traditional Confucian value of filial piety is written down as positive law. While it is not uncommon for both Asian and Western countries to impose obligations on adult children to provide financial support to their parents, China\u2019s law is special by imposing a legal duty on adult children to care for the emotional needs of aging parents by paying visits to them.</p>\n<p>The rationale behind the law is to protect the rights of elderly parents, to shape and encourage the moral behaviour of loyalty, care and respect by adult children towards their parents, and to alleviate the government financial burden on providing welfare to the elderly.<a class=\"anchor\" id=\"content100note5anc\" name=\"content100note5anc\">\u00a0</a><a class=\"note\" href=\"#content100note5sym\">[\u00a05\u00a0]</a></p>\n<p>This law is controversial as people disagree on whether it is desirable to use law to resolve moral and family issues. While for some adult children, the crystallization of filial piety into law may serve as an encouragement and place positive pressure on them to give more care and emotional support to their aging parents, for others the law may create more tension and may damage family harmony when adult children are forced by law to visit their parents unwillingly. This is particularly so if the parent-adult children relationship had already been tense. There may be a sense of coercion, disingenuity and unpleasantness when God\u2019s commandment of \u201chonour your father and mother\u201d and the traditional Confucian value of filial piety are written as positive law backed by fine and imprisonment. Care and visits to elderly parents should be motivated by love and respect, rather than fear of punishment. Some argue that education and positive promotion are more effective ways to foster the virtue of filial piety.</p>\n<p>There is also the practical difficulty with enforcement of such law. Chinese societies are averse to bringing matters to the court. Traditionally people value harmony, and only treat litigation as the last resort. This is especially so for disputes within the family. There is family shame attached if the matter is made public in open court. The reputation of the family will be damaged by the legal dispute.</p>\n<p>From a macro societal perspective, caring for the elderly parents raises a number of broader issues including social welfare in a rapidly aging society, China\u2019s previous one child policy, challenges created by migrant workers living in cities in visiting far away elderly parents living in rural areas, and the withering traditional values of filial piety in modern society.</p>\n<p>Compared to God\u2019s law, which governs both the heart and behaviour, there is a limit to the capability of positive law to solve a moral problem without going too deeply into underlying relational and social issues. Human law alone may be inapt to achieve God\u2019s morality.</p>\n<h3>2. The Neighbour Principle in Tort Law</h3>\n<p>In the British common law, one famous example of transposition of the Bible teaching to positive law is the Neighbour Principle in the tort of negligence, an area of law that imposes legal liability on persons who carelessly cause harm to another person or damage to his property. The neighbour principle is derived from Jesus\u2019 teaching of \u201clove thy neighbour\u201d and expressed in the famous case of <i>Donoghue v Stevenson<a class=\"anchor\" id=\"content100note6anc\" name=\"content100note6anc\">\u00a0</a><a class=\"note\" href=\"#content100note6sym\">[\u00a06\u00a0]</a></i> in 1932, in which Lord Akin stated that:</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>\u201cThe principle is that one must take reasonable care to avoid acts or omissions that could reasonably be foreseen as likely to injure one\u2019s neighbour. A neighbour was identified as someone who was so closely and directly affected by the act that one ought to have them in contemplation as being so affected when directing one\u2019s mind to the acts or omissions in question.\u201d</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>\u201cThe principle is that one must take reasonable care to avoid acts or omissions that could reasonably be foreseen as likely to injure one\u2019s neighbour. A neighbour was identified as someone who was so closely and directly affected by the act that one ought to have them in contemplation as being so affected when directing one\u2019s mind to the acts or omissions in question.\u201d</p>\n<p>This principle is the foundation of modern tort law of negligence in the common law world. Basically one is required to \u201cdo no harm\u201d to one\u2019s neighbour by taking reasonable care, and in case of breach, one is liable to pay compensation. The principle governs all types of relationships where a person has a duty of care to the other, including producers and consumers, premise occupiers and visitors, employers and employees, etc. The principle continued to develop and expand after <i>Donoghue v Stevenson</i> and has become the building block of modern tort law of negligence.</p>\n<p>Why is the neighbour principle so grounded whereas the filial piety law is controversial, when both commands are derived from the Bible? First of all, the Neighbour Principle is a \u201cdo no harm\u201d principle, a much attenuated version of Jesus\u2019 commandment of \u201clove your neighbour as yourself\u201d. It operates within the existing legal framework, and the duty is one of respect and protection only, i.e. not to injure a person or make him or her suffer a loss. It is based on monetary compensation for the harm done, which is clearly a lower standard than that of God\u2019s moral law. God\u2019s commandment of \u201clove they neighbour\u201d is founded on grace and compassion, which is not the standard that tort law aims to achieve.</p>\n<p>From the above two examples, we can see that regardless of legal culture and tradition, there are inevitable gaps between human law and God\u2019s moral law, be it in the purpose of the law, the formulation, the depth, the sphere of governance, the content, the administration, the effects and impacts of the law. The limits of positive law to achieve God\u2019s moral ideals need to be acknowledged by Christians to avoid disappointments and over reliance on positive law to advance Christian moral principles.</p>\n<h2>Beyond the Limit</h2>\n<p>The Lord has already shown us what us good, \u201cto act justly and to love mercy and to walk humbly with your God\u201d (Micah 6:8). In creating and administering human legal order, Christians should walk with God and rely on God for wisdom to do justice. Biggar stated in section 8 that moral judgment requires reasoning, creativity and re-imagination. It is not a mechanical application but a process of critical reflection. It is therefore compatible with freedom. Though human order will invariably fall short of divine moral order, Christians can and should continue to use their creativity and re-imagination to strive towards better attainment of divine morality in human orders of all kinds, not only through formal law.</p>\n<h2 class=\"new_page\">Endnotes</h2>\n<p class=\"endnote\"><a class=\"note\" href=\"#content100note1anc\">[\u00a01\u00a0]</a><a class=\"anchor\" id=\"content100note1sym\" name=\"content100note1sym\">\u00a0</a> Hart, H.L.A.

    "bodyText": "In this short essay, I would like to offer some comments on the relation of the created order, and Nigel Biggar\u2019s reflections on the created order (Biggar, 2022), to the discipline of public health. I will structure my comments around three propositions.\n\nPublic health has been defined \u201cthe art and science of preventing disease, prolonging life and promoting health through the organized efforts of society\u201d (Acheson, 1988; WHO). God created the human person good with various capacities including capacities to act, to reason, and to love. These capacities arise from the physical, mental, social, and spiritual nature of the human person. The human person attains his or her fulfillment in the exercise of these capacities in relation to God and to others so as to flourish as the type of creature that the human person is (Biggar, 2022). The human person is embodied and care for the body enables our various human capacities.\n\nHuman capacities \u2013 such as to act, to reason, and to love \u2013 are expanded by our living within communities (Biggar, 2022). We benefit from each other\u2019s knowledge. We benefit from coordinated activity. We benefit from not only loving and being loved by others, but from seeking together a common good. Public health, as the art and science of preventing disease, prolonging life and promoting health through the organized efforts of society, is a product of our living together in a coordinated manner within communities. In working as a community, public health institutions can share knowledge about health, and its distribution and determinants, and can work together to preserve and promote health.\n\nWithin God\u2019s created order, the human body has an extraordinary capacity to heal itself. Health is in some sense the body\u2019s natural state as created by God (Aquinas, 1265, 1.3.157; Gadamar, 1996, Chapter 8; VanderWeele, 2022, 1.3b). The body often effectively heals from minor injuries naturally over time, and the body will sometimes recover from disease by its normal operations; it has a certain capacity for restoration. This capacity of the body to restore itself is part of God\u2019s care and providence \u2013 God\u2019s ordering and sustaining the world. Health in some sense was, and is, God\u2019s intent.\n\nHowever, as a result of human wrongdoing and the fallen nature of our world, the body and the human person no longer retain perfect health, and the body\u2019s capacity for restoration of health is limited. Institutions of public health make us better aware of our deficiencies with respect to health and well-being, and give us knowledge as to how to address those deficiencies and how to limit or prevent declines in health. Because of the fallen nature of humanity and of the world, such attempts will always at best be met with only partial success. All do eventually die and our mortality should be taken into account in thinking about issues of the distribution of resources to promote health. However, by working together, by coordinating knowledge and action, health can better be preserved. This is itself a caring for one another. This caring can itself be a form of love, part of God\u2019s intent for the created order.\n\nCare for the environment and for our world is critical as a part of promoting health and well-being. This is so because our environment affects our physical health. However, care for the environment is also important because the world in which we live has been entrusted to us by God. Care for our world is part of the task that we have been given by God to do (Biggar, 2022). We are to have a certain love for all of creation as all of the created order was originally created good by God (Francis, 2015; Biggar, 2022).\n\nCare for the environment includes care of living things, along with limiting the damage done to our world with respect to making it less hospitable to human life, and to other forms of life (Francis, 2015). Pollution, toxins and harmful chemicals can all detrimentally affect human health and the health of other living creatures. Public health includes the study of how various environments and contexts, various chemicals and toxins, and various changes to our climate do or do not affect human health (Woodward and Macmillan, 2015). Because of the fallen nature of our world, there can be difficult trade-offs with respect to actions concerning providing food and energy for present use versus actions that preserve our environment and resources for future use. Careful study of the created order, of what actions are or are not harmful, and to what degree, and on what time horizon, are needed to be able to make decisions in a prudential and just manner (Francis, 2015).\n\nIt is not only the natural environment that affects human health and well-being but our social environment as well (Berkman et al., 2014). Social relationships, communities, families, friendships, and religious life can all powerfully contribute to health and well-being (Berkman et al., 2014; VanderWeele, 2022). Discrimination, injustices, alienation and loneliness, war and violence, can all harm our health and well-being. Careful study of our social contexts \u2013 a study of the created order as embedded in social life and of the constraints imposed by human wrongdoing \u2013 is thus likewise needed promote health and well-being. This too belongs to the discipline of public health in its study of the created order.\n\nPublic health efforts should ultimately be concerned not only with the health of bodies but also with the health of persons. The World Health Organization defines health \u201ca state of complete physical, mental and social well-being and not merely the absence of disease or infirmity.\u201d (WHO, 1946). One might add to this a spiritual dimension of health (Larson, 1996; Peng-Keller, 2022; VanderWeele, 2022) thereby conceiving of health, of a person, as \u201ca state of complete physical, mental, social, and spiritual well-being.\u201d Understanding the physical, mental, social, and spiritual nature of the human person is in some sense the combined task of all academic disciplines. It is the study of the created order as it pertains to the human person and all that affects human persons. Such study can empower the discipline of public health. As we come to better understand what constitutes and contributes to a person\u2019s physical, mental, social, and spiritual well-being, we will come to a better understanding of how these various dimensions of human well-being can better be promoted. We can once again share knowledge, and coordinate action, to promote the health of human persons and human societies.\n\nPublic health thus needs input from the humanities \u2013 from philosophy, theology, history, and the arts \u2013 to discern the nature of human well-being and the spiritual ends of human society. This would include proper discernment of the natural law, the moral order, and the nature of human virtue (Biggar, 2022). In pluralistic contexts, there will inevitably be some disagreement over understandings of morality, virtue, and the good, but some consensus is nevertheless arguably attainable (Biggar, 2022). I would argue that public health might reasonably promote those aspects of human health and well-being concerning which consensus can be attained (VanderWeele, 2022) and that those ends might reasonably include the promotion of happiness, bodily health, meaning, character, good relationships, and material and financial means (VanderWeele, 2017). However, tradition-specific notions of well-being and spiritual well-being should also be respected, and can arguably be promoted, to some extent at least, even in the context of pluralistic societies (VanderWeele et al, 2021; VanderWeele, 2022).\n\nPublic health also needs input from the social sciences \u2013 from psychology, sociology, anthropology, and economics \u2013 to understand the workings of the human person and of human society and communities. This would include, amongst other things, various efforts to empirically study various aspects of human well-being including, as above, happiness, health, meaning, character, relationships, and material means, along with communal well-being (VanderWeele, 2017, 2019).\n\nPublic health needs input from the natural and applied sciences \u2013 to understand the natural world, its effects on human health, and what can be done to structure human life, action, and technology to promote, rather than hinder, human health.\n\nPublic health requires a full study of the created order to be able to best, and most appropriately, and most holistically, carry out its good work in the preventing disease, prolonging of life, and promoting health and well-being.\n\nAcheson, D.

Yet, unfortunately, in this fallen world, we have all been hurt. Perhaps this is why some of us struggle with love more than with morality and order. Nevertheless, let us always remember that what redeems us is not law but love. Biggar explains how the law cascades down from heaven. How much more do we need the same to be true of God\u2019s love!\n\nFor those of us who are not moral theologians, concrete application is both helpful and necessary. Regarding my mother discipline of international relations, Biggar notes:\n\n\u201cIf one state should take the liberty of breaking the law and jettisoning its constraints, other states will begin to wonder why they should put up with them. And if a sufficient number of powerful states abandon those constraints, the law\u2019s authority will collapse, it will become a dead letter, and international relations will enter a dangerous era of high unpredictability, low trust, and extraordinary susceptibility to armed conflict.\u201d\n\nAt the time of writing, 15 November 2022, the world is at risk of witnessing precisely such a dangerous era of high unpredictability. The world is reeling from multiple man-made and natural calamities. Trust is low and there is extraordinary susceptibility to armed conflict. The current war in Ukraine is the most obvious case in point. It started with a Russian attack, in breach of international law and contrary to promises given. The casus belli , it seems, was Ukraine\u2019s entitlement to join a military alliance perceived as hostile by Russia. Was that, and is that, worth a military conflict that is killing countless people and has dire consequences for world energy and food systems? How certain can we be of the moral superiority of \u201cour\u201d side? Has everything been done to avoid the war, and is everything being done, to end it?\n\nEspecially since the end of the East-West conflict, Russia has been involved in fewer military interventions than the USA and other Western countries. Where Russia has invaded a country or region, as in the cases of Crimea and South Ossetia, it was related to the fear of a neighbouring country turning hostile against Russia. While Russia is less powerful than the USA, it is fair to ask if Washington would be any more tolerant of a hostile military alliance extending to its regional neighbourhood in the Western hemisphere. While this is somewhat speculative, we do know that Moscow has hardly been involved in out-of-area interventions in distant parts of the world, at least when compared to Western military interventions.\n\nRegardless, since the outbreak of the Ukraine war in the spring of 2022, propaganda from both sides has become so intense that it is becoming difficult to gain an even-handed understanding of the situation on the ground. There has been open debate on either side about the possibility of using nuclear weapons. The Cold War ended with a consensus that nothing is worth the risk of nuclear war. Indeed, this was one of the reasons why the East-West conflict remained, largely, \u201ccold.\u201d There was direct communication with Moscow even under Brezhnev. Today, a dialogue with Putin would be seen by some as treason. How can fundamental lessons of diplomacy and nuclear deterrence be unlearned so quickly?\n\nFrom a Christian perspective, there can be no doubt that all have sinned and fall short of the glory of God (Romans 3:23). This also means that, in our intellectual quest for the truth, we must go beyond what furthers any particular agenda, including our own. Regarding the war in Ukraine, for instance, we must strive for an even-handed view even in the face of those who would not accept that any fault might lie on \u201cour\u201d side of the trenches. Obviously, this is not to exonerate Russia or any other party from wrongful or criminal conduct.\n\nIn a war situation, even-handed views are unpopular, as even academics tend to look at things in black and white. Therefore, courage is required. When we fail to roundly condemn one side while exonerating the other, partisan observers will attack us. Their attacks will be one-sided, but this does not disqualify their arguments. We must consider their accusations with humility . In a conversation, a colleague accused me of spreading \u201cKremlin propaganda\u201d when I suggested that the West should be more sensitive to the concerns expressed by Russia as a humiliated great power. Spreading Kremlin propaganda is not a minor accusation, and I did not feel I deserved it. I found that, in a situation like this, keeping one\u2019s patience can be challenging. I took a deep breath and tried to explain to my colleague, as humbly and calmly as I could, that my aim was not to side with Russia but to point to something that might have enabled, and might still enable, diplomatic negotiations and peaceful change rather than replicating a conflict that is so hugely damaging.\n\nIn my perception, the colleague had accused me unjustly and so I found it difficult to render justice to what he was saying. While spreading Kremlin propaganda was clearly not my aim, it surely had to be of concern to me that part of what I had said was overlapping with what a Kremlin speaker might say. It was uncomfortable to accept that, perhaps, my colleague had put his finger on a vulnerable spot and I should take greater care to distance myself. When discussing previous military interventions, my colleague also pointed me to a factual inaccuracy regarding an historical detail. In all honesty, I found it difficult to accept any form of criticism from someone who had just accused me of spreading Kremlin propaganda. Yet, the intellectual virtue of docility demanded me to concede the inaccuracy of my historical claim and stand corrected. I had to remember that, ultimately, what unites us is a search for truth , and that the truth can only reveal itself in a discursive spirit of give-and-take.\n\nThe last two paragraphs cover, in the following order, six of the intellectual virtues listed by Biggar: (1) humility; (2) courage; (3) patience; (4) justice; (5) docility; and (6) search for truth. Professing these virtues is easy in principle, but hard in the heat of a real intellectual encounter. In the exchange with my colleague, I passed the test by the skin of my teeth, but I must confess that many other times I fall short. One reason for this is that, ever since the cardinal virtues of yore, all good things come in sevens. The seventh intellectual virtue is, arguably, only one step away from Christian love. Biggar calls it charity . If only we could become a community of brothers and sisters carrying out disagreements in love, alerting one another of the specks of sawdust in our eyes lest they solidify into planks.\n\nFriedrichs, J\u00f6rg (2016) An Intercultural Theory of International Relations: How Self-Worth Underlies Politics Among Nations, International Theory 8 (1): 63-93.\n\nFriedrichs, J\u00f6rg (2016) Thinking on Time: How Scholarly Praxis can Sustain, Subvert and Transform Social Reality, in Gunther Hellmann and Jens Steffek (eds) Praxis as a Perspective on International Politics , Bristol: Bristol University Press, pp. 197-211.\n\nWolf, Reinhard (2022) Between Deference and Defiance: Hierarchical Status Roles and International Conflict, International Studies Review 66 (1): 1-13",

    "bodyText": "I specialize in legal orders such as the laws and institutions that govern taxation or human rights or finance or crime or the climate or the environment\u2014indeed, almost any sphere of human life and behavior. In this essay, I explore implications of Nigel\u2019s Biggar\u2019s evocative account of moral and social orders for scholars who study legal change, and in my case, the dynamics of transnational legal orders (TLOs). Almost every aspect of 21 st century social orders are shaped by law, and domestic legal orders are almost always embedded to some degree or other in transnational orders that span national frontiers and weave together persons, institutions and states across regions and the world. These orders are constantly undergoing change, as they rise or fall, remain adaptive and vibrant, or become fragile and marginal.\n\nI make two arguments in this Brief. First, a certain kind of disorder is integral to the viability of legal orders, and by extension, other social orders. Second, that the created moral order, as depicted by Biggar, will have a disturbing effect on current legal orders, effectively shaking them up in ways that induce social disorder insofar as they are impelled to conform to a higher good. I will illustrate the interplay of chaos, disorder and order in one of my research domains\u2014the laws that govern business failures. I conclude with observations on empirical research as a companion to ethical reflections and with puzzles that remain for me if I seek to bring my social science research into meaningful conformity with Biggar\u2019s theological ethics. In so doing I seek to extrapolate from Biggar\u2019s characterization of the created moral order as \u201cnot a silent, barren thing, but [it] contains\u2014both limiting and including\u2014plurality, vitality, and freedom. God\u2019s order is not dead; it is dynamic.\u201d\n\nIn research on legal change, we observe order and disorder in a dynamic tension. Studies of transnational legal orders point to facilitating circumstances and precipitating events that press individuals, or industries, or states, or international organizations to create or reform an order. Sometimes change comes from outside an order: contexts change; alternative orders present competitive challenges; economic or social or political shocks trigger responses. Sometimes changes come from within an order: its internal organization may become rigid or brittle or irrelevant, or it no longer solves the problems for which it was initially designed. In the worlds of transnational legal orders, globalization and its discontents, the outbreaks of pandemics, the collapse of supply chains, the horrors of starvation and civil war, are among but a few of the disorders and disturbances that we observe when sets of facilitating circumstances suddenly explode and trigger calls for new or reformed orders. The Russian invasion of Ukraine, and China\u2019s erosion of the post WWII international legal order, are prime cases in point.\n\nWe can go a step further and argue that a vibrant social or legal order requires constant disturbance as a dynamic of adaptation. [\u00a01\u00a0] Some degree of disorder becomes an essential condition, perhaps a force, for legal change. It might be styled as a moving equilibrium. Sometimes it may be purposefully induced by reformers, rights activists, campaigners, and on the international stage, by states or international governmental or civil society organizations, who identify a besetting problem and raise their voices in calls for change, very often, almost always, through some kind of law. Sometimes it is precipitated by the cruelty or narcissism or hubris of rulers who seek to domesticate or dismantle orders that limit their arbitrary power\u2014consider Xi Jinping of China, or Viktor Orban of Hungary\u2014or demand redress for harms committed against their own or adjacent populations.\n\nIn market economies, many businesses fail. When they can no longer pay their bills, business enterprises can leave a trail of woes\u2014unpaid workers, tax payments in arrears, pension funds hollowed out, suppliers out of pocket for goods they delivered, bankers who lent money that is not repaid, investors with moneys depreciated or lost. Assets of equipment or land or buildings or goodwill are not worth enough to pay off creditors in full or make investors whole.\n\nUntil the later twentieth century, business failure met with two responses. [\u00a02\u00a0] One was simply to leave the mess of the economic collapse to the informal processes of a market. The result was too often akin to chaos, an economic war of all against all, where the creditors, those owed money, scrambled to be the first to grab assets and the powerful and elbowed out the weak. Another was to regularize, make orderly through law, the liquidation of a firm. A failing firm could be sold and taken over by a successful firm. Or, a business could be broken up, all its assets sold, and the moneys from the sales used to pay off, usually at a steep discount, those other businesses or the state or workers that were owed money. The orderly approach is the realm of corporate bankruptcy or insolvency law and institutions.\n\nBy the late 1960s and early 1970s a rising level of dissatisfaction in the U.S., and then the United Kingdom, pointed to the economic inefficiencies and unfairness of liquidation as a governing principle, and liquidation law and practice in everyday life. In 1976 the US Congress enacted a Corporate Bankruptcy Code, followed a decade later, by the English Insolvency Act, 1986 (Carruthers and Halliday 1998). While both pieces of legislation diverged in certain respects, both also represented a fundamental shift in legal change. The new laws advocated an ideal of rehabilitation and reorganization. Business managers or professionals could invoke the new laws to give the firm some breathing space, to hold creditors at bay, to restructure finances with a new business plan, to obtain new financing, to reorganize the firm. All these steps, it was thought, would save jobs, preserve more value for creditors, and rescue businesses. Properly restructured, a firm could re-enter the market better equipped to compete within it.\n\nThe influential shifts from a liquidation to reorganization philosophy of business failure in the US and England pointed to an alternative order, but it took massive disorder to precipitate widespread legal change. The 1990s debt crises in Russia and Mexico, and then the Asian Financial Crisis, fundamentally challenged the completeness and efficacy of the prevailing corporate bankruptcy systems in most countries, shocks that revealed and magnified the disorderliness of dealing with companies in distress. In 1987 and 1988 several of the \u201cAsian Tiger\u201d economies collapsed. The International Monetary Fund and World Bank, together with the US and other major economies, coupled a massive infusion of funds to stabilize financial collapse in South Korea and Indonesia, among others, with drastic and often draconian \u201cconditionalities\u201d for change in their financial institutions. To forestall future financial crises, the World Bank and IMF pressed countries to construct robust corporate bankruptcy systems in which reorganization or rehabilitation was a governing principle.\n\nFrom the late 1980s, the G-22 and at least four international organizations\u2014the IMF, World Bank, OECD and the UN--worked with major professional associations of lawyers, accountants, and insolvency practitioners, to formulate a new legal order. Ultimately, the UN Commission on International Trade Law (UNCITRAL) took the lead as a quasi, non-binding global legislature, first creating a Legislative Guide for Insolvency, and following it up with a series of other model and soft laws (Block-Lieb and Halliday 2017). The World Bank and IMF added pressure for countries to reform their laws, often in the course of Article IV reviews and as a condition of lending. Over the past twenty years these laws have been adopted in part or whole by scores of countries, and has influenced legal harmonization efforts in the European Union. In effect, the magnitude of disorder displayed by the Asian Tigers, and later the 2008 Global Financial Crisis, triggered legal change on a global scale. These propelled creation of a global legal order that has gradually taken hold in the early 21 st century.\n\nAlready, within political rhetoric (cf. Mrs. Thatcher\u2019s campaign in the UK to \u201cclean up markets\u201d), and amongst scholars, a notion of the morality of markets emerged since the 1990s on the law and institutions of corporate bankruptcy regimes (Carruthers and Halliday 1996) and thereafter more widely in economic sociology. But this concern with morality had no seeming connection with the created moral order as Biggar portrays it.\n\nIf a morality of markets can be observed within the social science enterprise itself, Biggar would subsume this morality, and all the social behaviors it orders, into a transcendent moral hierarchy that situates created order at its apex. This is a recipe for social disorder. In effect, when the created order comes into contact with a legal or social order, the friction of the two, perhaps always, will produce disorder in extant legal orders. If a current legal order is held accountable to the norms of the created order, it will be subject to \u201cprophetic criticism.\u201d The assumptions, veneers and practices of a given legal order will be exposed, revealing its moral inadequacies and ethical shortcomings. The sociolegal scholar attuned to the ideals of God\u2019s moral order will point to mismatches between those ideals and the law on the books and law in action. That scholar will consistently ask: does the law produce the practices consistent with the created order? This stance of accountability therefore introduces moral disturbance to legal orders and thus acts as a motor of legal change. But what standards does Biggar propose?\n\nFor Biggar, a benevolent created order produces a range of \u201cgoods,\u201d material and immaterial, that produces human flourishing. In Biggar\u2019s terms, any legal order, including corporate insolvency systems, will be measured against ultimate ethical values, including justice, moral integrity, and charity. He also identifies what we might call processual values. To remain responsive to material needs and immaterial values a legal order will display \u201cplurality, vitality and freedom.\u201d\n\nSome of the processual values can be observed in corporate insolvency systems when laws, regulations and institutions stimulate the economic creativity of market players\u2014inventors, business startups, suppliers, investors. Indeed, disturbance of an extant sclerotic bankruptcy system can be produced precisely to compel current actors to break out of their conventional ways of doing business and to open up new spaces for innovation. Assets that are declining in value can be brought into a new financial reorganization with new moneys and new management to renew a firm\u2019s viability. Lawmakers and market actors, therefore, in Biggar\u2019s vision, are called to stewardship of human and financial resources as they work alongside each other to construct ethical and effective market institutions through law.\n\nClearly, the example of corporate bankruptcy orders is a microcosm of a larger challenge. For any social order the Christian social scientist will require the aid and partnership of a theologian and ethicist to bring the biblical and theological, doctrine and abstract ideals, that are sharply pointed enough to disturb current legal and social orders and propel them to deliver the goods and ends of flourishing which the created moral order impels.\n\nIf master ethical criteria for a good legal order are the production of human flourishing and adherence to higher order theological ideals of justice, charity and freedom, then the question immediately arises\u2014how do we know what kinds of laws produce these goods? It is a verity of sociolegal research that good intentions don\u2019t always produce good laws, and good laws don\u2019t always result in good outcomes. A gap invariability opens up between laws-on-the-books and law-in-action.\n\nBiggar implicitly issues a vocational calling, even a research agenda, for the Christian sociologist and empirical legal scholar. In my scholarship on transnational legal orders, I am therefore called to ask\u2014what empirical evidence is that a given legal concept or law or regulation will deliver goods that produce flourishing? [\u00a03\u00a0] What kind of lawmakers and lawmaking processes will ensure that evidence, not ignorance, will drive policy and lawmaking (Halliday 2018)? It appears to me that the ethicist and social scientist must be working together, as complementary disciplines. One elaborates the ideals of a Godly moral order. Legal and social science scholars on law will deploy these yardsticks to discover if laws and legal regulations, market and legal institutions, measure up to those ideals. Such an interdependency of endeavor elevates the work of a social scientist beyond empirical research and theory-building into another realm a Christian scholarly calling.\n\nPut another way, Biggar points to a two-directional move for the Christian scholar on legal orders. In one direction, s/he compares and contrasts TLO ideals with created order ideals. In the other direction, s/he discovers whether the ideals in practice produce goods and human flourishing. This benefits the social science enterprise itself. Contingent social theory will identify what prevents or facilitates the implementation of the ideals articulated in a Christian moral order. Not least, as Biggar writes elsewhere, strong empirical foundations are necessary for theological ethics to be well grounded.\n\nAs social scientists we can distinguish between two form of disorder in legal change.\n\nDisjunctive disorder most visibly takes the form of exogenous shocks external to an institution or state. A massive oil spill, an economic crisis, atrocities, a pandemic, can highlight the inadequacies of current orders and precipitate a movement towards a whole new episode of legal change, even the construction of a new legal order in a domain of finance or commerce or human rights or the environment, among others. These shocks may border on chaos in their unpredictability and irrationality.\n\nBy contrast, there is a form of constitutive disorder which is integral to the dynamics of everyday adaptation and almost imperceptible change. Here the inner workings of a legal or social order, their faults and failures, propel responses which more or less, sooner or later, can shift the order in a more effective direction, however \u201ceffective\u201d is defined. Here the outer contexts of an order, the slow changes in economic, social and political circumstances, also propel a legal order to change, to adapt the current order in ways that deliver the goods, moral and material, for which the order was constructed (cf. \u0007\u0003(Mahoney and Thelen 2010)\b.\n\nBiggar compounds the already evident forms of disjunctive and constitutive disorder in legal and social institutions by inducing another kind of disturbance\u2014the critique, counterpoint and inspiration of a Christian moral order that offers a distinctive vision of a good social or legal order. In so doing, the ideals of the created moral order contribute constructively to a dismantling or reconstruction of present orders.\n\nIn the spirit of dialogue, however, can what we know about social and legal orders speak back to understandings of moral orders? I have already raised the challenge of specifying high level doctrinal and theological ethics sufficiently to provide some precision for application to social and legal orders. Other questions remain.\n\nFirst, how much disorder is there within created moral orders? Within the scriptures, and across schools of thought in the Christian tradition, we observe differing conceptions of which ideals should be given primacy, both as derivations from scripture and doctrinal principles, and in applications to different places and times in biblical and Christian history. How is the Christian social scientist to discern what kinds of disorder should be induced in current institutions and what principles of order should replace them? Dialogue across the theological/disciplinary divide seems imperative.\n\nSecond, it seems that social orders not infrequently in the history of the church have induced revisions in the application of ideals to social institutions. Consider the democratic revolutions that overturn medieval presumptions about political order. Or, the rise of women\u2019s movements since the 19 th Century and their implications for the dignity of women, not least their roles in church leadership. Or, the effect of a sexual revolution on some branches of churches\u2019 moral orders on homosexuality. Does disruption of legal and social orders have a dynamic effect on disordering and then reordering understandings of the created moral order, insofar as we see through a glass darkly?\n\nThird, should our understandings of created order reflect something of the uncertainties, approximations, and limitations evident in the construction and adaptation of legal and social orders? Must some of the contingency, even humility, that requires partial corrections and adjustments in social orders be also acknowledged in the expressions of created order insofar as they are crafted by fallen thinkers, themselves shaped by social and historical contexts with their brokenness and flaws?\n\nFourth, do the extent that legal and social orders always display gaps between their designers and outcomes, is there an element of moral contingency that any given set of standards and rules derived from higher-order ideals might be altered if their application in practice proves to be counter-productive, even subversive?\n\nBlock-Lieb, Susan, and Terence C.

    "bodyHtml": "<p>I specialize in legal orders such as the laws and institutions that govern taxation or human rights or finance or crime or the climate or the environment\u2014indeed, almost any sphere of human life and behavior. In this essay, I explore implications of Nigel\u2019s Biggar\u2019s evocative account of moral and social orders for scholars who study legal change, and in my case, the dynamics of transnational legal orders (TLOs). Almost every aspect of 21<sup>st</sup> century social orders are shaped by law, and domestic legal orders are almost always embedded to some degree or other in transnational orders that span national frontiers and weave together persons, institutions and states across regions and the world. These orders are constantly undergoing change, as they rise or fall, remain adaptive and vibrant, or become fragile and marginal.</p>\n<p>I make two arguments in this Brief. First, a certain kind of disorder is integral to the viability of legal orders, and by extension, other social orders. Second, that the created moral order, as depicted by Biggar, will have a disturbing effect on current legal orders, effectively shaking them up in ways that induce social disorder insofar as they are impelled to conform to a higher good. I will illustrate the interplay of chaos, disorder and order in one of my research domains\u2014the laws that govern business failures. I conclude with observations on empirical research as a companion to ethical reflections and with puzzles that remain for me if I seek to bring my social science research into meaningful conformity with Biggar\u2019s theological ethics. In so doing I seek to extrapolate from Biggar\u2019s characterization of the created moral order as \u201cnot a silent, barren thing, but [it] contains\u2014both limiting and including\u2014plurality, vitality, and freedom. God\u2019s order is not dead; it is dynamic.\u201d</p>\n<h2>The Dynamism of Disorder</h2>\n<p>In research on legal change, we observe order and disorder in a dynamic tension. Studies of transnational legal orders point to facilitating circumstances and precipitating events that press individuals, or industries, or states, or international organizations to create or reform an order. Sometimes change comes from outside an order: contexts change; alternative orders present competitive challenges; economic or social or political shocks trigger responses. Sometimes changes come from within an order: its internal organization may become rigid or brittle or irrelevant, or it no longer solves the problems for which it was initially designed. In the worlds of transnational legal orders, globalization and its discontents, the outbreaks of pandemics, the collapse of supply chains, the horrors of starvation and civil war, are among but a few of the disorders and disturbances that we observe when sets of facilitating circumstances suddenly explode and trigger calls for new or reformed orders. The Russian invasion of Ukraine, and China\u2019s erosion of the post WWII international legal order, are prime cases in point.</p>\n<p>We can go a step further and argue that <i>a vibrant social or legal order requires constant disturbance as a dynamic of adaptation.<a class=\"anchor\" id=\"content100note1anc\" name=\"content100note1anc\">\u00a0</a><a class=\"note\" href=\"#content100note1sym\">[\u00a01\u00a0]</a></i> Some degree of disorder becomes an essential condition, perhaps a force, for legal change.<i> </i>It might be styled as a moving equilibrium. Sometimes it may be purposefully induced by reformers, rights activists, campaigners, and on the international stage, by states or international governmental or civil society organizations, who identify a besetting problem and raise their voices in calls for change, very often, almost always, through some kind of law. Sometimes it is precipitated by the cruelty or narcissism or hubris of rulers who seek to domesticate or dismantle orders that limit their arbitrary power\u2014consider Xi Jinping of China, or Viktor Orban of Hungary\u2014or demand redress for harms committed against their own or adjacent populations.</p>\n<h2>Business Failures and International Economic Law</h2>\n<p>In market economies, many businesses fail. When they can no longer pay their bills, business enterprises can leave a trail of woes\u2014unpaid workers, tax payments in arrears, pension funds hollowed out, suppliers out of pocket for goods they delivered, bankers who lent money that is not repaid, investors with moneys depreciated or lost. Assets of equipment or land or buildings or goodwill are not worth enough to pay off creditors in full or make investors whole.</p>\n<h3>From Liquidation to Rehabilitation</h3>\n<p>Until the later twentieth century, business failure met with two responses.<a class=\"anchor\" id=\"content100note2anc\" name=\"content100note2anc\">\u00a0</a><a class=\"note\" href=\"#content100note2sym\">[\u00a02\u00a0]</a> One was simply to leave the mess of the economic collapse to the informal processes of a market. The result was too often akin to chaos, an economic war of all against all, where the creditors, those owed money, scrambled to be the first to grab assets and the powerful and elbowed out the weak. Another was to regularize, make orderly through law, the liquidation of a firm. A failing firm could be sold and taken over by a successful firm. Or, a business could be broken up, all its assets sold, and the moneys from the sales used to pay off, usually at a steep discount, those other businesses or the state or workers that were owed money. The orderly approach is the realm of corporate bankruptcy or insolvency law and institutions.</p>\n<p>By the late 1960s and early 1970s a rising level of dissatisfaction in the U.S., and then the United Kingdom, pointed to the economic inefficiencies and unfairness of liquidation as a governing principle, and liquidation law and practice in everyday life. In 1976 the US Congress enacted a Corporate Bankruptcy Code, followed a decade later, by the English Insolvency Act, 1986 (Carruthers and Halliday 1998). While both pieces of legislation diverged in certain respects, both also represented a fundamental shift in legal change. The new laws advocated an ideal of rehabilitation and reorganization. Business managers or professionals could invoke the new laws to give the firm some breathing space, to hold creditors at bay, to restructure finances with a new business plan, to obtain new financing, to reorganize the firm. All these steps, it was thought, would save jobs, preserve more value for creditors, and rescue businesses. Properly restructured, a firm could re-enter the market better equipped to compete within it.</p>\n<h3><b>From Disorder to Order in International La</b><b>w</b></h3>\n<p>The influential shifts from a liquidation to reorganization philosophy of business failure in the US and England pointed to an alternative order, but it took massive disorder to precipitate widespread legal change. The 1990s debt crises in Russia and Mexico, and then the Asian Financial Crisis, fundamentally challenged the completeness and efficacy of the prevailing corporate bankruptcy systems in most countries, shocks that revealed and magnified the disorderliness of dealing with companies in distress. In 1987 and 1988 several of the \u201cAsian Tiger\u201d economies collapsed. The International Monetary Fund and World Bank, together with the US and other major economies, coupled a massive infusion of funds to stabilize financial collapse in South Korea and Indonesia, among others, with drastic and often draconian \u201cconditionalities\u201d for change in their financial institutions. To forestall future financial crises, the World Bank and IMF pressed countries to construct robust corporate bankruptcy systems in which reorganization or rehabilitation was a governing principle.</p>\n<p>From the late 1980s, the G-22 and at least four international organizations\u2014the IMF, World Bank, OECD and the UN--worked with major professional associations of lawyers, accountants, and insolvency practitioners, to formulate a new legal order. Ultimately, the UN Commission on International Trade Law (UNCITRAL) took the lead as a quasi, non-binding global legislature, first creating a Legislative Guide for Insolvency, and following it up with a series of other model and soft laws (Block-Lieb and Halliday 2017). The World Bank and IMF added pressure for countries to reform their laws, often in the course of Article IV reviews and as a condition of lending. Over the past twenty years these laws have been adopted in part or whole by scores of countries, and has influenced legal harmonization efforts in the European Union. In effect, the magnitude of disorder displayed by the Asian Tigers, and later the 2008 Global Financial Crisis, triggered legal change on a global scale. These propelled creation of a global legal order that has gradually taken hold in the early 21<sup>st</sup> century.</p>\n<h2>Created Moral Order and Legal Change</h2>\n<p>Already, within political rhetoric (cf. Mrs. Thatcher\u2019s campaign in the UK to \u201cclean up markets\u201d), and amongst scholars, a notion of the morality of markets emerged since the 1990s on the law and institutions of corporate bankruptcy regimes (Carruthers and Halliday 1996) and thereafter more widely in economic sociology. But this concern with morality had no seeming connection with the created moral order as Biggar portrays it.</p>\n<h3>Creative Moral Order Disturbances for Legal Change</h3>\n<p>If a morality of markets can be observed within the social science enterprise itself, Biggar would subsume this morality, and all the social behaviors it orders, into a transcendent moral hierarchy that situates created order at its apex. This is a recipe for social disorder. In effect, when the created order comes into contact with a legal or social order, the friction of the two, perhaps always, will produce disorder in extant legal orders. If a current legal order is held accountable to the norms of the created order, it will be subject to \u201cprophetic criticism.\u201d The assumptions, veneers and practices of a given legal order will be exposed, revealing its moral inadequacies and ethical shortcomings. The sociolegal scholar attuned to the ideals of God\u2019s moral order will point to mismatches between those ideals and the law on the books and law in action. That scholar will consistently ask: does the law produce the practices consistent with the created order? This stance of accountability therefore introduces moral disturbance to legal orders and thus acts as a motor of legal change. But what standards does Biggar propose?</p>\n<h3>Towards Goods and Flourishing</h3>\n<p>For Biggar, a benevolent created order produces a range of \u201cgoods,\u201d material and immaterial, that produces human flourishing. In Biggar\u2019s terms, any legal order, including corporate insolvency systems, will be measured against <i>ultimate</i> ethical values, including justice, moral integrity, and charity. He also identifies what we might call <i>processual </i>values. To remain responsive to material needs and immaterial values a legal order will display \u201cplurality, vitality and freedom.\u201d</p>\n<p>Some of the processual values can be observed in corporate insolvency systems when laws, regulations and institutions stimulate the economic creativity of market players\u2014inventors, business startups, suppliers, investors. Indeed, disturbance of an extant sclerotic bankruptcy system can be produced precisely to compel current actors to break out of their conventional ways of doing business and to open up new spaces for innovation. Assets that are declining in value can be brought into a new financial reorganization with new moneys and new management to renew a firm\u2019s viability. Lawmakers and market actors, therefore, in Biggar\u2019s vision, are called to stewardship of human and financial resources as they work alongside each other to construct ethical and effective market institutions through law.</p>\n<p>While it is fairly straightforward to identify material benefits of an economic legal order, the immaterial and ultimate values present more of a challenge. One approach might be to hold the ethics of players in failing businesses and bankruptcy systems to the virtues that Biggar identifies, such as humility, critical self-reflection, and openness to correction. Others, such as prudence and charity can also come into play. However, the ultimate values of the created order identified by Biggar, such as justice, require explicit reasoning that derives and specifies the abstract value into applications for specific rules and laws, regulations and institutions. While clearly beyond Biggar\u2019s remit in this Theology Brief, a <i>Christian </i>theological ethics of corporate bankruptcy orders will need to weigh such values as forgiveness with fairness, economic power with economic vulnerability, reward for effort with reward for innovation.</p>\n<p>Clearly, the example of corporate bankruptcy orders is a microcosm of a larger challenge. For any social order the Christian social scientist will require the aid and partnership of a theologian and ethicist to bring the biblical and theological, doctrine and abstract ideals, that are sharply pointed enough to disturb current legal and social orders and propel them to deliver the goods and ends of flourishing which the created moral order impels.</p>\n<h2>Empirics</h2>\n<p>If master ethical criteria for a good legal order are the production of human flourishing and adherence to higher order theological ideals of justice, charity and freedom, then the question immediately arises\u2014how do we know what kinds of laws produce these goods? It is a verity of sociolegal research that good intentions don\u2019t always produce good laws, and good laws don\u2019t always result in good outcomes.

The existence of order in the economy, without any single organising institution or blueprint, is in many ways profoundly surprising and reassuring, given the significance of economic activities for human flourishing, but there is no presumption either that the order is always stable and well-functioning, or that the outcomes are always just. As put by Nigel Biggar:\n\n\u201cThe Creator and his creatures\u2014 a fortiori , his sinful creatures\u2014are not identical and should not be confused. The divinely created order is one thing; human orders are another. The two are not the same and the latter cannot automatically claim the authority of the former. Judged in the light of divine order, any human order might be found morally wanting.\u201d\n\nThe notion of order relevant to markets is that they organize a non-chaotic provision of goods and services, and, that this is accomplished by prices providing incentives \u2013 giving \u2018orders\u2019 \u2013 to a range of actors such as consumers and producers. As befits modern liberal democracy (though markets are used extensively elsewhere) the orders come in the form of offers, which introduce a degree of freedom in the response of the agent to the order and their \u2018orders.\u2019\n\nThe market economy has two essential features that enable it to function in this manner. The first is private property. Negatively that involves protection by social mores or law that prevents others taking another\u2019s property by force; positively it involves freedom of action (\u2018laissez faire\u2019) in the use and disposition of property, without undue interference from government or other authorities. The second essential feature is the mediation of exchange through markets in which prices play a key role. Reducing undue interference by government is especially valued here, in Free Market Liberalism.\n\nMarkets require the existence of a medium of exchange \u2013 money. Without it, all economic exchanges would have to be effected by barter over goods and services, which would be immensely cumbersome. [\u00a01\u00a0] Prices play a key role in markets, not just by facilitating exchange, but also for their information and incentive characteristics. By observing prices for goods and services in markets, the owners of a resource can identify where the returns are most advantageous, and apply the resource accordingly. This is the incentive property of prices. But note too that prices are essentially providing information to the owner, without her having to know all the suppliers or the needs of all those demanding the resource. The same advantages of the market price system are present for the person who is seeking to purchase goods or services.\n\nWithout these freely adjusting prices, it would be up to some kind of social planner to resolve the inevitable mismatches between the goods and services produced and those desired in a large complex economy. Market prices fall when there are too many items on offer, removing incentives to produce and providing bargains for consumers to help eliminate the glut. Similarly, market prices rise during a shortage, eliminating it by encouraging production and curbing consumption.\n\nIt is doubtful that markets can function without the support of some wider framework of law or social custom. However, their ubiquity across many times and cultures suggests that the legal and customary requirements may not be stringent. The contracts that form the core of market systems need to be enforceable in some way, and suppliers need to tell the truth about their products. This suggests the need for some moral underpinning external to the market system to ensure that it functions effectively with market participants adhering to standards of honesty, truth telling, and fulfilment of obligations. [\u00a02\u00a0]\n\nA feature of the market system identified by some proponents is that it is neutral with respect to what is being transacted. In this view it is just a mechanism for meeting the wishes of consumers, and does not concern itself with the actual goods and services. It is flexible with respect to cultural values and trends, but also permits minority interests to be served without asking moral questions. For example, a consumer who has ethical concerns about the sourcing of goods (\u2018under what working conditions was this piece of clothing produced?\u2019, \u2018has this coffee or tea been \u201cfairly traded\u201d?\u2019) can choose ethically, while another consumer who does not have those concerns can also find suppliers, possibly more cheaply. The point is that the range of goods and services transacted simply reflects the choices of the consumers. A Christian critique of the market will note this feature, and value the freedom afforded to individuals, but see that its moral worth depends on whether the items traded contribute to human flourishing, as Biggar emphatically states. Markets also exist for intrinsically evil things, like modern-day slaves.\n\nThe \u2018external\u2019 role of morality was emphasised by Griffiths (1982, 1984) who distinguished a market economy based on the values of \u2018Mammon\u2019, with one based on the values of faith (and notably the values of the Protestant Reformers). He suggested that the latter would both resolve the concerns about truth telling and integrity in market transactions, and would also counter some of the effects of \u2018materialism\u2019 in consumption . But how this change in values is to be brought about is unclear.\n\nThe widespread existence of market systems historically and geographically raises the question of how these systems arise, given that they have not been mandated by some organising authority. The liberal tradition identifies two prerequisites for markets to evolve: individual freedom and individual property rights. Individuals with property rights enter into exchanges involving the goods, resources, and capacities with which they are endowed, because they perceive economic benefits accruing to themselves from those exchanges. Hayek uses the word \u2018catallaxy\u2019 to describe the spontaneous market order that emerges and compares it to the order found in language. He prefers this term to \u2018economy\u2019 because the latter implies some overarching purpose, which determines the ends to which resources are allocated; for Hayek (1973) the abiding feature of the market economy is that there are no such ends. Individuals may have their own purposes and objectives in their trading activities, but these are reconciled within the framework of the market. Each individual seeks his or her own ends within the opportunities that the market offers.\n\nWhether the market and its outcomes are compatible with a Christian understanding of flourishing is hard to generalize. As Biggar observes, the biblical account identifies the purpose of the created order and the economic role of humankind as seeking the flourishing of humanity as a whole. The doctrine of the fall fits awkwardly with the assumption of guaranteed social harmony of the market described by Hayek. The Christian concept of economic justice requires more than just contracting in markets: it focuses attention on both the processes and outcomes of market interactions. Processes are important because a crude consequentialist ethic, so common in the pragmatic expressions of economics, emphasizes ends far more than means. In an example to be taken up presently, a market for adoptive babies could provide some people with children who are struggling to have them, but it comes at a cost of valuing persons in an entirely commercial way. Outcomes are important because markets are a means to the end of satisfying the wants of people. The conclusion may be that market freedoms definitely give rise to a market order but, given the wants of people in a fallen world, whether it is always the best order for human beings (as indicated by Christian anthropology) needs further consideration (Hay 1989).\n\nThree features of the market order are deleterious, according to a Christian understanding of flourishing. First, a well-understood problem in mainstream economics is that the existence of so-called externalities (unintended knock-on effects in market interactions) like pollution render the information transmitted by market prices misleading, leading to more pollution than is socially desirable. Not that this is without some remedy - there is a large area of government involvement in the economy designed to deal with externalities, using such policy tools as penalties, taxes and subsidies. Some of the best contributions to human flourishing that the discipline of economics makes is in these areas. Developing markets for \u2018rights to pollute\u2019 is a prime example of a helpful social convention, developed by economists to limit pollution to its most necessary sources.\n\nThe second concerns the scope of market activities. From around the 1980s a vision of economics advocated by the so-called Chicago School has sought to bring market thinking and new markets themselves to bear on an ever-widening set of social interactions. For example, some members of the Chicago School advocate a market for adoptive babies (Landes and Posner 1978). The moral issue here is \u2018alienability\u2019, a legal term meaning that the thing which bears that designation is separable from a person: one can sell one\u2019s computer because it is alienable, but one can\u2019t (for now) sell children. Menzies (2021) argues that the sexual revolution has taken sexual partners from a kind of inalienability and placed them in the category of \u2018alienable\u2019 things.\n\nThird, this ever-widening use of markets may have the effect on society of an over-use of market values (especially given the increasingly contested nature of other sources of value) and an over-use of consequentialist ethics, expressed as a preference for cost-benefit analysis in all situations. This has been particularly damaging as the ethics of the sexual revolution have taken on a more and more \u2018contractual\u2019 flavour (Menzies 2021). It has also led to a decline in trustworthiness in the financial sector (Menzies et al. 2019), contributing to several financial crises (Jensen, 2009).\n\nPerhaps the most destructive effect of these market values comes via wages. This impact is important for non-paid work, or other pursuits so central to human flourishing. A feature of economic growth is that the average person, surrounded by an ever-increasing stock of knowledge and capital, becomes more and more productive over time. This implies a rise in wage rates in the market economy, and it can lead to a starving of time for family, the environment (think how time-consuming repairing old items, and recycling, can be) and church/community activities. While it is always possible to ignore market valuations, many people cannot resist undersupplying the goods and services which need their non-market time.\n\nMarkets are a feature of human society for which thanks to God is due. Their ability to organize so many of the goods that are necessary for both survival and flourishing is their strongest recommendation. This puts them in a genus of many other blessings that have a kind of \u2018engineering\u2019 quality to them \u2013 well-managed water and sewerage systems, toilets, and roads, to name a few. But they are also a wrong solution to a post-Fall problem of disordered desires and inappropriate values. Some things, like beautiful living spaces or clean housing for poor people, are under-valued. And markets exist for intrinsically evil things. Leaving aside the goods themselves, a \u2018market mindset\u2019 can so easily creep into other areas of society, like relationships, in the absence of both godly order and values. Markets can be regulated, defining a ministry for Christians and others of goodwill in government, and their more morally dubious offerings can be declined, most of the time, limiting their malevolent role. But markets providing morally good things can be celebrated, defining a ministry for Christians and other of goodwill to do good by doing business. For all the benefits of markets, \u2018caveat emptor\u2019 (\u201clet the buyer beware\u201d) is not just good advice for consumers, but for the \u2018purchasers\u2019 of a certain vision of economics that has no narrative of the Fall, or a bad choices in a tragic world.\n\nGriffiths, Brian (1982), Morality and the Market, Hodder, Ecclesia Books, London.\n\nGriffiths, Brian (1984), The Creation of Wealth: A Christian\u2019s Case for Capitalism , Hodder and Stoughton, London.\n\nBrian Griffiths is a Christian writer sympathetic to Free Market Liberalism, and feels it is compatible with Christianity.

[\u00a01\u00a0] Biggar\u2019s thesis that, \u201cModern Western culture warms to freedom and shies away from order... Different histories, however, produce different biases,\u201d is invigorating. As he briefly mentions:\n\nAs part of the GFI mission to promote cross-disciplinary conversation, I examine Confucian \u201corder\u201d and ethics from the perspective of a Pauline Christian theology. Given the misunderstanding, divisiveness and, at times, toxic geopolitical reality today, my essay aims not only for clarity on different understandings of order, but it also seeks a meaningful cross-cultural conversation that is complementary and offers constructive counter-points, hopefully in the spirit of Biggar\u2019s \u201ctense consensus.\u201d I locate this paper and its implications for our current geopolitical world by alerting us neither to adopt a binary view of East-West nor a simplistic view of the Bible as a product of the West, just as I resist assumptions that Confucianism is relevant only to the East. In cross-cultural conversation I find unhelpful the uncritical use in many academic writings (without quotation marks and without qualifications) of the word \u201cWest\u201d or \u201cWestern\u201d because such usage blurs nuances of both the geographic and ideological aspects of the \u201cChristian\u201d West, and spawns an equally na\u00efve exaggeration of \u201cEast-rise West-demise\u201d ( dong-shen-xi-jiang \u6771\u5347\u897f\u964d) propaganda as a supposed new world order today.\n\nThe dialogue between the two orders depicted in the Bible and by Confucius is possible because Confucius is \u201creligious but not theistic,\u201d as Louden concludes. [\u00a02\u00a0] Louden explains that, \u201c \u2026 [Confucius\u2019s] tian \u5929/heaven is part of the cosmos itself and thus naturalistic. But tian also serves as the ground of moral norms, and the wise feel a sense of awe in contemplating it. In this latter sense, tian is both transcendent and religious.\u201d [\u00a03\u00a0] Additionally, a constructive conversation is possible because I pick up a hopeful cue from Biggar:\n\nLikewise, I hope the Confucian order and ethic can be similarly received by Christian theology, and vice versa, although Confucius\u2019 understanding of tian /heaven is surely different from that of the biblical monotheistic God.\n\nIn the creation of the universe biblical narrative, history begins with God, specifically the creation of order as God\u2019s speech, light, and love overcome void, formlessness, and chaos. It is a divine story of God\u2019s power whose Spirit infuses in his creation, including human creatures. In Confucian China, however, history begins with the order ( li 1 \u7406) of things, but that order does not overcome chaos. There is neither beginning nor ending in this order of the universe, as it has always been there\u2014the \u201cself-so\u201d ( ziran \u81ea\u7136) cosmos, the world as it is and exists by itself according to the principle of changes and creativity therein. Thus, \u201call things\u201d ( wanxiang \u842c\u8c61), including chaos, can co-exist with order because chaos is a part of the order. In other words, in an ancient Chinese cyclical worldview of viewing all things in constant change, chaos and order are thought to exist in a dynamic relationship of yin and yang whose mutual interaction (and transformation termed hua \u5316) brings forth all life forms and their harmony.\n\nThe God of the Bible is often referred to as \u201cHeaven,\u201d as a metonym (i.e., an expression used as a substitute for which it is closely associated such as \u201ccrown\u201d signifying \u201cking\u201d). But in classical Chinese, heaven ( tian ) is the world or the cosmos. Ames and Rosemont rephrase this Confucian idea that \u201c Tian is both what our world is and how it is ... Tian is both the creator and the field of creatures. There is no apparent distinction between the order itself and what orders it...\u201d [\u00a04\u00a0]\n\nYet Confucian thought does view the transcendent nature of heaven as benevolence or humaneness ( ren 2 \u4ec1) of the moral order, and heaven\u2019s immanent nature is expressed in human nature as virtues. [\u00a05\u00a0] Tian /heaven in Confucianism is as \u201cnatural\u201d as the natural world is, but less personal than the human world. Heaven is the Creator but it does not spring from a creative and redemptive narrative. Perhaps, because of such connotations of tian /heaven, Chinese Bible translators never use the word tian for God except for the phrase \u201cKingdom of tian /heaven\u201d which is understood as a metonym.\n\nA more precise and common Chinese word that speaks of \u201corder\u201d is dao \u9053 (the way), made popular to present-day Chinese readers by the translation of the Greek word logos into dao in the Gospel of John. Here the cross-linguistic translation works better than tian , because cross-cultural expression and interpretation are able to complement what is lacking in another language or culture. For example, \u201cthe way,\u201d conceived both as dao and logos , is not a static entity, but is relational. The Confucian and Daoist understanding of dao is similar to the Greek understanding of logos in that both view the cosmos as an organic orderly whole. Dao and logos are used to designate the creative principle, or wisdom, that generates that way of life which is harmonious and fulsome.\n\nThe Chinese understanding of dao as the concrete way to express the transcendent can offer a corrective to a biblical faith that divides belief and practice (\u201cfaith without works,\u201d James 2:14). The Chinese understanding of dao as the way which originates in the ultimately timeless and unknown reality can be counterpointed and even completed by Paul\u2019s assertation that God has been made known in Christ. Yet, when a Christian interpretation comes short of the cosmic vision of God\u2019s works (such as, \u201cGod so loved the cosmos \u201d in John 3:16, which is commonly understood outside Confucian thought as \u201cGod so loved human beings\u201d), then the Chinese Christian perspective of dao (way) is helpful. It views freedom as being in tune with the universe by overcoming powers of bondage, sin, and death through reconciliation with God and people, as ordered by dao /Jesus Christ (John 1).\n\nConfucius is able to transfer the \u201cmandate of heaven\u201d from being the highly political prerogative of the ruling family to one that is universally appropriate within Chinese societies. Confucius seeks to democratize the elitist political mandate of tian so that that political leaders cultivate virtues as the way to rule and to underwrite their legitimacy to power. Common people may also attain the virtuous life in honor of tian . Such a hermeneutical strategy of inverting and equalizing \u201cthe elect, the predestined\u201d with outsiders, the rich and the poor, the powerful and the weak, \u201cthe civilized\u201d and \u201cthe barbarians,\u201d can be found in the biblical narratives as well, most vividly in Paul\u2019s theology of the body of Christ (1 Cor 12) and the democratization of the spiritual gifts (1 Cor 12-14) that affirm the egalitarian vision of a believing community. Paul\u2019s understanding of apostleship (Rom 1:5: \u201cThrough Christ we receive grace and apostleship . . . \u201d) points to that, yet Paul\u2019s hermeneutic seems to bring laity up to the higher status of \u201cambassadors\u201d of Christ\u2019s Kingdom. This stands in contrast with Confucius\u2019 hermeneutic of requiring the sage rulers to be virtuous like any human being should. [\u00a06\u00a0] Unfortunately, in Chinese history, Confucius\u2019 teaching is often ignored or abused, and the opposite result obtains among the ruler-cults of later dynasties, such that a \u201cConfucian\u201d ethic is coopted by imperial ideologies. Thus, Chinese Christian theology needs to recover the Confucian ideal of zheng (\u653fto govern) and wuwei (\u7121\u70bawithout force), to follow Confucian thought that government is a form of ruling by means of virtue (de \u5fb7 ) rather than by force. This is consistent with Paul\u2019s political theology in Romans 13 that requires governing authorities to be \u201cdeacons\u201d ( diakonos , 13:4) of God to serve the people and to be \u201cliturgists\u201d ( leitourgoi , 13:6) in praise of the glory of God for the common good in the Roman empire.\n\nIn response to the problems of violence, fallenness, and brokenness, Confucius urges an ethical response to be benevolent ( ren 2 \u4ec1), respectful ( jing \u656c), trustworthy ( xin \u4fe1), and empathetic ( min \u61ab). In Paul\u2019s theology the problem with the world is not the moral order, but sin, a broken relationship with the Creator, God. That relationship can only be restored by faith, which itself is a gift of divine grace. A Chinese Christian understanding of order is theological-moral , that is: to begin with Paul\u2019s theological understanding of evil as opposing good in God\u2019s created order, and then follow with Confucian moral order. While Paul does not say human nature itself is evil, he believes the power of sin holds humans captive and therefore human beings by themselves are impotent to will and realize good. In Pauline theology, \u201cAdam\u2019s (first) sin\u201d is the representation of human depravity and of the captivating power of sin in the fallen world. In the Chinese Bible, though, sin is translated as zui \u7f6a (\u201ccrime\u201d or criminal behavior or \u201cfallen\u201d relationship), begging the question as to whether the definition is ethical or theological, or both. To Confucianists, sin refers to social conflicts, wrong-doings, and insincerity toward heaven, but sin does not refer to one\u2019s existential estrangement with tian . [\u00a07\u00a0] The \u201cfall\u201d for Confucius is ritual impropriety, moral collapse, decadent music, that is, the fallen culture that drifts away from the cosmic order of life. Thus a Chinese Christian theological-moral understanding of cosmic order would explain more fully both humanity\u2019s falling away from God and fallen cultures as the departure from God\u2019s created order.\n\nMoral order and theological order need each other. There is ample evidence in the Bible that monotheistic faith still easily slips into faithlessness, disobedience and vice (see the prophetic books in the Old Testament); sacrifices and rituals do not necessarily bring about virtues and mercy and justice (Hosea 6:6). A Confucian ethic can be helpful to Christians, for Confucius understands the cosmic order ( tianli 1 \u5929\u7406) as a moral law, and he emphasizes throughout his ethical teaching the necessity of ren 2 (\u4ec1compassion) and li 2 (\u79aerites) in being human. Paul likewise points out the danger of (especially monotheistic) religious faith and zeal without a neighborly-love ethic: he was \u201cextremely zealous for the traditions of my fathers . . . [and yet] violently persecuting the church of God and was trying to destroy it\u201d (Gal 1:14), and \u201cas to zeal, a persecutor of the church . . . though blameless under the law\u201d (Phil 3:6). For Chinese Christians, a Confucian ethic is a constant reminder that religious piety and moral order are on the same horizon and significance\u2014\u201cthe second is like the first\u201d in the two commandments of love God and love one\u2019s neighbor (Matt 22:39).\n\nBesides transforming the mandate of heaven from a political idea to a moral privilege of all people, Confucius also transforms the meaning of tian and its mandate into a moral principle of goodness and beauty, as seen from the two key Confucian semantics: li 2 (\u79aeritual or propriety) and yue (\u6a02aesthetic delight or music). On this point, a cross-cultural conversation can be most amicable. The biblical text has a wealth of wisdom on rituals in worship or social lives (Psalms, Proverbs, prayers, Baptism, Eucharist, etc), [\u00a08\u00a0] and the Confucian deliberation on how li 2 and yue play in forming individual and community is prevalent.\n\nIt is fruitful for Chinese Christians to theologize their Confucian resources on li 2 and yue in order to reinforce the construction of a Christian order that embraces worship, social life, and justice, as Biggar also advocates from his Christian tradition:\n\nConfucius\u2019 understanding of li 2 (rituals) reflects his concern for a particular order within a patriarchal society. Confucius believes that music and rituals can harmonize heaven and earth and bring about the moral order called dao (the way). Thus, the Book of Ritual reads, \u201cThose who know music will integrate with rituals. Once one has music and rituals, one has virtue ( de \u5fb7).\u201d [\u00a09\u00a0]\n\nThe pentatonic music of ancient China emulates the order and sound of nature. [\u00a010\u00a0] One of the oldest Chinese musical instruments, qin \u7434\u2014a zither with five or seven strings tuned to the pentatonic scale ( gong , shang , jiao , zheng , yu \u5bae, \u5546, \u89d2, \u5fb5, \u7fbd)\u2014is thought to be capable of producing natural pitches. [\u00a011\u00a0] The ancient qin in China was customarily played in the progression of listening with the ears ( erting \u8033\u807d, hearing) to listening with the heart ( xinting \u5fc3\u807d, sensing) to ultimately listening with qi /energy ( qiting \u6c23\u807d, be transformed). [\u00a012\u00a0]\n\nIn ancient China, harmony is understood as a cosmic ordering and union , for there is a patterning or structure in relationships that produces harmony and joy in the social and spiritual world within the universe. Likewise, the word \u201charmony\u201d in Greek means \u201cfitting together,\u201d and originally refers to joining pieces of wood. Musical harmony is the agreeable adjustment of opposites (e.g., high and low pitches), of different tones (such as the triad to create the consonance of the octave). By analogy, social harmony, such as the church community, is the agreeable adjustment of opposing interests and diversity of gifts among the community. When believers or mixed ethnic groups sing in a choir, the experience of producing a harmony and still hearing different unique voices is not only musically but also a bodily expression of diversity in solidarity. That is one example of how music can cultivate the virtue of empathy for each other as we contemplate how to co-exist in a world of differences.\n\nI wonder why Christians are suspicious or even reject popular music of their day (such as jazz, rock, African drum beat as the \u201cdevil\u2019s chord\u201d) rather than engaging in a cross-cultural understanding of what they are hearing. Confucius uses music and musical metaphors to illustrate the life of virtue, since music plays a significant role in shaping human nature: \u201cA person ( ren 1 \u4eba) without ren 2 \u4ec1 (humaneness) has nothing to do with music\u201d ( Analects 3:3; my translation). Confucius also uses music to express beauty and goodness in the ritualizing process of becoming human . Goodness is based on moral propriety; beauty is expressed in the musical style of propriety. Music can cultivate a person toward perfection, as Analects 8:8 reads, \u201cBe stimulated by the Odes [the Classic of Poetry ], be established in the rites ( li 2 ), and be perfected in music ( yue )\u201d (my translation). [\u00a013\u00a0] Music and rites cannot go without each other.\n\nChinese Christians name Baptism and the Eucharist as \u201choly rites \u8056\u79ae,\u201d bringing together a Confucian ethic and Pauline theology. In Pauline Christianity, the acts of disrobing, immersion, and robing in a baptismal rite symbolize the believers\u2019 \u201cdying and rising with Christ\u201d (Gal 2:19, 5:24, 6:14). Through baptism that symbolizes the new world-order ushered in by Christ, \u201creligious and social distinctions between Jews and Greeks, slaves and freemen, men and women\u201d [\u00a014\u00a0] are abolished, thereby celebrating the moral and theological identities of the early church as one in Christ, that is, diversity in unity, and separate parts brought together in harmony.\n\nIt seems to me that the two orders, Confucian and biblical, are radically different in their own histories. Nevertheless, a mutually helpful conversation exists between them and needs to be promoted. It may be that rather than seeking to mesh the two orders into one, or rejecting one or the other, they can mutually qualify and strengthen each other. Confucian tian /heaven does care for the creation, but it acts without direct involvement with humanity. This seemingly \u201cweak\u201d human agency is reflected in the lack of personhood of tian /heaven\u2014thus making its religious meaning implicit or absent. Yet, one can find explicit human agency in the prevalent discussion of Confucian ethics. The mandates of heaven ( tianming \u5929\u547d) in Confucian thought are heavenly rules and moral principles in accordance with the natural order of things. For Confucius \u201cinner virtue is not always rewarded with external goods, which means that, the true servant of heaven should focus solely upon his virtue and leave its recompense to fate [ ming \u547d] (4:9, 4:14, 4:16, 11:18, 12:4\u20135, 14:36; 15:32).\u201d [\u00a015\u00a0]\n\nThis essay does not have space to discuss whether tianming as fate is a nihilist idea or is rooted in tian as the source of benevolence ( Analects 9:12)? In Pauline theology, though, there is a profound clarity that one speaks of the sovereign will of God as predestination (in-Christ and God as \u201cAll in all\u201d) but not predeterminism (Rom 8:28\u201330) of God\u2019s will as salvation and sanctification (1 Thess 4), and of God as love (Rom 5:8).

There is no apparent distinction between the order itself and what orders it...\u201d<a class=\"anchor\" id=\"content100note4anc\" name=\"content100note4anc\">\u00a0</a><a class=\"note\" href=\"#content100note4sym\">[\u00a04\u00a0]</a></p>\n<p>Yet Confucian thought does view the transcendent nature of heaven as benevolence or humaneness (<i>ren</i><sup>2</sup> \u4ec1) of the moral order, and heaven\u2019s immanent nature is expressed in human nature as virtues.<a class=\"anchor\" id=\"content100note5anc\" name=\"content100note5anc\">\u00a0</a><a class=\"note\" href=\"#content100note5sym\">[\u00a05\u00a0]</a> <i>Tian</i>/heaven in Confucianism is as \u201cnatural\u201d as the natural world is, but less personal than the human world. Heaven is the Creator but it does not spring from a creative and redemptive narrative. Perhaps, because of such connotations of <i>tian</i>/heaven, Chinese Bible translators never use the word <i>tian</i> for God except for the phrase \u201cKingdom of <i>tian</i>/heaven\u201d which is understood as a metonym.</p>\n<p>A more precise and common Chinese word that speaks of \u201corder\u201d is <i>dao</i> \u9053 (the way), made popular to present-day Chinese readers by the translation of the Greek word <i>logos</i> into <i>dao</i> in the Gospel of John. Here the cross-linguistic translation works better than <i>tian</i>, because cross-cultural expression and interpretation are able to complement what is lacking in another language or culture. For example, \u201cthe way,\u201d conceived both as <i>dao</i> and<i> logos</i>, is not a static entity, but is relational. The Confucian and Daoist understanding of <i>dao</i> is similar to the Greek understanding of <i>logos </i>in that both view the cosmos as an organic orderly whole. <i>Dao</i> and <i>logos</i> are used to designate the creative principle, or wisdom, that generates that <i>way</i> of life which is harmonious and fulsome.</p>\n<p>The Chinese understanding of <i>dao </i>as the<i> </i>concrete<i> way </i>to express the transcendent can offer a corrective to a biblical faith that divides belief and practice (\u201cfaith without works,\u201d James 2:14). The Chinese understanding of <i>dao</i> as the way which originates in the ultimately timeless and unknown reality can be counterpointed and even completed by Paul\u2019s assertation that God has been made known in Christ. Yet, when a Christian interpretation comes short of the cosmic vision of God\u2019s works (such as, \u201cGod so loved the <i>cosmos</i>\u201d in John 3:16, which is commonly understood outside Confucian thought as \u201cGod so loved human beings\u201d), then the Chinese Christian perspective of <i>dao</i> (way) is helpful. It views freedom as being in tune with the universe by overcoming powers of bondage, sin, and death through reconciliation with God and people, as ordered by <i>dao</i>/Jesus Christ (John 1).</p>\n<h2>The Transformation of Political and Moral Orders</h2>\n<p>Confucius is able to transfer the \u201cmandate of heaven\u201d from being the highly political prerogative of the ruling family to one that is universally appropriate within Chinese societies. Confucius seeks to democratize the elitist political mandate of <i>tian</i> so that that political leaders cultivate virtues as the way to rule and to underwrite their legitimacy to power. Common people may also attain the virtuous life in honor of <i>tian</i>. Such a hermeneutical strategy of inverting and equalizing \u201cthe elect, the predestined\u201d with outsiders, the rich and the poor, the powerful and the weak, \u201cthe civilized\u201d and \u201cthe barbarians,\u201d can be found in the biblical narratives as well, most vividly in Paul\u2019s theology of the body of Christ (1 Cor 12) and the democratization of the spiritual gifts (1 Cor 12-14) that affirm the egalitarian vision of a believing community. Paul\u2019s understanding of apostleship (Rom 1:5: \u201cThrough Christ we receive grace and apostleship . . . \u201d) points to that, yet Paul\u2019s hermeneutic seems to bring laity up to the higher status of \u201cambassadors\u201d of Christ\u2019s Kingdom. This stands in contrast with Confucius\u2019 hermeneutic of <i>requiring</i> the sage rulers to be virtuous like any human being should.<a class=\"anchor\" id=\"content100note6anc\" name=\"content100note6anc\">\u00a0</a><a class=\"note\" href=\"#content100note6sym\">[\u00a06\u00a0]</a> Unfortunately, in Chinese history, Confucius\u2019 teaching is often ignored or abused, and the opposite result obtains among the ruler-cults of later dynasties, such that a \u201cConfucian\u201d ethic is coopted by imperial ideologies. Thus, Chinese Christian theology needs to recover the Confucian ideal of <i>zheng</i> (\u653fto govern) and <i>wuwei</i> (\u7121\u70bawithout force), to follow Confucian thought that government is a form of ruling by means of virtue <i>(de</i> \u5fb7<i>)</i> rather than by force. This is consistent with Paul\u2019s political theology in Romans 13 that requires governing authorities to be \u201cdeacons\u201d (<i>diakonos</i>, 13:4) of God to serve<i> the people</i> and to be \u201cliturgists\u201d (<i>leitourgoi</i>, 13:6) in praise of the glory of God for the <i>common good</i> in the Roman empire.</p>\n<p>In response to the problems of violence, fallenness, and brokenness, Confucius urges an <i>ethical</i> response to be benevolent (<i>ren</i><sup>2 </sup>\u4ec1), respectful (<i>jing </i>\u656c), trustworthy (<i>xin </i>\u4fe1), and empathetic (<i>min </i>\u61ab). In Paul\u2019s <i>theology</i> the problem with the world is not the moral order, but sin, a broken relationship with the Creator, God. That relationship can only be restored by faith, which itself is a gift of divine grace. A Chinese Christian understanding of order is <i>theological-moral</i>, that is: to begin with Paul\u2019s theological understanding of evil as opposing good in God\u2019s created order, and then follow with Confucian moral order. While Paul does not say human nature itself is evil, he believes the power of sin holds humans captive and therefore human beings by themselves are impotent to will and realize good. In Pauline theology, \u201cAdam\u2019s (first) sin\u201d is the representation of human depravity and of the captivating power of sin in the fallen world. In the Chinese Bible, though, sin is translated as <i>zui</i> \u7f6a (\u201ccrime\u201d or criminal behavior or \u201cfallen\u201d relationship), begging the question as to whether the definition is ethical or theological, or both. To Confucianists, sin refers to social conflicts, wrong-doings, and insincerity toward heaven, but sin does not refer to one\u2019s existential estrangement with <i>tian</i>.<a class=\"anchor\" id=\"content100note7anc\" name=\"content100note7anc\">\u00a0</a><a class=\"note\" href=\"#content100note7sym\">[\u00a07\u00a0]</a> The \u201cfall\u201d for Confucius is ritual impropriety, moral collapse, decadent music, that is, the fallen culture that drifts away from the cosmic order of life. Thus a Chinese Christian <i>theological-moral</i> understanding of cosmic order would explain more fully both humanity\u2019s falling away from God and fallen cultures as the departure from God\u2019s created order.</p>\n<p>Moral order and theological order need each other. There is ample evidence in the Bible that monotheistic faith still easily slips into faithlessness, disobedience and vice (see the prophetic books in the Old Testament); sacrifices and rituals do not necessarily bring about virtues and mercy and justice (Hosea 6:6). A Confucian ethic can be helpful to Christians, for Confucius understands the cosmic order (<i>tianli</i><sup>1 </sup>\u5929\u7406) as a moral law, and he emphasizes throughout his ethical teaching the necessity of <i>ren</i><sup>2</sup> (\u4ec1compassion) and <i>li</i><sup>2</sup> (\u79aerites) in being human. Paul likewise points out the danger of (especially monotheistic) religious faith and zeal without a neighborly-love ethic: he was \u201cextremely zealous for the traditions of my fathers . . . [and yet] violently persecuting the church of God and was trying to destroy it\u201d (Gal 1:14), and \u201cas to zeal, a persecutor of the church . . . though blameless under the law\u201d (Phil 3:6). For Chinese Christians, a Confucian ethic is a constant reminder that religious piety and moral order are on the same horizon and significance\u2014\u201cthe second is like the first\u201d in the two commandments of love God <i>and</i> love one\u2019s neighbor (Matt 22:39).</p>\n<h2>Ritual, Music, and Moral Order</h2>\n<p>Besides transforming the mandate of heaven from a political idea to a moral privilege of all people, Confucius also transforms the meaning of <i>tian</i> and its mandate into a moral principle of goodness and beauty, as seen from the two key Confucian semantics: <i>li</i><sup>2 </sup>(\u79aeritual or propriety) and <i>yue</i> (\u6a02aesthetic delight or music). On this point, a cross-cultural conversation can be most amicable. The biblical text has a wealth of wisdom on rituals in worship or social lives (Psalms, Proverbs, prayers, Baptism, Eucharist, etc),<a class=\"anchor\" id=\"content100note8anc\" name=\"content100note8anc\">\u00a0</a><a class=\"note\" href=\"#content100note8sym\">[\u00a08\u00a0]</a> and the Confucian deliberation on how <i>li</i><sup>2</sup><i> </i>and <i>yue </i>play in forming individual and community is prevalent.</p>\n<p>It is fruitful for Chinese Christians to theologize their Confucian resources on <i>li</i><sup>2</sup><i> </i>and <i>yue </i>in order to reinforce the construction of a Christian order that embraces worship, social life, and justice, as Biggar also advocates from his Christian tradition:</p>\n<blockquote>The confession of sins, participation in the eucharistic reprise of the Last Supper ... and prayer for the final coming of God\u2019s kingdom will be viewed as essential spiritual remedies, which enable sinners to defend and promote goods\u2026 In particular, contemplation of the Cross will make patience in suffering, not martial valour, the paradigm of the virtue of fortitude; and receiving the bread of fellowship \u2026 will dispose the communicant to put forgiveness at the heart of doing justice.</blockquote>\n<p>Confucius\u2019 understanding of <i>li</i><sup>2</sup> (rituals) reflects his concern for a particular order within a patriarchal society. Confucius believes that music and rituals can harmonize heaven and earth and bring about the moral order called <i>dao</i> (the way). Thus, the <i>Book of Ritual</i> reads, \u201cThose who know music will integrate with rituals. Once one has music and rituals, one has virtue (<i>de</i>\u5fb7).\u201d<a class=\"anchor\" id=\"content100note9anc\" name=\"content100note9anc\">\u00a0</a><a class=\"note\" href=\"#content100note9sym\">[\u00a09\u00a0]</a></p>\n<p><a name=\"OLE_LINK22\"></a><a name=\"OLE_LINK21\"></a> The pentatonic music of ancient China emulates the order and sound of nature.<a class=\"anchor\" id=\"content100note10anc\" name=\"content100note10anc\">\u00a0</a><a class=\"note\" href=\"#content100note10sym\">[\u00a010\u00a0]</a> One of the oldest Chinese musical instruments, <i>qin </i>\u7434\u2014a zither with five or seven strings tuned to the pentatonic scale (<i>gong</i>, <i>shang</i>, <i>jiao</i>, <i>zheng</i>, <i>yu </i>\u5bae, \u5546, \u89d2, \u5fb5, \u7fbd)\u2014is thought to be capable of producing natural pitches.<a class=\"anchor\" id=\"content100note11anc\" name=\"content100note11anc\">\u00a0</a><a class=\"note\" href=\"#content100note11sym\">[\u00a011\u00a0]</a> The ancient <i>qin</i> in China was customarily played in the progression of listening with the ears (<i>erting </i>\u8033\u807d, hearing) to listening with the heart (<i>xinting</i>\u5fc3\u807d, sensing) to ultimately listening with <i>qi</i>/energy<i> </i>(<i>qiting</i>\u6c23\u807d, be transformed).<a class=\"anchor\" id=\"content100note12anc\" name=\"content100note12anc\">\u00a0</a><a class=\"note\" href=\"#content100note12sym\">[\u00a012\u00a0]</a></p>\n<p>In ancient China, harmony is understood as a cosmic <i>ordering</i> and <i>union</i>, for there is a patterning or structure in relationships that produces harmony and joy in the social and spiritual world within the universe. Likewise, the word \u201charmony\u201d in Greek means \u201cfitting together,\u201d and originally refers to joining pieces of wood. Musical harmony is the agreeable adjustment of opposites (e.g., high and low pitches), of different tones (such as the triad to create the consonance of the octave). By analogy, social harmony, such as the church community, is the agreeable adjustment of opposing interests and diversity of gifts among the community. When believers or mixed ethnic groups sing in a choir, the experience of producing a harmony and still hearing different unique voices is not only musically but also a bodily expression of diversity in solidarity. That is one example of how music can cultivate the virtue of empathy for each other as we contemplate how to co-exist in a world of differences.</p>\n<p>I wonder why Christians are suspicious or even reject popular music of their day (such as jazz, rock, African drum beat as the \u201cdevil\u2019s chord\u201d) rather than engaging in a cross-cultural understanding of what they are hearing. Confucius uses music and musical metaphors to illustrate the life of virtue, since music plays a significant role in shaping human nature: \u201cA person (<i>ren</i><sup>1</sup>\u4eba) without<i> ren</i><sup>2</sup><i> </i>\u4ec1 (humaneness) has nothing to do with music\u201d (<i>Analects</i> 3:3; my translation). Confucius also uses music to express beauty and goodness in the <i>ritualizing process of becoming human</i>. Goodness is based on moral propriety; beauty is expressed in the musical style of propriety. Music can cultivate a person toward perfection, as <i>Analects</i> 8:8 reads, \u201cBe stimulated by the <i>Odes</i> [the <i>Classic of Poetry</i>], be established in the rites (<i>li</i><sup>2</sup>), and be perfected in music (<i>yue</i>)\u201d (my translation).<a class=\"anchor\" id=\"content100note13anc\" name=\"content100note13anc\">\u00a0</a><a class=\"note\" href=\"#content100note13sym\">[\u00a013\u00a0]</a> Music and rites cannot go without each other.</p>\n<p>Chinese Christians name Baptism and the Eucharist as \u201choly rites \u8056\u79ae,\u201d bringing together a Confucian ethic and Pauline theology. In Pauline Christianity, the acts of disrobing, immersion, and robing in a baptismal rite symbolize the believers\u2019 \u201cdying and rising with Christ\u201d (Gal 2:19, 5:24, 6:14). Through baptism that symbolizes the new world-order ushered in by Christ, \u201creligious and social distinctions between Jews and Greeks, slaves and freemen, men and women\u201d<a class=\"anchor\" id=\"content100note14anc\" name=\"content100note14anc\">\u00a0</a><a class=\"note\" href=\"#content100note14sym\">[\u00a014\u00a0]</a> are abolished, thereby celebrating the moral and theological identities of the early church as one in Christ, that is, diversity in unity, and separate parts brought together in harmony.</p>\n<h2>Conclusion</h2>\n<p>It seems to me that the two orders, Confucian and biblical, are radically different in their own histories. Nevertheless, a mutually helpful conversation exists between them and needs to be promoted. It may be that rather than seeking to mesh the two orders into one, or rejecting one or the other, they can mutually qualify and strengthen each other. Confucian <i>tian</i>/heaven does care for the creation, but it acts without direct involvement with humanity. This seemingly \u201cweak\u201d human agency is reflected in the lack of personhood of <i>tian</i>/heaven\u2014thus making its religious meaning implicit or absent. Yet, one can find explicit human agency in the prevalent discussion of Confucian ethics. The mandates of heaven<i> </i>(<i>tianming </i>\u5929\u547d) in Confucian thought are heavenly rules and moral principles in accordance with the natural order of things. For Confucius \u201cinner virtue is not always rewarded with external goods, which means that, the true servant of heaven should focus solely upon his virtue and leave its recompense to fate [<i>ming </i>\u547d] (4:9, 4:14, 4:16, 11:18, 12:4\u20135, 14:36; 15:32).\u201d<a class=\"anchor\" id=\"content100note15anc\" name=\"content100note15anc\">\u00a0</a><a class=\"note\" href=\"#content100note15sym\">[\u00a015\u00a0]</a><i> </i></p>\n<p>This essay does not have space to discuss whether <i>tianming</i> as <i>fate</i> is a nihilist idea or is rooted in <i>tian</i> as the source of benevolence (<i>Analects</i> 9:12)? In Pauline theology, though, there is a profound clarity that one speaks of the sovereign will of God as predestination (in-Christ and God as \u201cAll in all\u201d) but not predeterminism (Rom 8:28\u201330) of God\u2019s will as salvation and sanctification (1 Thess 4), and of God as love (Rom 5:8).<a class=\"anchor\" id=\"content100note16anc\" name=\"content100note16anc\">\u00a0</a><a class=\"note\" href=\"#content100note16sym\">[\u00a016\u00a0]</a></p>\n<h2 class=\"new_page\">End Notes</h2>\n<p class=\"endnote\"><a class=\"note\" href=\"#content100note1anc\">[\u00a01\u00a0]</a><a class=\"anchor\" id=\"content100note1sym\" name=\"content100note1sym\">\u00a0</a> For more, see K.

In the Christian tradition Jesus Christ did not stick to his godly dignity, but he became human. In doing so, he shared the vulnerable existence of human beings. [\u00a01\u00a0] Through this act of solidarity he shows who God is and points to humanity as the eminent way to salvation. In involving himself in the lives of ordinary (or \u2018lay\u2019) people, Jesus expresses his solidarity with them and his promise of ultimate healing and eschatological sanctification. Jesus is the exegete of God. In the gospels we learn from him what it means to be fully human [\u00a02\u00a0] and where this potentially brings us. [\u00a03\u00a0]\n\nThe kenotic dimension of the Christian revelation gives shape to a specific theology for RE. In RE we paradoxically teach \u2018letting go,\u2019 we step aside as teachers and create space for the voice of future generations and their interpretation of the good life. According to the American practical theologian Tom Beaudoin, [\u00a04\u00a0] as Christians we witness permanently this act of kenosis or \u201cdispossession,\u201d in \u201clearning to participate in handing over. Or better, learning how to rehearse through the hands what has already been given over\u201d. [\u00a05\u00a0] In this respect, the RE teacher should not \u2018transmit\u2019 or \u2018bring\u2019 the tradition, but should rather \u2018bear\u2019 the tradition. He/she does not have to inspire people, but has to gather those who are already inspired. This \u201cpractice of dispossession\u201d [\u00a06\u00a0] within RE is, according to Dietrich Bonhoeffer, a \u201cdescent into secret discipline\u201d, [\u00a07\u00a0] that is even hidden for the teacher in RE. What the child or the young person finally appropriates from the learning process, what he/she takes away as soul food from the table, cannot be planned in RE. Learning as taking away is an act of freedom. The RE teacher can only provide and prepare the table of the \u201csecret discipline\u201d.\n\nThe Catechism of the Catholic Church in # 170 acknowledges the kenotic dimension of religious tradition and religious learning. When discussing the language of faith, it argues:\n\nNon in formulas credimus, sed in res quas illae exprimunt et quas nobis fides \u2018tangere\u2019 permittit. \u201cActus autem [fidei] credentis non terminatur ad enuntiabile, sed ad rem [enuntiatam]\u201d. Tamen ad has res adiutorio formulationum fidei appropinquamus. Hae permittunt fidem exprimere et transmittere, illam in communitate celebrare, illam facere propriam et ex illa magis magisque vivere\u201d.\n\nThe translation says:\n\nWe do not have to believe in formulas, but in the soulful realities that are expressed in these formulas and that are allowed to be touched by us. The act of faith does not accumulate in what can be said, but in what can be experienced. We only use the language of faith to have access to these soulful experiences. Language is the only vehicle at our disposal to understand our faith. But nobody can stop us from accessing God in our own voice and nobody can force us to believe in God in the framework of one specific (theological) voice or language. We are allowed to access the realities of faith as children: in a deep state of vulnerability and receptivity, in our own experience of \u201crelational consciousness\u201d, without being forced and in our own right. [\u00a08\u00a0]\n\nThis is precisely what Karl Rahner meant when he argued that we need a \u201ctheology of childhood\u201d, of vulnerability and radical openness, when it comes finally to the act of faith, [\u00a09\u00a0] to the double act of \u201cde-centration and de-dication\u201d. [\u00a010\u00a0] This disposition of receptive learning, of learning with \u2018open hands\u2019 is at the center of a theology of Bildung. In this respect RE will always need to be open for encounter (communication), for personal storytelling (narration) and for the existential dimension of human life (spirituality) \u2013 briefly for the \u201cspiritual learning community\u201d. Authentic RE is in this regard always a soteriological act or an act of healing. In the end good RE restores the communication, narration, and spiritual flourishing of the person and the community.\n\n[\u00a01\u00a0] In the New Testament in Paul\u2019s Letter to the Philippians 2, 5-11.\n\n[\u00a02\u00a0] B.

There, you will not find any prophetic oracle or subtle apologetic arguments for the existence of God, but the narrative of a human being, Jesus of Nazareth. He is a loyal friend, companion, and guest at the table. He tells stories, but most of the time he listens. In his listening he becomes authoritative, because he radically places his fellow human beings in the middle (\u2026).to bring the Gospel closer to itself, where it belongs, namely into the realm of friendship where God happens\u201d.\n\n[\u00a03\u00a0] See for this idea also the apostolic exhortation of Pope Francis, Evangelii Gaudium (2013), # 133.\n\n[\u00a04\u00a0] See T.

Whereas \u2018freedom\u2019 connotes liberation, exhilaration, and vitality, \u2018order\u2019 connotes oppression, constraint, and sterility.\u2019 Modern freedom seems to define itself as an emancipation from rules, demanding a certain \u2018disobedience\u2019 to pre-established structures to assert its identity. How order and freedom relate is an aesthetic question since works of art require both elements to be in play. Music has often been a paradigmatic model to unite both elements, not simply in a composition or a performance, but in the cosmos. In the past, music theory was a cosmology.\n\nMy current work on music theory across the ancient world from Confucius to Augustine suggests various ways to conceive of order as both a form of obedience and freedom. Musical order in the ancient world was a matter of tuning. The universe was harmonious, held in proportion by mathematically beautiful ratios. To live well and govern well required humans to be tune with this cosmic harmony. This order was both pleasurable and virtuous, spontaneous and structured, joyful and tempered, exuberant and balanced.\n\nPerhaps we need to recover aspects of ancient music theory to enjoy the moral order of the created order that we have seemingly lost in modernity. How this can be done today would take too long to explain; you would need to read my book, Joy! Music Lessons on the Good Life (Yale University Press, forthcoming 2024), which will take you on an ancient tour of China, Africa and Europe to discover a new theologically inflected rhythm to order our lives today. But let me point out two words that might help to point the way forward.\n\nIn Chinese music is joy. Quite literally. The word \u2018music\u2019 in Classical Chinese is also the character \u2018joy\u2019. Although pronounced differently, the character yu\u00e8 (\u6a02\u00a0\u2013 meaning music) is the same as the character l\u00e8 (\u6a02\u00a0\u2013 meaning joy).\u00a0Music and joy are in a homographic relationship \u2013 they look the same but sound different. So every time you look at the character \u2018music\u2019 in Chinese you also see \u2018joy\u2019 (and vice versa). We could quibble over whether this homograph is merely coincidental, but both the Confucian and Daoist classics clearly equated the two meanings and aligned them with the Way (Dao). This joy is not simply a human emotion, but a disposition. As such, it guides us in the path of righteousness, keeping our temperament in balance. Joy, in this sense, is a virtue that follows a cosmic tuning that is objective and exacting. To make good music is to obey its regulations freely and joyfully. Music and joy, then, share the same \u2018being\u2019, united as a balanced and virtuous order that expresses the fundamental principles of cosmic well-being.\n\nSuch joy was not confined to ancient China. In the Jewish bible, Wisdom measured the foundations of the earth with such delight that the stars sang and the angels shouted for joy (Job 38: 4-7). Our planet was a musical measure, and a symphony of joy. Augustine, in De Musica , brought this joy to the well-proportioned cosmos of ancient music theory, and declared God, the creator of all things, to be music and the universe a hymn of praise. Creation was a doxological ecology, freely improvising within an established order. Joy, then, is the virtue that combines order and freedom in equilibrium.\n\nThe second word is \u2018nomos\u2019 (\u03bd\u03cc\u03bc\u03bf\u03c2). In Greek, nomos has two interchangeable meanings: it is both law and melody. In his Exhortation to the Pagans ( Protrepticus ), Clement of Alexandria plays with the term nomos to describe the Logos that opens the Gospel of John. In the beginning was music. For Clement, Christ is both law and melody. As the original song, the Logos sings creation into being at the beginning of time; as the \u2018new song\u2019 he sings new creation into being in the event of the incarnation; and as the instrument that sounds the new song, he will keep singing in a co-creative duet with humanity until the end of time. Nomos as law is the order of God; nomos as melody is the grace of God. It is both necessity and freedom in harmony. Being in tune with the cosmos, and singing along with the Logos , is both a natural and moral order that is disclosed by music. What music reveals in theory as order (literally a ratio -nality) and expressed and practiced as doxology is nomos in every sense of word. It is for this reason that we should contemplate music (the miracle of its existence points to something amazing about our universe) and participate in music (the music we make connects us freely and creatively to logos of the universe).",

This joy is not simply a human emotion, but a disposition. As such, it guides us in the path of righteousness, keeping our temperament in balance. Joy, in this sense, is a virtue that follows a cosmic tuning that is objective and exacting. To make good music is to obey its regulations freely and joyfully. Music and joy, then, share the same \u2018being\u2019, united as a balanced and virtuous order that expresses the fundamental principles of cosmic well-being.</p>\n<p>Such joy was not confined to ancient China. In the Jewish bible, Wisdom measured the foundations of the earth with such delight that the stars sang and the angels shouted for joy (Job 38: 4-7). Our planet was a musical measure, and a symphony of joy. Augustine, in <i>De Musica</i>, brought this joy to the well-proportioned cosmos of ancient music theory, and declared God, the creator of all things, to be music and the universe a hymn of praise. Creation was a doxological ecology, freely improvising within an established order. Joy, then, is the virtue that combines order and freedom in equilibrium.</p>\n<p>The second word is \u2018nomos\u2019 (\u03bd\u03cc\u03bc\u03bf\u03c2). In Greek, <i>nomos</i> has two interchangeable meanings: it is both law and melody. In his <i>Exhortation to the Pagans</i> (<i>Protrepticus</i>), Clement of Alexandria plays with the term <i>nomos</i> to describe the <i>Logos</i> that opens the Gospel of John. In the beginning was music. For Clement, Christ is both law and melody. As the original song, the <i>Logos</i> sings creation into being at the beginning of time; as the \u2018new song\u2019 he sings new creation into being in the event of the incarnation; and as the instrument that sounds the new song, he will keep singing in a co-creative duet with humanity until the end of time. <i>Nomos</i> as law is the order of God; <i>nomos</i> as melody is the grace of God. It is both necessity and freedom in harmony. Being in tune with the cosmos, and singing along with the <i>Logos</i>, is both a natural and moral order that is disclosed by music. What music reveals in theory as order (literally a <i>ratio</i>-nality) and expressed and practiced as doxology is <i>nomos</i> in every sense of word. It is for this reason that we should contemplate music (the miracle of its existence points to something amazing about our universe) and participate in music (the music we make connects us freely and creatively to logos of the universe).</p>"

    "bodyText": "Disciplinary Note\n\nTowards the end of his paper, Professor Biggar discusses the circumstances in which rebellion to tyrannical government might be justified. He draws attention to the principle of the Lutheran Magdeburg Confession of 1550, that such resistance, if warranted, should only be undertaken under the authority of the \u2018lesser magistrates\u2019. Helmut Thielicke, writing almost four centuries later, said that rebellion is only justified when the rebels have an alternative government ready-to-hand. The point is that resistance to unjust order may be morally justified in some circumstances, but it must avoid giving rise to sheer, anarchical disorder.\n\nThe thought I would like to develop concerns these lesser magistrates. Who are they, why do they exist and what do they imply?\n\nThe lesser magistrate is a concept that has been very important in Protestant, and especially Reformed and Calvinist, political theology. [\u00a01\u00a0] As Nigel points out, it has its roots in Thomas Aquinas, [\u00a02\u00a0] and in other medieval writers, such as John of Salisbury. [\u00a03\u00a0] It conveys the idea that there are multiple orders of government in a well-ordered society, organised in something of a hierarchy, but not an absolute hierarchy, precisely because the lower magistrates have an inherent authority to engage in lawful resistance to their tyrannical superiors.\n\nThe basis for the lawfulness of this resistance is, in part, as Nigel notes, the proposition that the hierarchy is not absolute but always relative to the ultimate authority of God. As servants of God (Rm 13), the lower of magistrates have as much responsibility to maintain justice as do their superiors.\n\nThe fullest account of the social order implied by this way of thinking was articulated by the Reformed jurist, Johannes Althusius, in his early 17th century treatise, the Politica Methodice Digesta . [\u00a04\u00a0] Althusius argued that human social order should be understood as consisting of many distinct orders of government, each of them playing their proper role, some of them private and others public, but all of them essential. The most basic he said was the family and the household, which he described like an organism which gives sustenance to its members. Beyond the family there was a second, third and fourth type of government, each supplying to the community as a whole things essential to its well-being.\n\nThe second order of government was that of the collegia , by which Althusius meant the sorts of organisations which artisans and merchants of many different kinds will develop in order to govern themselves and relate to the other organs of society.\n\nThe third was the village, and beyond that the town and ultimately the city, which provide the immediate social and political contexts in which the families and collegia live their lives and go about their business.\n\nAlthusius understood the civil order to extend, in principle, beyond the city, to a body called the province, and ultimately to the universal association of the commonwealth, a term which he used, strikingly, to designate what existed of the Holy Roman Empire of his day.\n\nThe relations of these orders of civil government were regulated, according to Althusius, by a fundamental law, under which the powers and immunities possessed by each order of government were constitutionally regulated.\n\nThe fourth order, according to Althusius, was the church, a body which itself was reticulated into particular levels of government, corresponding to those of the civil order. According to Althusius\u2019s reformed polity, the ecclesiastical order consisted of a graded system of courts, established at congregational, presbyterial, and successively more general levels.\n\nWhat such an outlook would mean for our own time and place, I have endeavoured to sketch out in some of my work. [\u00a05\u00a0] It seems to me that, whatever one\u2019s ecclesiology -- be it congregational, presbyterian, episcopalian, orthodox or catholic -- something like this many-ordered conception of human sociality is a fundamental principle of Christian political theology.\n\n[\u00a01\u00a0] See, generally, John Witte, The Reformation of Rights: Law, Religion, and Human Rights in Early Modern Calvinism (Cambridge University Press, 2007).\n\n[\u00a02\u00a0] I seek to explain this aspect of Aquinas\u2019s thought in Nicholas Aroney, \u2019Subsidiarity, Federalism and the Best Constitution: Thomas Aquinas on City, Province and Empire\u2019 (2007) 26 Law and Philosophy 161.\n\n[\u00a03\u00a0] John of Salisbury, Policraticus , tr Cary J Nederman (Cambridge University Press, 1990).\n\n[\u00a04\u00a0] Johannes Althusius, Politica: An Abridged Translation [Politica methodice digesta atque exemplis sacris & profanes illustrata] , tr Frederick Carney (Liberty Fund, 1995 [3rd ed, 1614]).\n\n[\u00a05\u00a0] Eg, Nicholas Aroney, \u2019The Federal Condition: Towards a Normative Theory\u2019 (2016) 61(1) American Journal of Jurisprudence 1-19.",

Beyond the family there was a second, third and fourth type of government, each supplying to the community as a whole things essential to its well-being.</p>\n<p>The second order of government was that of the <i>collegia</i>, by which Althusius meant the sorts of organisations which artisans and merchants of many different kinds will develop in order to govern themselves and relate to the other organs of society.</p>\n<p>The third was the village, and beyond that the town and ultimately the city, which provide the immediate social and political contexts in which the families and collegia live their lives and go about their business.</p>\n<p>Althusius understood the civil order to extend, in principle, beyond the city, to a body called the province, and ultimately to the universal association of the commonwealth, a term which he used, strikingly, to designate what existed of the Holy Roman Empire of his day.</p>\n<p>The relations of these orders of civil government were regulated, according to Althusius, by a fundamental law, under which the powers and immunities possessed by each order of government were constitutionally regulated.</p>\n<p>The fourth order, according to Althusius, was the church, a body which itself was reticulated into particular levels of government, corresponding to those of the civil order. According to Althusius\u2019s reformed polity, the ecclesiastical order consisted of a graded system of courts, established at congregational, presbyterial, and successively more general levels.</p>\n<p>What such an outlook would mean for our own time and place, I have endeavoured to sketch out in some of my work.<a class=\"anchor\" id=\"content100note5anc\" name=\"content100note5anc\">\u00a0</a><a class=\"note\" href=\"#content100note5sym\">[\u00a05\u00a0]</a> It seems to me that, whatever one\u2019s ecclesiology -- be it congregational, presbyterian, episcopalian, orthodox or catholic -- something like this many-ordered conception of human sociality is a fundamental principle of Christian political theology.</p>\n<h2 class=\"new_page\">End Notes</h2>\n<p class=\"endnote\"><a class=\"note\" href=\"#content100note1anc\">[\u00a01\u00a0]</a><a class=\"anchor\" id=\"content100note1sym\" name=\"content100note1sym\">\u00a0</a> See, generally, John Witte, <i>The Reformation of Rights: Law, Religion, and Human Rights in Early Modern Calvinism</i> (Cambridge University Press, 2007).</p>\n<p class=\"endnote\"><a class=\"note\" href=\"#content100note2anc\">[\u00a02\u00a0]</a><a class=\"anchor\" id=\"content100note2sym\" name=\"content100note2sym\">\u00a0</a> I seek to explain this aspect of Aquinas\u2019s thought in Nicholas Aroney, \u2019Subsidiarity, Federalism and the Best Constitution: Thomas Aquinas on City, Province and Empire\u2019 (2007) 26 <i>Law and Philosophy</i> 161.</p>\n<p class=\"endnote\"><a class=\"note\" href=\"#content100note3anc\">[\u00a03\u00a0]</a><a class=\"anchor\" id=\"content100note3sym\" name=\"content100note3sym\">\u00a0</a> John of Salisbury, <i>Policraticus</i>, tr Cary J Nederman (Cambridge University Press, 1990).</p>\n<p class=\"endnote\"><a class=\"note\" href=\"#content100note4anc\">[\u00a04\u00a0]</a><a class=\"anchor\" id=\"content100note4sym\" name=\"content100note4sym\">\u00a0</a> Johannes Althusius, <i>Politica: An Abridged Translation [Politica methodice digesta atque exemplis sacris &amp; profanes illustrata]</i>, tr Frederick Carney (Liberty Fund, 1995 [3rd ed, 1614]).</p>\n<p class=\"endnote\"><a class=\"note\" href=\"#content100note5anc\">[\u00a05\u00a0]</a><a class=\"anchor\" id=\"content100note5sym\" name=\"content100note5sym\">\u00a0</a> Eg, Nicholas Aroney, \u2019The Federal Condition: Towards a Normative Theory\u2019 (2016) 61(1) <i>American Journal of Jurisprudence</i> 1-19.</p>"

Examples include gratitude and forgiveness- promoting therapies that grow out of the positive psychology movement, and meaning-centered and dignity-conserving therapies designed to help the seriously medically ill. Perhaps if these goods can be seen to guide how we ought to envision a life well lived, clinicians will be less likely to slide into moral subjectivism when they encourage patients to act on the basis of their values, and even become more open to theological resources for grounding and fostering them.</p>\n<h2>Accountability as a Virtue in Psychiatric Treatment</h2>\n<p>Furthermore, while subjection to authority is a challenging notion for many clinicians who daily see how human authority has been abused, this Brief provides models for considering how structure and hierarchy can be compatible with creative freedom.

And as with the moral order, key aspects of the created order were observed and formalised in parallel with Biblical revelation and insights. For example, the Pythagorean passion for seeing mathematical harmony in the order of the cosmos had a profound influence on Plato, and on through Plato to Kepler and the scientific revolution of the 17th century in Europe. \u2019All things were together, then Mind ( nous ) came and set them in order\u2019. According to Diogenes, this was the opening of Anaxagorus\u2019s first book of his one and only treatise, the Physica .\n\nAristotle developed the ideas of earlier Greek thinkers in seeing everything that existed as having its own physis or physical nature, which thereby determined its \u2019natural\u2019 place in the hierarchical order of the universe. Aristotle\u2019s teleological stance was vigorously continued, now in a Christianised form, by Galen of Pergamum (AD 131-201), whose extensive writings on biology and medicine were translated into Latin, Syriac, Arabic and Hebrew. But it was really amongst the European Christian natural philosophers of the 17 th century that the cosmic order of the universe impacted most profoundly upon their thinking and upon the emergence of what we now call modern science.\n\nAs Newton wrote in his Principia Mathematica (1687): \u2018the most beautiful system of the sun, the planets, and comets, could only proceed from the council and dominion of an Intelligent and powerful being\u2019.\n\nThe emergence of a concept of \u2018laws of nature\u2019 is visible most strongly in the 17 th century in the writings of Newton, Descartes and Boyle [\u00a01\u00a0] . The idea was introduced specifically \u201cto replace the Aristotelian concepts of substances and qualities, which up to that time had been used to explain the created order\u201d. [\u00a02\u00a0] By general consensus, the very idea of a \u2018law of nature\u2019 has deep theological roots. The idea was that just as there is a creator God who establishes moral laws for the universe, so there must be scientific laws that describe God\u2019s rational mathematical activity in His creation. And these laws can only be discovered empirically, they cannot be worked out from first principles as some of the Greek rationalists mistakenly thought.\n\nAs Descartes wrote to Mersenne, on April 15, 1630: \u201cGod established these laws in nature, in the same way as a king establishes laws in his kingdom.\u201d What is more, God put them in our souls, \u201cas a king would inscribe his laws on the hearts of all his subjects, if he were able to do it\u201d. In 1690 Boyle writes that \u201cThe laws of motion, without which the present state and course of things could not be maintained, did not necessarily spring from the nature of matter, but depended upon the will of the divine author of things\u201d. Therefore, we cannot second-guess God ahead of time to infer what those laws might be: we can only find out by making observations and doing experiments. Ren\u00e9 Descartes, writing in 1644, makes the point in these words:\n\nSince there are countless different configurations which God might have instituted here, experience alone must teach us which configurations he actually selected in preference to the rest. We are thus free to make any assumption on these matters with the sole proviso that all the consequences of our assumption must agree with experience [\u00a03\u00a0] .\n\nIf one believes in God as author of creation, the one whose will and purposes underlies and sustains all that exists, then it is a perfectly rational step towards believing that we live in a rational universe with properties that can be described using some very rational and elegant mathematics, as well as some very convincing laws. But science itself can never answer the question as to why an ordered universe exists \u2013 which is what makes science possible \u2013 it just inherits the assumptions and traditions established by the theological assumptions of past centuries and carries on regardless.\n\nThe secular dilemma is that historically it seems quite clear that the concept of laws of nature has deep roots in Christian theology, but this does not sit easily with the secular idea that scientific advance was accelerated by the overthrow of religion. The tension is highly visible in the writings of philosopher Nancy Cartwright [\u00a04\u00a0] . Cartwright is critical of the idea of universal scientific laws, maintaining that we live in a dappled world in which laws apply only in special circumstances and to a small domain of the empirical world. This stems at least partly from Cartwright\u2019s antipathy to theism and the necessity, as she sees it, for belief in a rational law-giving God to undergird the very notion of universal scientific laws [\u00a05\u00a0] .\n\nSo here we see the creeping influence of the kind of post-modernist philosophy that Biggar highlights. For in a dappled world in which order, as described by laws, is only found in special circumstances, then the progress of science itself becomes problematic, for it is in the study of order \u2013 including that expressed in quantum mechanics and in chaos theory \u2013 that scientific explanations become most fruitful.\n\nFor in science, viewing the reasons of others as \u201cmerely the disguises of unjust power\u201d, as in Michel Foucault, will lead to no new discoveries. For these depend on an empirical search for truth that in turn depends on the coherent and rational structure of the created order. Loss of belief in the creative rational divine mind who is immanent in all that exists (John 1:3; Colossians 1:15-17) can lead to a loss of faith in the order expressed in the world around us and, in turn, as in Cartwright, to a degrading of the very idea of laws of nature.

There is no substitute for it in a healthy church. Where there is life there is thinking, a weighing of opinions, talk, and debate. Where these are absent there is cause for concern.

This kind of discussion, however, becomes impossible when one or both parties take themselves too seriously, convinced that truth will live or die with them alone; or when there is an inability or unwillingness to admit that one might be wrong.

Narrow, unloving contentiousness is an objective and a tool of the devil. Nothing serves the \u201ckingdom of darkness\u201d better than a cantankerous churchman or theologian with a passion for debate. I believe that it was CS Lewis who suggested that hell, where noise and discord are perfect, is where such persons will feel most at home. Rather than helping the cause of truth and light, they impede its progress and so poison the atmosphere that fruitful discussion becomes impossible. It was the lack of magnanimity in leaders on both sides in the Arminian controversy that made it a bitter experience in both church and state.\n\nA second requirement for fruitful debate, likewise a scriptural virtue, is humility. This means recognition of one\u2019s frailty and the possibility that the other person might have a point of view worth considering, indeed, that they might even be right. Knowledge is limited; no finite presence has all truth. Augustine was thinking of that when he said that the first, second, and third rules of the Christian religion were one: humility. Quoting that quip with appreciation, Calvin extolled humility as the only approach to God, rid ourselves of \u201cthe disease of self-love and ambition\u201d, and get on with life. [\u00a01\u00a0]\n\nA third necessity for profitable discussion is honesty. There is no substitute for honesty in debate, particularly theological debate.\n\nIt is also necessary to try to understand others\u2019 points of view. What is it that moves them to take their positions? Calvin strove for such understanding in the eucharistic controversies of his time. There are reasons behind the positions taken, and their discovery may alter opinions. This is why it is difficult to condemn John Wesley\u2019s statements on sin and grace; in the light of the antinomianism of his day they make sense.\n\nA sense of proportion is invaluable in theological discussion. Trivial matters often become major concerns in the minds of some; slight deviation from a desirable norm is often seen as justification for splitting the church. Calvin had such \u201ccapricious separation\u201d in mind when he wrote on the church. [\u00a02\u00a0] It is well to keep in mind the slogan of medieval Schoolmen, Qui bene distinguit, bene docet (S/he who distinguishes well, teaches well).\n\nA final rule for the theological debate is that the parties stay within the bounds of Scripture in positions taken. Where there is speculation in discussion, as there is bound to be, that fact should be acknowledged. No speculative opinion, however, no \u201chuman invention\u201d is permitted \u201cto bind or compel the conscience\u201d in the Church reformed according to the Word of God.

[Perhaps the title should be \u2019Created Order and Moral Order\u2019?]\n\nNigel Biggar acknowledges the effects of sin by identifying the issue of moral failing - \u2019fallen human conscience\u2019 and people \u2019cannot be always relied upon to do what moral law obliges\u2019. This could arise from human wilfulness (according to St Paul), from weakness of the will (akrasia), or from ignorance. The last of these does not feature in his exposition, and yet is evidently an important issue. What is missing is what Emil Brunner termed \u2019the noetic effects of sin\u2019 [\u00a01\u00a0] - that is, our inability to understand human passions and behaviour on a purely naturalistic basis. According to Brunner (and Abram Kuyper and the Reformed tradition) without appealing to revelation we may not arrive at the truth where human nature is central to the phenomena we are seeking to understand , and that is particularly true of human ethics and responsibility. More generally the argument that Biggar advances is convincing on the existence of a moral order in our universe, but is not so convincing on how we come to comprehend it.\n\nIs there a disconnect between the kind of moral thinking that Biggar has in mind, and the Biblical (OT) emphasis on God\u2019s law revealed at Sinai? The Psalms focus on the latter, as for example in Psalm 119, and look to created order as evidence of God\u2019s power rather than as a source of moral instruction. As he notes, one NT passage that seems to appeal to natural law comes in the first two chapters of Romans [\u00a02\u00a0] . More generally, the preview is silent on Biblical ethics, and what we are to make of the biblical material in relation to moral order. See for example in my own area the excellent exposition by Barrera (Albino Barrera (2013), Biblical Economic Ethics, Lexington Books). Are Biblical ethics not relevant to Nigel\u2019s exposition? If so, it would be helpful to understand the case for discounting them.\n\nThere is a further concern about the \u2019applications\u2019 of moral law in a fallen world. The classic statement comes in Jesus\u2019 teaching about divorce, where he notes that the moral law requires marriage to be indissoluble, but Moses permitted divorce because of \u2019hardness of heart\u2019. This may be straying too far outside Nigel\u2019s focus in the Preview, but it is for example exactly the kind of moral wrestling that generated the traditions of casuistry.\n\nThe final section on \u2019the academic vocation\u2019 is very helpful in laying out the pitfalls of sinful human motivations in the academic task, and the virtues that are required to counter them. But it does not address the question of how we go about \u2019the discovery of the truth of reality as given by God\u2019. If the \u2019noetic effects of sin\u2019 as described by Brunner are present, then in the human sciences at least questions of methodology are going to be critically important.

Stoics believed that the rational divine principle, the Logos , generated and sustained the created order. They argued that one could derive moral principles from the examination of the created order, insofar as the created order reflects the divine will more accurately than human behavior tends to do (because humans are corrupted by their passions and thus behave in ways contrary to their own divinity-reflecting-rationality). Paul relies upon this sort of argumentation, but (true to his Jewish theological paradigm) connects it with his reading of the Old Testament, for example with the primeval history of Genesis (1 Cor 11:8-9; cf. 1 Tim 2:13-15), insofar as he surmised that the supposed historical veracity of the Genesis creation narratives would align with the created world as he observed it in his own era. He therefore weaves together natural law observations with invocations of the Genesis narrative, to ground his moral-theological injunctions.\n\nThe problem, however, is that Paul\u2019s observation of the supposed natural order is culturally embedded in sometimes suspect fashions (as when he claims that nature demonstrates that it is degrading for a man to have long hair, whereas it is proper for a woman to have long hair; 1 Cor 11:14-15). Additionally, contrary to Paul\u2019s assumption, there are good reasons to dispute the historicity of the Genesis narratives, which creates problems for the ethical teachings Paul develops on the basis of his reading of those narratives (i.e., his contention that women should wear veils while praying or prophesying, or that women should not teach men).\n\nTo take another example, Jesus himself makes moral arguments drawing on the created order in Luke 12:22-30. Pointing out that birds and plants do not prepare for the future, Jesus enjoins his disciples not to worry about securing their future sustenance, arguing that the same God that provides for the birds and the grass will provide for humans. The difficulty with this sort of argument is that humans do in point of fact starve to death (as do animals, come to that), and in that knowledge, modern Christians by and large do not feel compunctions about saving for retirement, for example.\n\nConsequently, I have questions about how to develop Christian moral teaching in ways that draw upon observation of the created order. The clearest New Testament examples of attempting this sort of argumentation do not fare especially well and have not always been taken seriously by the Church (often with good reason).

    "bodyText": "The virtues are salient for issues in every academic field and for all elements of the academic life. Often when we think of morality, we think first of rules or principles defining good action and codes of conduct for behavior. These require people capable of putting them into practice. Principles must be interpreted in order to be applied, and this requires good judgment. Virtue ethics helps us to think holistically about how groups, institutions such as universities, and practices form character and in turn are formed by the character of the people who constitute them. Most fundamentally, virtue ethics is about how we can be formed to flourish as persons in community, not least, in academia.\n\nThe virtues, such as courage, kindness, and practical wisdom, are stable dispositions that enable an agent to act and live well. An agent\u2019s virtues and vices together constitute their moral character. Christian virtues are formed within the context of the life of the Church and support a life of faithful discipleship lived out in Church and world. Without the virtues, a person might sometimes act well, but will be unable to do so consistently and rightly. Without virtues, no moral code, however perfect, can ensure that we act well. With the virtues, a person perceives, feels, judges, and responds well, in ways appropriate to the complexities of situations, including the worlds of scholarship.\n\nThere is no exhaustive list of the virtues. Wherever there is a distinct challenge to our ability to feel, judge, and respond well, we can identify a virtue that perfects our dispositions with respect to that particular challenge.\n\nChristian thinkers, building on pagan thinkers of antiquity, most notably Aristotle and Cicero, identified four major challenges and thus four corresponding cardinal virtues.\n\nChristian reflections on the virtues critiqued and transformed the pagan heritage. For instance, the crucified Jesus and his martyred followers, rather than heroic warriors, have been regarded as epitomes of courage. The difficult good to be pursued is not earthly glory but love and service of God and neighbor.\n\nChristian thinkers have also held that persons are in need of the theological virtues of faith, hope, and love in order to be able to act well in relationship to God, who transcends finite earthly goods, and in order to love enemies as well as friends (1 Cor. 13:13; Matt. 5:44).\n\nDifferent Christian thinkers developed distinctive emphases.

    "bodyText": "How can reflection on the virtues help to shape the life of Christian discipleship? And how can we embody the virtues as scholars and in the life of the university? In this essay, I explain how the virtues enable us to move beyond a narrow focus on dos and don\u2019ts; virtues form character and enable persons to flourish in community. I explore how Christian reflection on the virtues is rooted in the Bible while also being informed by ancient ethical reflection and able to connect fruitfully with other traditions. I discuss the processes by which virtues are acquired and developed, contrasting them with personality traits and skills. The task of differentiating the virtues from one another involves identifying the distinct challenges that confront us as we seek to live well; I unpack the four classical cardinal virtues along with the three theological virtues of faith, hope, and love, and discuss how Christian thinkers have understood the virtues in relationship to divine law. It is theologically important to understand how the virtues are gifts of divine grace and not a form of works righteousness; I also address how these commitments can go hand in hand with the affirmation of genuine virtues among non-Christians and the recognition of the imperfection of Christian virtues. The final sections of the essay address questions surrounding the virtues of institutions and the possibilities for cultivating the virtues in our scholarly lives, within our academic disciplines, and in the life of the university.\n\nOften when we think of morality, we think first of rules or principles defining good action, which together comprise a code of conduct for behavior. Rules and principles, however, require people capable of putting them into practice. Principles must be interpreted in order to be applied, and this requires good judgment. Virtue ethics helps us think not just about discrete dos and don\u2019ts, but in a much more holistic way, about how social groups, institutions and practices form personal character and in turn are shaped by the character of the people who constitute them. Most fundamentally, virtue ethics is about how we can be formed to flourish as persons in community, formed to find our own good in shared goods. [\u00a01\u00a0] Given this, it should come as no surprise that the virtues are salient for issues in every academic field and for all elements of the academic life.\n\nThe virtues, such as courage, kindness, and practical wisdom, are stable dispositions that enable an agent to respond and act well. An agent\u2019s virtues and vices together constitute their moral character. The virtues are perfective of actions and of the agent who performs those actions; they also thereby enable agents to contribute to the common good. The virtues of Christians are formed within the context of the life of the Church and support a life of faithful discipleship lived out in Church and world. Without the virtues, a person might sometimes act well, but will be unable to do so in a consistent way and for the right reasons. With the virtues, a person perceives, feels, desires, judges, and responds well, in ways appropriate to the complexities of situations. In the absence of the virtues, no moral code, however perfect, can ensure that we act well. The virtues are essential to living well as the embodied practical reasoners that we are, in right relationship with one another. They are therefore also essential to human flourishing in community.\n\nThe Bible makes clear that Christians are summoned to a life of virtue. Jesus in the Beatitudes declares blessed or happy those whose character is marked by the virtues of meekness, justice, mercy, purity, peacefulness, and fidelity (Matthew 5: 3\u201311). Matthew\u2019s gospel shows Jesus both as epitomizing these virtues in his own life and as empowering his followers to develop them. Paul associates love with a multitude of other virtues: patience, kindness, humility, forgivingness, as well as faith and hope (1 Corinthians 13: 4\u20137; 13). 1 Peter, meanwhile, speaks of a purification of the soul that issues in \u201cgenuine mutual affection,\u201d reminding Christians that they are called to \u201cbe holy, for I [God] am holy\u201d (1 Peter 1: 22; 16). 2 Peter calls Christians to \u201cmake every effort to support your faith with excellence, and excellence with knowledge, and knowledge with self-control, and self-control with endurance, and endurance with godliness, and godliness with mutual affection, and mutual affection with love\u201d (2 Peter 1: 5\u20137). While developing these virtues requires effort on the part of believers, they are also assured that God\u2019s \u201cdivine power has given us everything needed for life and godliness\u201d so that they may become \u201cparticipants of the divine nature\u201d (2 Peter 1: 3\u20134). In Galatians 5, the virtues are described as \u201cthe fruit of the Spirit,\u201d and enumerated as \u201clove, joy, peace, patience, kindness, generosity, faithfulness, gentleness, and self-control\u201d (5:22\u201323). The virtues are thus held up as forms of Christlikeness and godliness, transformations of character that involve human striving but that are at the same time gifts of grace.\n\nWhile the Hebrew Bible is typically associated with divine commandments and thus with a legal morality, New Testament understandings of the virtues as forms of godliness are rooted in characterizations in the Hebrew Bible of God\u2019s faithfulness, mercy, compassion, and lovingkindness, that is, of God\u2019s virtues. The God of the Covenant is characterized above all by hesed , translated variously as \u201clove and faithfulness,\u201d \u201cunfailing love,\u201d \u201cfaithful love,\u201d \u201csteadfast love,\u201d and \u201cloyal love.\u201d To be called to be holy as God is holy is thus to be called to develop this virtue of faithful love. Christians encounter this love most fully in Jesus.\n\nThat Christians understand the virtues to be grace-enabled does not mean that the presence of the virtues among non-Christians need be denied. As we shall discuss in a later section, the doctrine of common grace can help to make sense of the fact that neither reflection on the virtues nor the virtues themselves are exclusive to Christians. Explicit Christian reflection on the virtues, while rooted in the Bible, also drew extensively on the philosophical thought of ancient Greece and Rome. Ancient schools of thought varied, but all agreed that ethical reflection begins with asking, how ought I to live? with the virtues forming a critical part of the answer. [\u00a02\u00a0] Greek and Roman virtue ethical traditions were absorbed into Christianity while also being transformed in decisive ways. This origin story does not mean, however, that virtue ethics is a characteristic solely of the West. All human communities identify virtuous and vicious character traits, and virtue ethics is a default form of commonsense ethical reflection across cultures and eras, albeit more highly theorized in some contexts than in others. Confucian thinkers offer highly refined discussions og the virtues that enable persons to live an admirable life. [\u00a03\u00a0] Even ethical traditions heavily focused on law, such as we find in the Hebrew Bible, Rabbinic Judaism, and certain strands of Christianity, unite this with robust concern for the virtues and their cultivation. Proper obedience to the law requires stable dispositions, ranging from wise discernment to love of the law, which can be identified as virtues.\n\nThe virtues are not inborn, but neither can they simply be taught. Virtues are like skills in that neither is innate, and both are acquired through a kind of learning by doing that is not a mere matter of copying or repetition but requires understanding and a capacity for improvisation in the context of new situations. Emulation of a virtuous exemplar is never simply a matter of rote imitation but involves a deepening grasp, affective as well as cognitive, of what is worth doing and being and why. From infancy, we come equipped with certain capacities and preferences, for empathy and compassion, for kindness and fairness. [\u00a04\u00a0] These provide raw materials for the development of the virtues. In early childhood, the family provides the most significant site for ethical formation, as children learn both through direct instruction and example what counts as \u201ckind,\u201d \u201cbrave,\u201d \u201cgenerous,\u201d \u201cfair,\u201d \u201ctruthful,\u201d and so on. But it does not suffice that a child learns the meanings of these virtue concepts, nor simply learns that acting in these ways elicits affirmation and approval from parents and others. Children must come to aspire for the approval of those whose goodness they admire, not merely for the approval of those who have power in their lives. [\u00a05\u00a0] And ultimately, their commitment to the good must become independent of such approval. Children must grasp for themselves that being kind, brave, fair, and truthful is good and desirable for its own sake, and desire to become this kind of person. This is possible because moral education harnesses given preferences and motivations, engaging the child in an ongoing process of reflection that shapes and refines existing desires, emotions, and judgments. We love and admire those we experience to be caring and generous, and we desire to become like those we admire. [\u00a06\u00a0] We imaginatively adopt the ways our exemplars perceive and respond to the world. A child longs to emulate young Jesus, teaching in the temple, or the boy who offered up his loaves and fishes. And even young children are engaged in a complex process of working through tensions amongst the various things and people they find good and admirable, guided by trusted adults who provide reasons that point out salient features of circumstances and motivations. Jalen knows that it is unfair if Tala is given a cookie and he is not. But is it unfair if Tala and Jalen were told that each would receive a cookie if they helped mix the cookies, and only Tala was given a cookie because only Tala helped? Reflection on such ordinary situations, and on the feelings and responses we have in such contexts, enables the development of practical reasoning.\n\nThe development of the virtues is not completed within childhood but extends across the lifespan, insofar as acting well further strengthens our virtues while acting poorly undermines them. While Aristotle was pessimistic about the possibility of developing the virtues in adulthood, Christians have always affirmed the possibility of transformations of heart and character at any age. Today, psychological research is confirming the possibility of ongoing characterological change. [\u00a07\u00a0] As we mature, we encounter new circumstances; a steady disposition to generosity within the family may not neatly translate into generosity outside the home; courage on the soccer field into courage in the face of chronic illness, and so forth. Both Martha and Mary are exemplars, but how are we to emulate both? Integrity across domains becomes a new challenge. [\u00a08\u00a0] Both our commitment to the good and our discernment of how to act well in the context of varied circumstances are at stake.\n\nPersonal relationships, communities and institutions all play a critical role in enabling persons to develop and sustain the virtues. Virtues are cultivated in the context of communities that lift up exemplars, pass down inspiring narratives of life lived well amidst circumstances both supportive and challenging, and offer both bracing truth-telling and a sense of belonging within which it becomes possible to face up to our own deep flaws and reaffirm our commitment to develop finer-grained moral discernment and more whole-hearted devotion to the good. All of these important features are present within communities of faith. Biblical exemplars are often deeply flawed, enabling us to identify our own flawed selves with them while renewing our ethical and spiritual aspiration. Think of Peter, eager to show his faithfulness to Jesus, who nevertheless in fear denies his connection to him, or the disciples unable to stay awake in the Garden of Gethsemane. Communities of faith invite persons to orient their lives to God, opening themselves to the grace-filled transformation of all finite concerns and commitments, now known and loved in relation to their divine source and ground.\n\nWhen all goes well in this process, desires and emotions harmonize with increasingly refined judgments, in a process that goes on as long as a person continues to encounter new situations and circumstances. [\u00a09\u00a0] As one acquires the virtues, one develops an ever-richer grasp of what is worth doing and being and works toward a fuller integration of all of one\u2019s loves and commitments. This often involves coming to see the limitations of those who have served as one\u2019s exemplars, and a finer-grained grasp of their virtues and vices. We learn to emulate in more discerning ways. We come to be critically appreciative of our communities and of the ways in which they have deformed as well as formed us. Dispositions that enable us to act well in strictly limited circumstances\u2014on the playing field, or within the congregation\u2014grow in ways that enable fine-grained perception and response in a wide array of circumstances. For many of us, though, the virtues do not develop in such a smooth fashion. We may take pleasure not in acting well, but in self-indulgences that harm and deprive others, failing to attend to the viciousness of our patterns of behaving. Or we may have a commitment to standing up for the oppressed but fail time and time again, fearful of losing the favor of powerful others. Or we may succeed in surface generosity while experiencing giving as difficult and unpleasant. These are three distinct ways of falling short of acting virtuously: self-indulgence, weakness of will, and continence. The self-indulgent person follows pleasure, acting well only by accident, when doing the kind, generous, courageous thing just happens to be pleasant. The weak-willed want to act well but experience other, conflicting desires that carry the day. And the continent person succeeds in acting well, but finds it a struggle to do so. To be virtuous, in contrast, involves not only consistently acting well but having a character such that one finds it pleasant to act fairly, courageously, and generously and is no longer capable of taking pleasure or satisfaction in acting any other way.\n\nHuman beings have both temperamental and acquired dispositions that do not count as virtues.\n\nTemperamental dispositions are personality traits like being extroverted, anxious, or talkative. We also have acquired dispositions that arise out of experience, as when a person becomes withdrawn as a result of trauma or abuse. An influential psychological theory introduced in the 1980s identifies the \u201cBig Five\u201d personality traits as openness, conscientiousness, extraversion, agreeableness, and neuroticism. [\u00a010\u00a0] Temperament is generally regarded as biologically based and permanent. Even Aristotle spoke of \u201cnatural virtues,\u201d noting that each person seems to have a certain type of character from birth. [\u00a011\u00a0] These do not count as virtues in the proper sense because a virtue enables its possessor to respond appropriately to a wide range of differing circumstances, and this flexibility of response requires knowledge and understanding of what one is doing and why; the virtuous agent, argues Aristotle, not only acts out of a stable disposition, but also deliberately and voluntarily chooses the act, and chooses it for its own sake. [\u00a012\u00a0]\n\nWhile character virtues are similar to skills, they importantly differ in that a skill can be used to either good or bad ends. Grit, or persistence in the face of difficulty, has been hailed as key to success in a wide range of endeavors from school to business and the arts. [\u00a013\u00a0] Grit is a skill, however, not a virtue; a gritty criminal is able to inflict much more harm than a lazy or distractible criminal. In order to count as the virtue of perseverance, perfective of its possessor, the skill involved in grit must be holistically good and directed to good ends.\n\nOne traditional division among the virtues, reaching back to Aristotle, is that between the intellectual virtues and the moral virtues.\u00a0 A person can possess intellectual virtues, dispositions that perfect their capacities for the attainment of knowledge, independently of possessing the moral virtues, which make a person\u2019s actions and character good.\u00a0 Absent the moral virtues, one can make bad use of an intellectual virtue, as a person\u2019s capacities for the pursuit of knowledge can be put to bad ends.\u00a0 The intellectual virtues are thus virtues only in a qualified sense, since perfecting the intellect alone does not ensure that we desire and will what is good.\u00a0 Intellectual virtue is thus better characterized as skill.\n\nSome thinkers are willing to consider traits such as good memory and excellent perception as intellectual virtues. These, however, are best thought of as natural traits rather than virtues. Better candidates for intellectual virtues properly speaking, as dispositional traits subject to cultivation, would be skills in abstraction, inference, imagination, and synthesis. It is possible to be a brilliant scientist, possessing a host of intellectual virtues or skills, while lacking the moral virtues that make one a good person. On the other hand, excellent scientists often have a host of moral virtues as well, including patience, humility, courage, and honesty, which enable them to make good use of their intellectual skills, directing them to good ends, and perfecting their actions and character.\n\nThe observation that the wicked prosper is age-old. To understand the virtues is to grasp that the wicked, even if they gain power or wealth, cannot possibly prosper in an ultimate sense; the virtues are essential to human flourishing. It is certainly not the case that things always go well for virtuous people; circumstances can be recalcitrant and dramatically impede flourishing, as witnessed by the righteous indignation of Jesus in the temple and his agony on the cross. However, the virtues heal our inner conflicts. They transform our affections so that we enjoy acting well, taking pleasure in what is good. They equip us to resist injustice and to work for institutions that support human flourishing in community. The virtues thus never detract from happiness; they enable a person to flourish as fully as is possible amidst whatever conditions that person confronts. [\u00a014\u00a0] To have the virtues is to be equipped to live well, come what may.\n\nActing virtuously is functioning well as a human person, with desires, emotions, judgments, and projects harmonizing with one another. It is thus intrinsically pleasant. While those who are self-indulgent or weak-willed take pleasure in pursuing desires that are unhinged from a person\u2019s judgments concerning what is good and worth seeking, the virtuous can find no pleasure in acting viciously. While virtuous action is inherently pleasant, the virtuous person does not act well instrumentally, with a view to experiencing this pleasure. Nor is the virtuous person\u2019s ultimate reason for acting her own perfection. This would be objectionably egocentric. Rather, to be virtuous is to act as one does because one cares for their own sake about the goods at stake in particular situations\u2014because this person is hurting and in need of comfort, say, or because the truth must be told despite powerful interests in concealment. The virtuous person seeks to act well because acting well is good , not merely because it is good for me . [\u00a015\u00a0]\n\nChristians grasp this pursuit of the good as a pursuit of God. We come to know and love God ever more fully as we develop the virtues, for in and through the virtues we come to grasp and align our agency with the various finite goods that are grounded in God\u2019s perfect goodness. In Jesus we encounter this perfected agency in alignment with the good.\n\nGiven that the virtuous person\u2019s motivation and reasons for acting flow from the good as such, rather than from the agent\u2019s particular good, the virtues are no more oriented to personal than to social flourishing. To have the virtues is to be disposed to act well in relation to other individuals and to one\u2019s various communities. It is to seek their flourishing as one seeks one\u2019s own flourishing, as intrinsically good. The virtuous person will not cultivate habits of lying, cheating, or stealing in order to promote the social welfare, but this is not because she values her own character above the common good. Rather, it is because welfare achieved by such means is not genuine social flourishing.\n\nThere is no exhaustive list of the virtues. Wherever there is a distinct challenge to our ability to feel, judge, and respond well, we can identify a virtue that perfects our dispositions with respect to that particular difficulty. We need the virtue of honesty because it is tempting to use falsehoods to protect ourselves and our projects; perseverance because we are inclined to give up when the going gets tough. If we consider the virtues as perfecting character with respect to challenges to acting well that arise from our physical and social environments, it is evident that people face distinct obstacles in different times and places, and hence that they need different virtues. Constancy, for instance, has been identified as a distinctively modern virtue required for navigating the fragmented social spheres of contemporary life. [\u00a016\u00a0] On the other hand, if we consider the virtues with reference to how they perfect dimensions of human agency itself, responding to challenges that arise from within, we arrive at virtues of perennial significance, vital to living well in any circumstances. What does it mean to say that Christ was perfectly virtuous? This does not mean that there is a definitive, all-encompassing list of virtues, and that he had all of these. Rather, the claim is that his character was such that he responded perfectly, in his desires, perceptions, emotions, deliberations, decisions, and actions, in all the situations he encountered.\n\nChristian thinkers, building on pagan thinkers of antiquity, most notably Aristotle and Cicero, have long identified four major challenges to acting well arising out of the character of human agency (our passions, will, and practical intellect) and thus four corresponding major virtues, which are known as the cardinal virtues. Other virtues have typically been subsumed under these four.\n\nIndebted as Christian reflection on the virtues has been to pagan antiquity, it has also critiqued and transformed that heritage. For instance, the crucified Jesus and his martyred followers, rather than heroic warriors, have been regarded as foremost epitomes of courage. [\u00a017\u00a0] The difficult good to be pursued is not earthly glory but love and service of God and neighbor. The vulnerable and powerless are not to be despised and exploited, but embraced and upheld. Christian thinkers have also held that persons are in need of the theological virtues of faith, hope, and love in order to be able to act well in relationship to God, who transcends finite earthly goods, and in order to love enemies as well as friends (1 Cor. 13:13; Matt. 5:44).\n\nDifferent Christian thinkers and traditions have developed distinctive emphases in their accounts of the virtues. Augustine, influenced by the ancient Stoic view of the unity of virtue, regarded all of the cardinal virtues as expressions of the love of God and neighbor commanded by Jesus as the summary of the law (Matt. 22:37). Aquinas, who was more concerned to develop a systematic account of the virtues that integrated insights from Aristotle\u2019s ethics, developed an intricate account of the cardinal and theological virtues, including a host of subordinate virtues, all infused by grace and nourished by the life of faith. Lutheran and Reformed thinkers, underscoring the fallenness of human will and reason and the centrality of scripture as God\u2019s revealed law, picked up and further developed Scholastic treatments of the various virtues as correlated with and amplifying the moral skeleton provided by the Ten Commandments (Ex. 20:1-17). For all of these thinkers, divine law and the virtues go hand in hand.\n\nNo single virtue can be perfected in the absence of the others. This may seem implausible at first glance. It seems commonsensical to affirm that a person may be courageous but impatient, or scrupulously fair but stingy. Yet as soon as we think about what is involved in possessing a virtue, we see how each is connected with many others. Possession of the virtue of generosity, for instance, is not simply a matter of spontaneous giving. A person\u2019s generosity is flawed if she gives away what belongs to another, or gives someone something that will harm or offend them. Perfected generosity thus requires good judgment, that is, practical wisdom. It also requires justice, even courage. Given the interconnectedness of the virtues, it is only possible to possess a virtue in its full, perfected, form if one possesses all of the other virtues as well. The upshot here may be easier for Christians than for others to acknowledge, given the Christian confession that Jesus Christ is the only perfect human person. This leaves ample room for recognizing imperfect virtues in ourselves and others, and for recognizing that each of us typically possesses certain virtues more fully than others. Indeed, just as Paul speaks of spiritual gifts that are variously distributed among individuals for the upbuilding of the Body of Christ, so we can rejoice that some of us excel in the virtue of kindness, being exquisitely sensitive to the needs of those around us, while others are noteworthy for their courage, their willingness to speak out in the face of injustices on behalf of the marginalized and downtrodden.\n\nActing together, the virtues heal persons of inner conflict of desire against desire and desire against judgment, equipping a person to discern and seek good ends and to deliberate well concerning good and appropriate means to these ends.\n\nWe have explored how the virtues are acquired through a complex process in which a person admires virtuous exemplars, desires to be like them, discerns the distinctive forms of goodness they embody, imagines an ideal self that is relevantly like them, and seeks to act accordingly, critically examining their failures and successes along the way. For Christians, this process is shaped in fundamental ways by life in the church. [\u00a018\u00a0] Exemplars are encountered in scripture and worship and potluck dinners and church ministries. Jesus Christ, as perfectly human, fully exemplifies the virtues. The saints, too, serve as spiritual and moral exemplars, with their depiction in stained glass windows, altars, and sculptures serving to inspire the faithful. Scriptural narratives display virtues (and sometimes vices) in rich detail; the virtue of courage comes to life in the story of Esther; the vice of greed in the parable of the rich fool.\n\nChristian thinkers from Augustine through Thomas Aquinas and Jonathan Edwards have also insisted that the virtues are a gift of divine grace, building on Paul\u2019s talk of God\u2019s love being poured into believers\u2019 hearts by the Holy Spirit (Rom. 5:5), and therefore speaking in terms of the infusion of moral and theological virtues through the sacraments. While some thinkers have held that only the theological virtues are infused, while the moral virtues are acquired, others have insisted that Christians receive infused moral virtues, too, in order to be effectively oriented to God as final end and equipped for the new life of faith. Scholastic thinkers also identified a distinctive role for the scriptural gifts of the Holy Spirit (Isaiah 11:2\u20133), disposing persons to be moved directly by the Holy Spirit. [\u00a019\u00a0]\n\nGrasping the character of virtues as gifts heals our sinful tendency to regard them as a means of earning salvation. The virtues are not another form of works-righteousness, and fallen human beings lack the capacity to acquire the virtues through their own autonomous effort. This does not mean, however, that Christians need not be fully involved in the process of cultivating these grace-given virtues. Divine and human agency do not exclude or compete with one another when it comes to growth in the virtues. [\u00a020\u00a0] Spiritual disciplines such as repentance, self-examination, and prayer join with common practices of admiration, emulation, and aspiration in cultivating virtue. [\u00a021\u00a0] Grace orients human beings to the God whose transcendent goodness is beyond our grasp, and heals sinful tendencies that distort our desires and commitments and lead us to privilege ourselves and our in-groups.\n\nIf the virtues are grace-given, does this mean that Christians deny the possession of virtues by non-Christians? Early and medieval Christians wrestled with this question in the form of the possibility of pagan virtue. Augustine famously considered the virtues of pagan Rome to be in reality splendid vices, corrupted at their heart by pride. Whereas the pagan pursuit of virtue was a pursuit of glory and honor for the self, Christian virtues were grounded in humble acceptance of grace and oriented to God, not self. But even Augustine held that Christians could learn a great deal by studying and emulating certain pagan heroes. Medieval scholastic thinkers, meanwhile, argued that pagans possessed genuine, if imperfect, civic or acquired virtues. They noted that pagan thinkers were capable of recognizing that self-giving service to the common good was distinct from, and corrupted by, the pursuit of glory for oneself. The end of living well in earthly community was not a false end but one that, rightly understood, could be related harmoniously with the ultimate end of glorifying God. [\u00a022\u00a0] Pagan virtue could thus be seen as oriented to a good proximate or penultimate end, even if not (or not consciously) to God as ultimate end.\n\nWe can affirm, further, that it is not solely through the sacraments or the life of Christian faith that grace is given or virtue infused. Our very being is divine gift, and there are no limits on the workings of divine grace. Many Christians, particularly within Reformed Christian traditions, affirm a doctrine of common grace, through which God bestows providential blessings on all humankind. In some sense, then, we can appropriately affirm all virtues, whether those of Christians or of non-Christians, as both acquired and infused, grace-given and developed through human agency. It is of course true at the same time that grasping one\u2019s being, agency, and virtues as grace-given is profoundly transformative. It is therefore appropriate to speak of an added special gift/grace that transforms our perception of and relation to all other goods when we understand ourselves as creatures invited into friendship with God.\n\nIf the virtues of non-Christians remain imperfect in not being exercised for the sake of friendship with God, the virtues of Christians, too, remain imperfect in a host of ways. Augustine emphasized that virtue remains a struggle for Christians in this life, echoing Paul in Galatians 5:17. Aquinas argued that the infused virtues suffice to direct Christians toward their ultimate end in God, but they often coexist with contrary acquired dispositions. Hence, the infused virtues do not, at least initially, enable Christians to act well easily and with pleasure. Reformation thinkers underscored the radical character of human sinfulness, stressing that sinful inclinations remain active in the faithful. There is no tidy contrast to be drawn between the virtuousness of Christians and the viciousness of non-Christians. Christians affirm the perfect virtue of Jesus Christ, but by that same token do not look for this perfection in mere human beings.\n\nVirtues are dispositions of individual persons, stable tendencies to feel, perceive, respond, judge, and act in good ways. Can we also speak of the virtues of institutions? Social practices, institutions, and communities can be conducive, or not, to developing and sustaining the virtues. We have already seen this in the case of the church and its varied practices. In this sense, we can speak analogously of virtuous institutions when their organizing principles and daily practices are such as to support the virtues of those who inhabit them. Take as an example the volunteer mountain rescue services that operate in regions around the world. Teams of world-class climbers and guides volunteer their time, training and carrying out complicated rescue operations, often saving hapless hikers who have failed to follow basic safety precautions. These organizations model courage, discipline, dedication, and compassion. To participate in an organization of this kind is to refine one\u2019s grasp of these virtues, of the goods they secure, and of their intrinsic value. This is not to say that every person who participates in such an organization will develop its associated virtues. Brash daredevils, too, might be attracted into mountain rescue activities, and might fail to develop their associated virtues. To the extent that they fail to do so, they fail to become good rescuers.\n\nWhile we can easily think of institutions that support the cultivation of virtues, it is also not difficult to identify institutions that cultivate vices as well as or instead of virtues. While participation in team sports can cultivate persistence, cooperation, and loyalty, becoming part of the institution of professional sports can have a corrupting effect on character, as the pursuit of money and fame swamp the goods intrinsic to athletic competition. This is not to say that money or fame are evil; money is a social institution that supports the exchange of goods and services, and fame or honor is bound up with the social recognition of excellence and thus with the cultivation of the virtues. The pursuit of money and fame as ends in themselves, however, has a corrupting effect on character. It is possible to maintain the virtues associated with athletics while participating in professional sports, but it is not easy.\n\nNuanced analyses of different social institutions, from families, schools, and neighborhood associations to advocacy groups, social media, markets, the law, and political institutions, can yield a finely differentiated understanding of the ways in which each, in particular times and places, supports or undermines the development of specific virtues and vices.\n\nIn reflecting on the virtues associated with academic life as a practice, we might think first and foremost of the intellectual virtues as those most directly fostered by the academy and by the scholarly life. As we have seen, however, intellectual virtues are not good in an unqualified sense, since perfection of the intellect, of our capacities for learning and knowledge, need not go hand-in-hand with perfection of the will and affections, of one\u2019s commitment to the good. Universities gather together many individuals who possess natural traits that suit them to the life of the mind: sharp memory, keen analytic skills, capacities for abstraction, for synthesis. Universities are, moreover, a site for the cultivation of such capacities into intellectual virtues, developed skills of the intellect. Whether or not these intellectual virtues will be joined together with character virtues is an open question.\n\nThere certainly are character virtues that are particularly important to the life of the mind. One of these is intellectual humility, which is characterized by an appropriate degree of confidence in one\u2019s beliefs and judgments and an appropriate openness to arguments and evidence that might undermine these commitments. [\u00a023\u00a0] Another is perseverance, the virtue that facilitates sustained effort over the long haul in the face of setbacks and challenges. Fairness is needed, in order to treat students appropriately, avoiding playing favorites. So is kindness, as students and colleagues alike encounter difficulty and discouragement. The more we reflect, the more we are forced to recognize that the scholarly life cannot flourish in a holistic way without the full panoply of the virtues.\n\nIn order to think well about the virtues that can be fostered within academic life as a practice, and by the university as a social institution, it is equally important to be attentive to the particular vices that are often cultivated in these contexts. Universities, like other social organizations, seek to create incentive structures that will elicit greater levels of effort and thus higher levels of performance. However, these incentives do not simply elicit effort; they also shape character, often in pernicious ways. Individuals who are initially drawn into the academy by their love of the pursuit of truth or their desire to contribute to productively addressing some social crisis or challenge, may come to care more about the recognition they receive for their discoveries than for the discoveries themselves or for the good accomplished in and through them. They may come to measure their value by the size of their compensation packages. They may be tempted to cut corners with their research to accelerate publication or pad their cvs in order to make a stronger impression on others. Faculty members may neglect their teaching or their responsibilities to students, since these receive comparatively little institutional attention or recognition. Each of us likely able to recall some brilliant but callous colleague, unwilling to invest in the common life of a department and skilled at triggering paralyzing self-doubt in others.\n\nUniversities can work to develop policies that weave fairness, transparency, and care into the daily life of the institution so that it is less vulnerable to individual faults and foibles. They can support rather than undermine the cultivation of character virtues as well as intellectual virtues by avoiding policies that create perverse incentive structures. For instance, universities can offer public recognition not merely of those achievements that bring in the most research dollars and that contribute most to the university\u2019s reputation and ranking, but also those habits and dispositions that contribute to the holistic flourishing of the university as a human community\u2014devoted teaching, patient mentoring, fair and efficient administration, and so forth. They can avoid using money as the primary measure of achievement and contribution, while ensuring no employee is exploited or treated in ways incommensurate with their dignity as human beings.\n\nAttention to incentive structures must go hand in hand with policies that foster a strong sense of community and belonging. The virtues thrive in contexts in which persons feel affirmed and supported as well as challenged to become their best selves for the sake of a common mission. There is a place for healthy competition, which can elicit striving towards shared goals, but only within a broader context in which individuals feel safe enough to risk failure because they know that their ultimate value does not ride on winning a competition.\n\nOf course, university administrators are often under pressure to rise in the research rankings, as this is a critical pathway to securing the funds that sustain the research enterprise and attract top faculty and students. Yet university mission statements typically articulate a commitment to the promotion of intrinsic rather than merely instrumental goods. My own university\u2019s statement is representative: \u201cYale is committed to improving the world today and for future generations through outstanding research and scholarship, education, preservation, and practice.\u201d [\u00a024\u00a0] The culture of the university ought itself to be aligned with these goals. Just as a commitment to cutting-edge research on carbon containment rings hollow when carried out on a campus that makes no effort at carbon containment, so the lofty commitment to improving the world ought similarly to begin at home, with the alignment on all fronts of the inner workings of our institutions with the ultimate ends they seek. We can begin to improve the world by fostering the virtues, without which holistic flourishing is impossible. By attending to the virtues and vices that are fostered by university life, by its institutional structures, policies, and cultures, and by working to transform these for the better, we can contribute to greater individual and social flourishing.\n\nAs scholars, we can be attentive not just to the characterological dimensions of the scholarly life as such, and to the university as an institution that is formative of character, but also to how our respective disciplines and individual scholarly agendas might help to contribute to the creation of communities of genuine human flourishing by contributing to building the character of the persons that constitute these communities. Laws, for instance, do not simply prescribe and prohibit actions, but also play a role in shaping the character of citizens. How might legal scholarship attend more fully to this feature of the law? [\u00a025\u00a0] Public policy can be designed in ways that respect and foster practical wisdom, rather than merely manipulating citizens as objects of social engineering. Search engine algorithms can be built in ways that foster awareness of complexity and ambiguity and therefore encourage conscious reflection rather than reinforcing stereotypes. [\u00a026\u00a0] The arts can powerfully shape perception and affective responsiveness to goods at stake in complex circumstances, fostering compassion and courage. Engineering can be oriented to flourishing in equitable community, guided by the virtue of justice. Business leaders and regulators can acknowledge that profit is not an ultimate human good and can work towards a more humane economy, one that serves genuine human needs and a more just and sustainable world for all creatures. [\u00a027\u00a0]\n\nConsideration of how our activities shape character should also extend to all dimensions of the academic life, ranging from our participation in scholarly societies, our involvement in scholarly publishing, grant-getting and grant-making activities, our social media presence, public scholarship, and all of the diverse ways in which our lives as academics are lived out beyond as well as within the walls of the university. In every dimension of our lives, our actions are expressive of our character and work in ways that contribute to the formation of others\u2019 character.\n\nThe virtues assist us in developing lives worth living and communities worth inhabiting. Christians can unite with those of other faiths and of no faith to attend to the ways in which our academic agendas, practices and institutions, form and de-form character and to how they can be remade in the service of holistic flourishing. Christians can grasp how the virtues that we cultivate are God\u2019s generous gift poured into our lives, and seek to live in ever-deeper awareness of the divine Goodness that grounds our being, inviting us to partake of the joy of the divine life.\n\nAdams, Robert M.

Rules and principles, however, require people capable of putting them into practice. Principles must be interpreted in order to be applied, and this requires good judgment. Virtue ethics helps us think not just about discrete dos and don\u2019ts, but in a much more holistic way, about how social groups, institutions and practices form personal character and in turn are shaped by the character of the people who constitute them. Most fundamentally, virtue ethics is about how we can be formed to flourish as persons in community, formed to find our own good in shared goods.<a class=\"anchor\" id=\"content100note1anc\" name=\"content100note1anc\">\u00a0</a><a class=\"note\" href=\"#content100note1sym\">[\u00a01\u00a0]</a> Given this, it should come as no surprise that the virtues are salient for issues in every academic field and for all elements of the academic life.</p>\n<p>The virtues, such as courage, kindness, and practical wisdom, are stable dispositions that enable an agent to respond and act well. An agent\u2019s virtues and vices together constitute their moral character. The virtues are perfective of actions and of the agent who performs those actions; they also thereby enable agents to contribute to the common good. The virtues of Christians are formed within the context of the life of the Church and support a life of faithful discipleship lived out in Church and world. Without the virtues, a person might sometimes act well, but will be unable to do so in a consistent way and for the right reasons. With the virtues, a person perceives, feels, desires, judges, and responds well, in ways appropriate to the complexities of situations. In the absence of the virtues, no moral code, however perfect, can ensure that we act well. The virtues are essential to living well as the embodied practical reasoners that we are, in right relationship with one another. They are therefore also essential to human flourishing in community.</p>\n<h2>Biblical Virtues\u00a0</h2>\n<p>The Bible makes clear that Christians are summoned to a life of virtue. Jesus in the Beatitudes declares blessed or happy those whose character is marked by the virtues of meekness, justice, mercy, purity, peacefulness, and fidelity (Matthew 5: 3\u201311). Matthew\u2019s gospel shows Jesus both as epitomizing these virtues in his own life and as empowering his followers to develop them. Paul associates love with a multitude of other virtues: patience, kindness, humility, forgivingness, as well as faith and hope (1 Corinthians 13: 4\u20137; 13). 1 Peter, meanwhile, speaks of a purification of the soul that issues in \u201cgenuine mutual affection,\u201d reminding Christians that they are called to \u201cbe holy, for I [God] am holy\u201d (1 Peter 1: 22; 16). 2 Peter calls Christians to \u201cmake every effort to support your faith with excellence, and excellence with knowledge, and knowledge with self-control, and self-control with endurance, and endurance with godliness, and godliness with mutual affection, and mutual affection with love\u201d (2 Peter 1: 5\u20137). While developing these virtues requires effort on the part of believers, they are also assured that God\u2019s \u201cdivine power has given us everything needed for life and godliness\u201d so that they may become \u201cparticipants of the divine nature\u201d (2 Peter 1: 3\u20134). In Galatians 5, the virtues are described as \u201cthe fruit of the Spirit,\u201d and enumerated as \u201clove, joy, peace, patience, kindness, generosity, faithfulness, gentleness, and self-control\u201d (5:22\u201323). The virtues are thus held up as forms of Christlikeness and godliness, transformations of character that involve human striving but that are at the same time gifts of grace.</p>\n<p>While the Hebrew Bible is typically associated with divine commandments and thus with a legal morality, New Testament understandings of the virtues as forms of godliness are rooted in characterizations in the Hebrew Bible of God\u2019s faithfulness, mercy, compassion, and lovingkindness, that is, of God\u2019s virtues. The God of the Covenant is characterized above all by <em>hesed</em>, translated variously as \u201clove and faithfulness,\u201d \u201cunfailing love,\u201d \u201cfaithful love,\u201d \u201csteadfast love,\u201d and \u201cloyal love.\u201d To be called to be holy as God is holy is thus to be called to develop this virtue of faithful love. Christians encounter this love most fully in Jesus.</p>\n<h2>The Virtues as Default Commonsense Ethical Reflection\u00a0</h2>\n<p>That Christians understand the virtues to be grace-enabled does not mean that the presence of the virtues among non-Christians need be denied. As we shall discuss in a later section, the doctrine of common grace can help to make sense of the fact that neither reflection on the virtues nor the virtues themselves are exclusive to Christians. Explicit Christian reflection on the virtues, while rooted in the Bible, also drew extensively on the philosophical thought of ancient Greece and Rome. Ancient schools of thought varied, but all agreed that ethical reflection begins with asking, how ought I to live? with the virtues forming a critical part of the answer.<a class=\"anchor\" id=\"content100note2anc\" name=\"content100note2anc\">\u00a0</a><a class=\"note\" href=\"#content100note2sym\">[\u00a02\u00a0]</a> Greek and Roman virtue ethical traditions were absorbed into Christianity while also being transformed in decisive ways. This origin story does not mean, however, that virtue ethics is a characteristic solely of the West. All human communities identify virtuous and vicious character traits, and virtue ethics is a default form of commonsense ethical reflection across cultures and eras, albeit more highly theorized in some contexts than in others. Confucian thinkers offer highly refined discussions og the virtues that enable persons to live an admirable life.<a class=\"anchor\" id=\"content100note3anc\" name=\"content100note3anc\">\u00a0</a><a class=\"note\" href=\"#content100note3sym\">[\u00a03\u00a0]</a> Even ethical traditions heavily focused on law, such as we find in the Hebrew Bible, Rabbinic Judaism, and certain strands of Christianity, unite this with robust concern for the virtues and their cultivation. Proper obedience to the law requires stable dispositions, ranging from wise discernment to love of the law, which can be identified as virtues.</p>\n<h2>How are the Virtues Acquired?\u00a0</h2>\n<h3>We Admire and Seek to Emulate:\u00a0</h3>\n<p>The virtues are not inborn, but neither can they simply be taught. Virtues are like skills in that neither is innate, and both are acquired through a kind of learning by doing that is not a mere matter of copying or repetition but requires understanding and a capacity for improvisation in the context of new situations. Emulation of a virtuous exemplar is never simply a matter of rote imitation but involves a deepening grasp, affective as well as cognitive, of what is worth doing and being and why. From infancy, we come equipped with certain capacities and preferences, for empathy and compassion, for kindness and fairness.<a class=\"anchor\" id=\"content100note4anc\" name=\"content100note4anc\">\u00a0</a><a class=\"note\" href=\"#content100note4sym\">[\u00a04\u00a0]</a> These provide raw materials for the development of the virtues. In early childhood, the family provides the most significant site for ethical formation, as children learn both through direct instruction and example what counts as \u201ckind,\u201d \u201cbrave,\u201d \u201cgenerous,\u201d \u201cfair,\u201d \u201ctruthful,\u201d and so on. But it does not suffice that a child learns the meanings of these virtue concepts, nor simply learns that acting in these ways elicits affirmation and approval from parents and others. Children must come to aspire for the approval of those whose goodness they admire, not merely for the approval of those who have power in their lives.<a class=\"anchor\" id=\"content100note5anc\" name=\"content100note5anc\">\u00a0</a><a class=\"note\" href=\"#content100note5sym\">[\u00a05\u00a0]</a> And ultimately, their commitment to the good must become independent of such approval. Children must grasp for themselves that being kind, brave, fair, and truthful is good and desirable for its own sake, and desire to become this kind of person. This is possible because moral education harnesses given preferences and motivations, engaging the child in an ongoing process of reflection that shapes and refines existing desires, emotions, and judgments. We love and admire those we experience to be caring and generous, and we desire to become like those we admire.<a class=\"anchor\" id=\"content100note6anc\" name=\"content100note6anc\">\u00a0</a><a class=\"note\" href=\"#content100note6sym\">[\u00a06\u00a0]</a> We imaginatively adopt the ways our exemplars perceive and respond to the world. A child longs to emulate young Jesus, teaching in the temple, or the boy who offered up his loaves and fishes. And even young children are engaged in a complex process of working through tensions amongst the various things and people they find good and admirable, guided by trusted adults who provide reasons that point out salient features of circumstances and motivations. Jalen knows that it is unfair if Tala is given a cookie and he is not. But is it unfair if Tala and Jalen were told that each would receive a cookie if they helped mix the cookies, and only Tala was given a cookie because only Tala helped? Reflection on such ordinary situations, and on the feelings and responses we have in such contexts, enables the development of practical reasoning.</p>\n<h3>Our Characters Continue to Develop:\u00a0</h3>\n<p>The development of the virtues is not completed within childhood but extends across the lifespan, insofar as acting well further strengthens our virtues while acting poorly undermines them. While Aristotle was pessimistic about the possibility of developing the virtues in adulthood, Christians have always affirmed the possibility of transformations of heart and character at any age. Today, psychological research is confirming the possibility of ongoing characterological change.<a class=\"anchor\" id=\"content100note7anc\" name=\"content100note7anc\">\u00a0</a><a class=\"note\" href=\"#content100note7sym\">[\u00a07\u00a0]</a> As we mature, we encounter new circumstances; a steady disposition to generosity within the family may not neatly translate into generosity outside the home; courage on the soccer field into courage in the face of chronic illness, and so forth. Both Martha and Mary are exemplars, but how are we to emulate both? Integrity across domains becomes a new challenge.<a class=\"anchor\" id=\"content100note8anc\" name=\"content100note8anc\">\u00a0</a><a class=\"note\" href=\"#content100note8sym\">[\u00a08\u00a0]</a> Both our commitment to the good and our discernment of how to act well in the context of varied circumstances are at stake.</p>\n<h3>Communities Play a Key Role:\u00a0</h3>\n<p>Personal relationships, communities and institutions all play a critical role in enabling persons to develop and sustain the virtues. Virtues are cultivated in the context of communities that lift up exemplars, pass down inspiring narratives of life lived well amidst circumstances both supportive and challenging, and offer both bracing truth-telling and a sense of belonging within which it becomes possible to face up to our own deep flaws and reaffirm our commitment to develop finer-grained moral discernment and more whole-hearted devotion to the good. All of these important features are present within communities of faith. Biblical exemplars are often deeply flawed, enabling us to identify our own flawed selves with them while renewing our ethical and spiritual aspiration. Think of Peter, eager to show his faithfulness to Jesus, who nevertheless in fear denies his connection to him, or the disciples unable to stay awake in the Garden of Gethsemane. Communities of faith invite persons to orient their lives to God, opening themselves to the grace-filled transformation of all finite concerns and commitments, now known and loved in relation to their divine source and ground.</p>\n<h3>We Encounter Ongoing Challenges:\u00a0</h3>\n<p>When all goes well in this process, desires and emotions harmonize with increasingly refined judgments, in a process that goes on as long as a person continues to encounter new situations and circumstances.<a class=\"anchor\" id=\"content100note9anc\" name=\"content100note9anc\">\u00a0</a><a class=\"note\" href=\"#content100note9sym\">[\u00a09\u00a0]</a> As one acquires the virtues, one develops an ever-richer grasp of what is worth doing and being and works toward a fuller integration of all of one\u2019s loves and commitments. This often involves coming to see the limitations of those who have served as one\u2019s exemplars, and a finer-grained grasp of their virtues and vices. We learn to emulate in more discerning ways. We come to be critically appreciative of our communities and of the ways in which they have deformed as well as formed us. Dispositions that enable us to act well in strictly limited circumstances\u2014on the playing field, or within the congregation\u2014grow in ways that enable fine-grained perception and response in a wide array of circumstances. For many of us, though, the virtues do not develop in such a smooth fashion. We may take pleasure not in acting well, but in self-indulgences that harm and deprive others, failing to attend to the viciousness of our patterns of behaving. Or we may have a commitment to standing up for the oppressed but fail time and time again, fearful of losing the favor of powerful others. Or we may succeed in surface generosity while experiencing giving as difficult and unpleasant. These are three distinct ways of falling short of acting virtuously: self-indulgence, weakness of will, and continence. The self-indulgent person follows pleasure, acting well only by accident, when doing the kind, generous, courageous thing just happens to be pleasant. The weak-willed want to act well but experience other, conflicting desires that carry the day. And the continent person succeeds in acting well, but finds it a struggle to do so. To be virtuous, in contrast, involves not only consistently acting well but having a character such that one finds it pleasant to act fairly, courageously, and generously and is no longer capable of taking pleasure or satisfaction in acting any other way.</p>\n<h2>What Virtues are Not\u00a0</h2>\n<p>Human beings have both temperamental and acquired dispositions that do not count as virtues.</p>\n<h3>Compared to Personality Traits:\u00a0</h3>\n<p>Temperamental dispositions are personality traits like being extroverted, anxious, or talkative. We also have acquired dispositions that arise out of experience, as when a person becomes withdrawn as a result of trauma or abuse. An influential psychological theory introduced in the 1980s identifies the \u201cBig Five\u201d personality traits as openness, conscientiousness, extraversion, agreeableness, and neuroticism.<a class=\"anchor\" id=\"content100note10anc\" name=\"content100note10anc\">\u00a0</a><a class=\"note\" href=\"#content100note10sym\">[\u00a010\u00a0]</a> Temperament is generally regarded as biologically based and permanent. Even Aristotle spoke of \u201cnatural virtues,\u201d noting that each person seems to have a certain type of character from birth.<a class=\"anchor\" id=\"content100note11anc\" name=\"content100note11anc\">\u00a0</a><a class=\"note\" href=\"#content100note11sym\">[\u00a011\u00a0]</a> These do not count as virtues in the proper sense because a virtue enables its possessor to respond appropriately to a wide range of differing circumstances, and this flexibility of response requires knowledge and understanding of what one is doing and why; the virtuous agent, argues Aristotle, not only acts out of a stable disposition, but also deliberately and voluntarily chooses the act, and chooses it for its own sake.<a class=\"anchor\" id=\"content100note12anc\" name=\"content100note12anc\">\u00a0</a><a class=\"note\" href=\"#content100note12sym\">[\u00a012\u00a0]</a></p>\n<h3>Compared to Skills:\u00a0</h3>\n<p>While character virtues are similar to skills, they importantly differ in that a skill can be used to either good or bad ends. Grit, or persistence in the face of difficulty, has been hailed as key to success in a wide range of endeavors from school to business and the arts.<a class=\"anchor\" id=\"content100note13anc\" name=\"content100note13anc\">\u00a0</a><a class=\"note\" href=\"#content100note13sym\">[\u00a013\u00a0]</a> Grit is a skill, however, not a virtue; a gritty criminal is able to inflict much more harm than a lazy or distractible criminal. In order to count as the virtue of perseverance, perfective of its possessor, the skill involved in grit must be holistically good and directed to good ends.</p>\n<h3>In Relation to Intellectual Virtues:\u00a0</h3>\n<p>One traditional division among the virtues, reaching back to Aristotle, is that between the intellectual virtues and the moral virtues.\u00a0 A person can possess intellectual virtues, dispositions that perfect their capacities for the attainment of knowledge, independently of possessing the moral virtues, which make a person\u2019s actions and character good.\u00a0 Absent the moral virtues, one can make bad use of an intellectual virtue, as a person\u2019s capacities for the pursuit of knowledge can be put to bad ends.\u00a0 The intellectual virtues are thus virtues only in a qualified sense, since perfecting the intellect alone does not ensure that we desire and will what is good.\u00a0 Intellectual virtue is thus better characterized as skill.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0</p>\n<p>Some thinkers are willing to consider traits such as good memory and excellent perception as intellectual virtues. These, however, are best thought of as natural traits rather than virtues. Better candidates for intellectual virtues properly speaking, as dispositional traits subject to cultivation, would be skills in abstraction, inference, imagination, and synthesis. It is possible to be a brilliant scientist, possessing a host of intellectual virtues or skills, while lacking the moral virtues that make one a good person. On the other hand, excellent scientists often have a host of moral virtues as well, including patience, humility, courage, and honesty, which enable them to make good use of their intellectual skills, directing them to good ends, and perfecting their actions and character.</p>\n<h2>Virtues Enable Flourishing\u00a0</h2>\n<p>The observation that the wicked prosper is age-old. To understand the virtues is to grasp that the wicked, even if they gain power or wealth, cannot possibly prosper in an ultimate sense; the virtues are essential to human flourishing. It is certainly not the case that things always go well for virtuous people; circumstances can be recalcitrant and dramatically impede flourishing, as witnessed by the righteous indignation of Jesus in the temple and his agony on the cross. However, the virtues heal our inner conflicts. They transform our affections so that we enjoy acting well, taking pleasure in what is good. They equip us to resist injustice and to work for institutions that support human flourishing in community. The virtues thus never detract from happiness; they enable a person to flourish as fully as is possible amidst whatever conditions that person confronts.<a class=\"anchor\" id=\"content100note14anc\" name=\"content100note14anc\">\u00a0</a><a class=\"note\" href=\"#content100note14sym\">[\u00a014\u00a0]</a> To have the virtues is to be equipped to live well, come what may.</p>\n<p>Acting virtuously is functioning well as a human person, with desires, emotions, judgments, and projects harmonizing with one another. It is thus intrinsically pleasant. While those who are self-indulgent or weak-willed take pleasure in pursuing desires that are unhinged from a person\u2019s judgments concerning what is good and worth seeking, the virtuous can find no pleasure in acting viciously. While virtuous action is inherently pleasant, the virtuous person does not act well instrumentally, with a view to experiencing this pleasure. Nor is the virtuous person\u2019s ultimate reason for acting her own perfection. This would be objectionably egocentric. Rather, to be virtuous is to act as one does because one cares for their own sake about the goods at stake in particular situations\u2014because this person is hurting and in need of comfort, say, or because the truth must be told despite powerful interests in concealment. The virtuous person seeks to act well because acting well is <em>good</em>, not merely because it is good <em>for me</em>.<a class=\"anchor\" id=\"content100note15anc\" name=\"content100note15anc\">\u00a0</a><a class=\"note\" href=\"#content100note15sym\">[\u00a015\u00a0]</a></p>\n<p>Christians grasp this pursuit of the good as a pursuit of God. We come to know and love God ever more fully as we develop the virtues, for in and through the virtues we come to grasp and align our agency with the various finite goods that are grounded in God\u2019s perfect goodness. In Jesus we encounter this perfected agency in alignment with the good.</p>\n<p>Given that the virtuous person\u2019s motivation and reasons for acting flow from the good as such, rather than from the agent\u2019s particular good, the virtues are no more oriented to personal than to social flourishing. To have the virtues is to be disposed to act well in relation to other individuals and to one\u2019s various communities. It is to seek their flourishing as one seeks one\u2019s own flourishing, as intrinsically good. The virtuous person will not cultivate habits of lying, cheating, or stealing in order to promote the social welfare, but this is not because she values her own character above the common good. Rather, it is because welfare achieved by such means is not genuine social flourishing.</p>\n<h2>Which Virtues?\u00a0</h2>\n<p>There is no exhaustive list of the virtues. Wherever there is a distinct challenge to our ability to feel, judge, and respond well, we can identify a virtue that perfects our dispositions with respect to that particular difficulty. We need the virtue of honesty because it is tempting to use falsehoods to protect ourselves and our projects; perseverance because we are inclined to give up when the going gets tough. If we consider the virtues as perfecting character with respect to challenges to acting well that arise from our physical and social environments, it is evident that people face distinct obstacles in different times and places, and hence that they need different virtues. Constancy, for instance, has been identified as a distinctively modern virtue required for navigating the fragmented social spheres of contemporary life.<a class=\"anchor\" id=\"content100note16anc\" name=\"content100note16anc\">\u00a0</a><a class=\"note\" href=\"#content100note16sym\">[\u00a016\u00a0]</a> On the other hand, if we consider the virtues with reference to how they perfect dimensions of human agency itself, responding to challenges that arise from within, we arrive at virtues of perennial significance, vital to living well in any circumstances. What does it mean to say that Christ was perfectly virtuous? This does not mean that there is a definitive, all-encompassing list of virtues, and that he had all of these. Rather, the claim is that his character was such that he responded perfectly, in his desires, perceptions, emotions, deliberations, decisions, and actions, in all the situations he encountered.</p>\n<h3>Cardinal Virtues:\u00a0</h3>\n<p>Christian thinkers, building on pagan thinkers of antiquity, most notably Aristotle and Cicero, have long identified four major challenges to acting well arising out of the character of human agency (our passions, will, and practical intellect) and thus four corresponding major virtues, which are known as the cardinal virtues. Other virtues have typically been subsumed under these four.</p>\n<h3>Theological Virtues<em>:</em>\u00a0</h3>\n<p>Indebted as Christian reflection on the virtues has been to pagan antiquity, it has also critiqued and transformed that heritage. For instance, the crucified Jesus and his martyred followers, rather than heroic warriors, have been regarded as foremost epitomes of courage.<a class=\"anchor\" id=\"content100note17anc\" name=\"content100note17anc\">\u00a0</a><a class=\"note\" href=\"#content100note17sym\">[\u00a017\u00a0]</a> The difficult good to be pursued is not earthly glory but love and service of God and neighbor. The vulnerable and powerless are not to be despised and exploited, but embraced and upheld. Christian thinkers have also held that persons are in need of the theological virtues of faith, hope, and love in order to be able to act well in relationship to God, who transcends finite earthly goods, and in order to love enemies as well as friends (1 Cor. 13:13; Matt. 5:44).</p>\n<p>Different Christian thinkers and traditions have developed distinctive emphases in their accounts of the virtues. Augustine, influenced by the ancient Stoic view of the unity of virtue, regarded all of the cardinal virtues as expressions of the love of God and neighbor commanded by Jesus as the summary of the law (Matt. 22:37). Aquinas, who was more concerned to develop a systematic account of the virtues that integrated insights from Aristotle\u2019s ethics, developed an intricate account of the cardinal and theological virtues, including a host of subordinate virtues, all infused by grace and nourished by the life of faith. Lutheran and Reformed thinkers, underscoring the fallenness of human will and reason and the centrality of scripture as God\u2019s revealed law, picked up and further developed Scholastic treatments of the various virtues as correlated with and amplifying the moral skeleton provided by the Ten Commandments (Ex. 20:1-17). For all of these thinkers, divine law and the virtues go hand in hand.</p>\n<h2>Virtues are Interconnected\u00a0</h2>\n<p>No single virtue can be perfected in the absence of the others. This may seem implausible at first glance. It seems commonsensical to affirm that a person may be courageous but impatient, or scrupulously fair but stingy. Yet as soon as we think about what is involved in possessing a virtue, we see how each is connected with many others. Possession of the virtue of generosity, for instance, is not simply a matter of spontaneous giving. A person\u2019s generosity is flawed if she gives away what belongs to another, or gives someone something that will harm or offend them. Perfected generosity thus requires good judgment, that is, practical wisdom. It also requires justice, even courage. Given the interconnectedness of the virtues, it is only possible to possess a virtue in its full, perfected, form if one possesses all of the other virtues as well. The upshot here may be easier for Christians than for others to acknowledge, given the Christian confession that Jesus Christ is the only perfect human person. This leaves ample room for recognizing <em>imperfect</em> virtues in ourselves and others, and for recognizing that each of us typically possesses certain virtues more fully than others. Indeed, just as Paul speaks of spiritual gifts that are variously distributed among individuals for the upbuilding of the Body of Christ, so we can rejoice that some of us excel in the virtue of kindness, being exquisitely sensitive to the needs of those around us, while others are noteworthy for their courage, their willingness to speak out in the face of injustices on behalf of the marginalized and downtrodden.</p>\n<p>Acting together, the virtues heal persons of inner conflict of desire against desire and desire against judgment, equipping a person to discern and seek good ends and to deliberate well concerning good and appropriate means to these ends.</p>\n<h2>Christian Virtues are Infused and Acquired\u00a0</h2>\n<p>We have explored how the virtues are acquired through a complex process in which a person admires virtuous exemplars, desires to be like them, discerns the distinctive forms of goodness they embody, imagines an ideal self that is relevantly like them, and seeks to act accordingly, critically examining their failures and successes along the way. For Christians, this process is shaped in fundamental ways by life in the church.<a class=\"anchor\" id=\"content100note18anc\" name=\"content100note18anc\">\u00a0</a><a class=\"note\" href=\"#content100note18sym\">[\u00a018\u00a0]</a> Exemplars are encountered in scripture and worship and potluck dinners and church ministries. Jesus Christ, as perfectly human, fully exemplifies the virtues. The saints, too, serve as spiritual and moral exemplars, with their depiction in stained glass windows, altars, and sculptures serving to inspire the faithful. Scriptural narratives display virtues (and sometimes vices) in rich detail; the virtue of courage comes to life in the story of Esther; the vice of greed in the parable of the rich fool.</p>\n<h3>A Gift of Divine Grace:\u00a0</h3>\n<p>Christian thinkers from Augustine through Thomas Aquinas and Jonathan Edwards have also insisted that the virtues are a gift of divine grace, building on Paul\u2019s talk of God\u2019s love being <em>poured</em> into believers\u2019 hearts by the Holy Spirit (Rom. 5:5), and therefore speaking in terms of the infusion of moral and theological virtues through the sacraments. While some thinkers have held that only the theological virtues are infused, while the moral virtues are acquired, others have insisted that Christians receive infused moral virtues, too, in order to be effectively oriented to God as final end and equipped for the new life of faith. Scholastic thinkers also identified a distinctive role for the scriptural gifts of the Holy Spirit (Isaiah 11:2\u20133), disposing persons to be moved directly by the Holy Spirit.<a class=\"anchor\" id=\"content100note19anc\" name=\"content100note19anc\">\u00a0</a><a class=\"note\" href=\"#content100note19sym\">[\u00a019\u00a0]</a></p>\n<h3>Not a Form of Works-Righteousness:\u00a0</h3>\n<p>Grasping the character of virtues as gifts heals our sinful tendency to regard them as a means of earning salvation. The virtues are not another form of works-righteousness, and fallen human beings lack the capacity to acquire the virtues through their own autonomous effort. This does not mean, however, that Christians need not be fully involved in the process of cultivating these grace-given virtues. Divine and human agency do not exclude or compete with one another when it comes to growth in the virtues.<a class=\"anchor\" id=\"content100note20anc\" name=\"content100note20anc\">\u00a0</a><a class=\"note\" href=\"#content100note20sym\">[\u00a020\u00a0]</a> Spiritual disciplines such as repentance, self-examination, and prayer join with common practices of admiration, emulation, and aspiration in cultivating virtue.<a class=\"anchor\" id=\"content100note21anc\" name=\"content100note21anc\">\u00a0</a><a class=\"note\" href=\"#content100note21sym\">[\u00a021\u00a0]</a> Grace orients human beings to the God whose transcendent goodness is beyond our grasp, and heals sinful tendencies that distort our desires and commitments and lead us to privilege ourselves and our in-groups.</p>\n<h2>Virtues among Non-Christians\u00a0</h2>\n<p>If the virtues are grace-given, does this mean that Christians deny the possession of virtues by non-Christians? Early and medieval Christians wrestled with this question in the form of the possibility of pagan virtue. Augustine famously considered the virtues of pagan Rome to be in reality splendid vices, corrupted at their heart by pride. Whereas the pagan pursuit of virtue was a pursuit of glory and honor for the self, Christian virtues were grounded in humble acceptance of grace and oriented to God, not self. But even Augustine held that Christians could learn a great deal by studying and emulating certain pagan heroes. Medieval scholastic thinkers, meanwhile, argued that pagans possessed genuine, if imperfect, civic or acquired virtues. They noted that pagan thinkers were capable of recognizing that self-giving service to the common good was distinct from, and corrupted by, the pursuit of glory for oneself. The end of living well in earthly community was not a false end but one that, rightly understood, could be related harmoniously with the ultimate end of glorifying God.<a class=\"anchor\" id=\"content100note22anc\" name=\"content100note22anc\">\u00a0</a><a class=\"note\" href=\"#content100note22sym\">[\u00a022\u00a0]</a> Pagan virtue could thus be seen as oriented to a good proximate or penultimate end, even if not (or not consciously) to God as ultimate end.</p>\n<p>We can affirm, further, that it is not solely through the sacraments or the life of Christian faith that grace is given or virtue infused. Our very being is divine gift, and there are no limits on the workings of divine grace. Many Christians, particularly within Reformed Christian traditions, affirm a doctrine of common grace, through which God bestows providential blessings on all humankind. In some sense, then, we can appropriately affirm all virtues, whether those of Christians or of non-Christians, as both acquired and infused, grace-given and developed through human agency. It is of course true at the same time that grasping one\u2019s being, agency, and virtues as grace-given is profoundly transformative. It is therefore appropriate to speak of an added special gift/grace that transforms our perception of and relation to all other goods when we understand ourselves as creatures invited into friendship with God.</p>\n<h2>The Imperfections of Christian Virtues\u00a0</h2>\n<p>If the virtues of non-Christians remain imperfect in not being exercised for the sake of friendship with God, the virtues of Christians, too, remain imperfect in a host of ways. Augustine emphasized that virtue remains a struggle for Christians in this life, echoing Paul in Galatians 5:17. Aquinas argued that the infused virtues suffice to direct Christians toward their ultimate end in God, but they often coexist with contrary acquired dispositions. Hence, the infused virtues do not, at least initially, enable Christians to act well easily and with pleasure. Reformation thinkers underscored the radical character of human sinfulness, stressing that sinful inclinations remain active in the faithful. There is no tidy contrast to be drawn between the virtuousness of Christians and the viciousness of non-Christians. Christians affirm the perfect virtue of Jesus Christ, but by that same token do not look for this perfection in mere human beings.</p>\n<h2>Virtues, Society, and Institutions\u00a0</h2>\n<p>Virtues are dispositions of individual persons, stable tendencies to feel, perceive, respond, judge, and act in good ways. Can we also speak of the virtues of institutions? Social practices, institutions, and communities can be conducive, or not, to developing and sustaining the virtues. We have already seen this in the case of the church and its varied practices. In this sense, we can speak analogously of virtuous institutions when their organizing principles and daily practices are such as to support the virtues of those who inhabit them. Take as an example the volunteer mountain rescue services that operate in regions around the world. Teams of world-class climbers and guides volunteer their time, training and carrying out complicated rescue operations, often saving hapless hikers who have failed to follow basic safety precautions. These organizations model courage, discipline, dedication, and compassion. To participate in an organization of this kind is to refine one\u2019s grasp of these virtues, of the goods they secure, and of their intrinsic value. This is not to say that every person who participates in such an organization will develop its associated virtues. Brash daredevils, too, might be attracted into mountain rescue activities, and might fail to develop their associated virtues. To the extent that they fail to do so, they fail to become good rescuers.</p>\n<p>While we can easily think of institutions that support the cultivation of virtues, it is also not difficult to identify institutions that cultivate vices as well as or instead of virtues. While participation in team sports can cultivate persistence, cooperation, and loyalty, becoming part of the institution of professional sports can have a corrupting effect on character, as the pursuit of money and fame swamp the goods intrinsic to athletic competition. This is not to say that money or fame are evil; money is a social institution that supports the exchange of goods and services, and fame or honor is bound up with the social recognition of excellence and thus with the cultivation of the virtues. The pursuit of money and fame as ends in themselves, however, has a corrupting effect on character. It is possible to maintain the virtues associated with athletics while participating in professional sports, but it is not easy.</p>\n<p>Nuanced analyses of different social institutions, from families, schools, and neighborhood associations to advocacy groups, social media, markets, the law, and political institutions, can yield a finely differentiated understanding of the ways in which each, in particular times and places, supports or undermines the development of specific virtues and vices.</p>\n<h2><strong>The Virtues in the University</strong>\u00a0</h2>\n<h3>The Virtues in Scholarly Life are Not Just Intellectual:\u00a0</h3>\n<p>In reflecting on the virtues associated with academic life as a practice, we might think first and foremost of the intellectual virtues as those most directly fostered by the academy and by the scholarly life. As we have seen, however, intellectual virtues are not good in an unqualified sense, since perfection of the intellect, of our capacities for learning and knowledge, need not go hand-in-hand with perfection of the will and affections, of one\u2019s commitment to the good. Universities gather together many individuals who possess natural traits that suit them to the life of the mind: sharp memory, keen analytic skills, capacities for abstraction, for synthesis. Universities are, moreover, a site for the cultivation of such capacities into intellectual virtues, developed skills of the intellect. Whether or not these intellectual virtues will be joined together with character virtues is an open question.</p>\n<p>There certainly are character virtues that are particularly important to the life of the mind. One of these is intellectual humility, which is characterized by an appropriate degree of confidence in one\u2019s beliefs and judgments and an appropriate openness to arguments and evidence that might undermine these commitments.<a class=\"anchor\" id=\"content100note23anc\" name=\"content100note23anc\">\u00a0</a><a class=\"note\" href=\"#content100note23sym\">[\u00a023\u00a0]</a> Another is perseverance, the virtue that facilitates sustained effort over the long haul in the face of setbacks and challenges. Fairness is needed, in order to treat students appropriately, avoiding playing favorites. So is kindness, as students and colleagues alike encounter difficulty and discouragement. The more we reflect, the more we are forced to recognize that the scholarly life cannot flourish in a holistic way without the full panoply of the virtues.</p>\n<h3>Vices that Hound the University:\u00a0</h3>\n<p>In order to think well about the virtues that can be fostered within academic life as a practice, and by the university as a social institution, it is equally important to be attentive to the particular vices that are often cultivated in these contexts. Universities, like other social organizations, seek to create incentive structures that will elicit greater levels of effort and thus higher levels of performance. However, these incentives do not simply elicit effort; they also shape character, often in pernicious ways. Individuals who are initially drawn into the academy by their love of the pursuit of truth or their desire to contribute to productively addressing some social crisis or challenge, may come to care more about the recognition they receive for their discoveries than for the discoveries themselves or for the good accomplished in and through them. They may come to measure their value by the size of their compensation packages. They may be tempted to cut corners with their research to accelerate publication or pad their cvs in order to make a stronger impression on others. Faculty members may neglect their teaching or their responsibilities to students, since these receive comparatively little institutional attention or recognition. Each of us likely able to recall some brilliant but callous colleague, unwilling to invest in the common life of a department and skilled at triggering paralyzing self-doubt in others.</p>\n<h3>Policies Supportive of the Virtues in the Life of Universities:\u00a0</h3>\n<p>Universities can work to develop policies that weave fairness, transparency, and care into the daily life of the institution so that it is less vulnerable to individual faults and foibles. They can support rather than undermine the cultivation of character virtues as well as intellectual virtues by avoiding policies that create perverse incentive structures. For instance, universities can offer public recognition not merely of those achievements that bring in the most research dollars and that contribute most to the university\u2019s reputation and ranking, but also those habits and dispositions that contribute to the holistic flourishing of the university as a human community\u2014devoted teaching, patient mentoring, fair and efficient administration, and so forth. They can avoid using money as the primary measure of achievement and contribution, while ensuring no employee is exploited or treated in ways incommensurate with their dignity as human beings.</p>\n<p>Attention to incentive structures must go hand in hand with policies that foster a strong sense of community and belonging. The virtues thrive in contexts in which persons feel affirmed and supported as well as challenged to become their best selves for the sake of a common mission. There is a place for healthy competition, which can elicit striving towards shared goals, but only within a broader context in which individuals feel safe enough to risk failure because they know that their ultimate value does not ride on winning a competition.</p>\n<p>Of course, university administrators are often under pressure to rise in the research rankings, as this is a critical pathway to securing the funds that sustain the research enterprise and attract top faculty and students. Yet university mission statements typically articulate a commitment to the promotion of intrinsic rather than merely instrumental goods. My own university\u2019s statement is representative: \u201cYale is committed to improving the world today and for future generations through outstanding research and scholarship, education, preservation, and practice.\u201d<a class=\"anchor\" id=\"content100note24anc\" name=\"content100note24anc\">\u00a0</a><a class=\"note\" href=\"#content100note24sym\">[\u00a024\u00a0]</a> The culture of the university ought itself to be aligned with these goals. Just as a commitment to cutting-edge research on carbon containment rings hollow when carried out on a campus that makes no effort at carbon containment, so the lofty commitment to improving the world ought similarly to begin at home, with the alignment on all fronts of the inner workings of our institutions with the ultimate ends they seek. We can begin to improve the world by fostering the virtues, without which holistic flourishing is impossible. By attending to the virtues and vices that are fostered by university life, by its institutional structures, policies, and cultures, and by working to transform these for the better, we can contribute to greater individual and social flourishing.</p>\n<h3>The Virtues in Diverse Scholarly Disciplines and Scholarly Agendas<strong>:</strong>\u00a0</h3>\n<p>As scholars, we can be attentive not just to the characterological dimensions of the scholarly life as such, and to the university as an institution that is formative of character, but also to how our respective disciplines and individual scholarly agendas might help to contribute to the creation of communities of genuine human flourishing by contributing to building the character of the persons that constitute these communities. Laws, for instance, do not simply prescribe and prohibit actions, but also play a role in shaping the character of citizens. How might legal scholarship attend more fully to this feature of the law?<a class=\"anchor\" id=\"content100note25anc\" name=\"content100note25anc\">\u00a0</a><a class=\"note\" href=\"#content100note25sym\">[\u00a025\u00a0]</a> Public policy can be designed in ways that respect and foster practical wisdom, rather than merely manipulating citizens as objects of social engineering. Search engine algorithms can be built in ways that foster awareness of complexity and ambiguity and therefore encourage conscious reflection rather than reinforcing stereotypes.<a class=\"anchor\" id=\"content100note26anc\" name=\"content100note26anc\">\u00a0</a><a class=\"note\" href=\"#content100note26sym\">[\u00a026\u00a0]</a> The arts can powerfully shape perception and affective responsiveness to goods at stake in complex circumstances, fostering compassion and courage. Engineering can be oriented to flourishing in equitable community, guided by the virtue of justice. Business leaders and regulators can acknowledge that profit is not an ultimate human good and can work towards a more humane economy, one that serves genuine human needs and a more just and sustainable world for all creatures.<a class=\"anchor\" id=\"content100note27anc\" name=\"content100note27anc\">\u00a0</a><a class=\"note\" href=\"#content100note27sym\">[\u00a027\u00a0]</a></p>\n<p>Consideration of how our activities shape character should also extend to all dimensions of the academic life, ranging from our participation in scholarly societies, our involvement in scholarly publishing, grant-getting and grant-making activities, our social media presence, public scholarship, and all of the diverse ways in which our lives as academics are lived out beyond as well as within the walls of the university. In every dimension of our lives, our actions are expressive of our character and work in ways that contribute to the formation of others\u2019 character.</p>\n<h2>Conclusion\u00a0</h2>\n<p>The virtues assist us in developing lives worth living and communities worth inhabiting. Christians can unite with those of other faiths and of no faith to attend to the ways in which our academic agendas, practices and institutions, form and de-form character and to how they can be remade in the service of holistic flourishing. Christians can grasp how the virtues that we cultivate are God\u2019s generous gift poured into our lives, and seek to live in ever-deeper awareness of the divine Goodness that grounds our being, inviting us to partake of the joy of the divine life.</p>\n<h2>Further Reading\u00a0</h2>\n<p>Adams, Robert M. <em>A Theory of Virtue: Excellence in Being for the </em>Good.

    "bodyText": "GFI scholars are keenly aware of the need for a host of virtues in educational and research contexts, and concerned about the ways in which these contexts often tend instead to facilitate the cultivation of various vices. Hubertus Roebben, Pauline Chiu, and Rafael Vicu\u00f1a all worry about the damaging effects on character of a publish or perish research environment. Pressure to deliver outcomes, and quickly, elbows out attention to complexity and the kind of deep, substantial reflection that issues from \u201cslow research\u201d ( Roebben ). Along with compromises in the quality of research, it is often students who suffer, as supervisors exploit their labor and fail to provide either formation or worthy role models ( Chiu , Vicu\u00f1a ). If faculty do not display the necessary virtues of generosity, justice, courage, humility, and selflessness ( Dean , Gill , Kong ), how are students to be expected to cultivate these dispositions, rather than simply reproducing the deformations they experience all around them?\n\nNicholas Wolterstorff , while also very much alive to these characteristic deformations of academic life, begins to provide a response here by reminding us not just of the virtues needed in the (philosophy) classroom, but also of the attractions of the life of the mind. Nearly all of us fell in love with this life at some point along the way. We did not choose our disciplines for the sake of success and prestige, since success and prestige are external goods, available through many avenues. [\u00a01\u00a0] Rather, we encountered something particular about philosophy or economics or psychology or what have you, something that we found deeply appealing, that fascinated or stymied or moved us, that activated our minds and released our energies. We are not used to thinking of bafflement or amazement as virtues. Indeed, typically they are not\u2014they are attitudes or experiences, not stable dispositions. But there is no reason that we can\u2019t speak of a stable disposition to be baffled or amazed in ways that are perfective of action and character, and this would be virtuous bafflement or virtuous amazement.\n\nWe happened, then, upon goods internal to the practice of a particular academic discipline, and these goods drew us in much as a virtuous exemplar draws us in, exciting our admiration and emulation. And, truth be told, in many instances it was through a virtuous exemplar of the discipline that we first came alive to its charms. We wanted not just to grasp those thoughts, or that style of thinking, but we wanted to be like that person, made more vibrantly alive through their grasp of these distinctive internal goods. Oliver O\u2019Donovan \u2019s observation about the ways in which talk of the virtues focuses our attention on admirable others offers a helpful response to those who worry that virtue ethics encourages preoccupation with oneself and one\u2019s own character: \u201cwhen we talk about virtues, we disengage ourselves from our own preoccupations with acting and seek to \u2018distinguish what is excellent\u2019 as seen in the lives of others.\u201d\n\nAugustine explored this dynamic in a particularly powerful way. The acquisition of the virtues, he argued, is not merely a matter of training via repetition, habituation into certain patterns of action. It requires a transformation of the heart and will, an ordering of our loves to genuine goods and ultimately to God, Goodness itself. This takes place insofar as God reveals Godself, God\u2019s supreme beauty, to us. And this transformation can be mediated through the lives of others and even through texts. One of Augustine\u2019s favorite examples is of the power of a narrative, the Life of Antony . He relates a story told by Ponticianus of an imperial agent who, happening upon a copy of the Life of Antony , \u201cbegan to read it, marvelled at it, was inflamed by it,\u201d inspired to devote his life to seeking friendship with God. [\u00a02\u00a0]\n\nSomething of this dynamic is at work in the kind of transformation involved in the development of any virtue, as it involves the way we perceive and feel as well as judge. Reconnecting with this living water, the attractions of wealth and prestige fade. A critical first step is to reconnect with whatever has mediated for us this disclosure of the Good. From this flows the power to resist careerism and to begin to cultivate the array of virtues to which respondents so eloquently point.\n\nReflection on the ways in which educational institutions facilitate the cultivation of various vices and virtues leads us to a question posed by both Terence Halliday and Donald Hay : can we speak of organizations or institutions as having virtues and vices, as being more or less just, temperate, or prudent? Chris Marshall , meanwhile, speaks unhesitatingly of \u201cinstitutional character.\u201d\n\nIn my Preview on the virtues, I suggested that institutions form character and in turn are formed by the character of the people who constitute them. In the Brief itself, I expand on the critical role that social practices, communities, and institutions play (or fail to play) in enabling persons to develop and sustain the virtues. Strictly speaking, virtues cannot be attributed to institutions. This is because virtues, strictly speaking, are dispositions of individual persons, stable tendencies to feel, perceive, respond, judge, and act in good ways, perfective of the agent and of the common good. I do suggest, however, that \u201cwe can speak analogously of virtuous institutions when their organizing principles and daily practices are such as to support the virtues of those who inhabit them.\u201d\n\nOliver O\u2019Donovan , in his response, shows that this approach can be taken further: \u201cwe refer intelligibly... to the \u2018virtues\u2019 of institutions, for though this use of the term is an analogy it is a perfectly valid one. Institutions resemble human agents in embodying a consciousness of some good and a purpose of realizing it.\u201d This is helpful. Aristotle emphasized that the virtuous agent does not merely habitually perform good acts, but chooses their actions deliberately and voluntarily, precisely in order to act well. As O\u2019Donovan notes, institutions can articulate the ends they seek (for instance, in mission statements) and work to ensure that their policies and practices align with these ends. An institution that is organized solely around the maximization of profit is dramatically different from one that seeks to enable a decent life for all its employees, offering products that enhance the lives of those who purchase them and creating a work environment that honors the dignity of all of those touched by the company. We can certainly\u2014and quite profitably\u2014speak of the virtues of such an organization, characterizing it as just and practically wise, perhaps even generous. On the contrary, a company that seeks only to maximize shareholder value, allowing that end to justify any means available, is bound to be deeply vicious, even if its practices remain within the bounds of legality. It will be likely to exploit and overwork its employees, manipulate and deceive customers, and yield products of little value. Nonprofit organizations exist to provide a public good or social benefit, with the requirement that revenues must be directed to the organization\u2019s purpose, so it is easier for a nonprofit organization to resist being derailed by the pursuit of external goods. Yet as we see in the case of universities, for instance, this is no guarantee of institutional virtue. Many universities allow prestige, \u201crankings,\u201d to shoulder out commitment to the substantive internal goods of knowledge and creative inquiry for which they were created. For-profit and nonprofit organizations alike can become vitiated despite the articulation of lofty purposes, when their internal workings are not effectively aligned with these purposes. An institutional culture of backbiting and cutthroat competition can render a workplace inimical to human flourishing, regardless of any lofty mission statements. With institutions as with individuals, certain virtues can exist alongside other vices, but any institutional vice serves to vitiate the whole.\n\nYes, to be sure, but they will chafe at the institutional context in which they find themselves. Chris Marshall notes (pointing to the criminal justice system as an example) that it seems at times that complex institutional forces are at work that seem to defeat the good intentions of individuals at work within them, and this is certainly true. Such individuals can work towards the transformation of institutional character by seeking to articulate genuine goods towards which the institutions can or ought to be oriented, by identifying policies and practices that disproportionately elevate external goods, and by seeking to foster just and caring institutional cultures. The kind of contribution that an individual can make to improving institutional character is constrained by the role of the individual within the institution. Some workers have little influence on organizational policies and practices, while others have immense power for transformation.\n\nKaren Kong makes an important point in this connection: Christians might in some contexts \u201cface the choice of whether to continue to stay on to practice virtues against institutions or political pressure at a high cost and a risk of their own fallenness and stifling, or to sever from those institutions and authorities and find a more nurturing place that enable them to better promote human flourishing.\u201d As Terence Halliday and Karen Man Yee Lee also point out, standing up against authoritarian regimes can require great courage and involve intense suffering. How might a decision of this kind be made well? Implicit in Kong\u2019s articulation of the situation are some of the relevant considerations. Does remaining within the institution bring with it meaningful opportunities to transform it towards justice? Does the individual have the skills and virtues necessary to enact such a transformation, or are they likely only to be broken by the experience? Do others exist with whom common action could be undertaken? Does the individual have special obligations towards particular others who would be deeply affected by the decision to remain or to sever institutional ties? I know persons who have left the academy, or a particular institution, for reasons of conscience, believing that they were not capable of transforming existing structures. Some are whole and at peace; others broken and bitter. It takes the virtue of practical wisdom to reflect well on how to respond to such challenging situations, and the virtue of courage to make and follow through on a difficult and costly decision. Self-knowledge, too, is key: one who thinks they have greater courage and perseverance and practical wisdom than they in fact possess is likely to attempt something of which they are not capable.\n\nAbove, I noted the ways in which a narrow focus on the maximization of profit or shareholder value vitiates the character of for-profit companies. Several respondents had important observations to make that relate to this point. As Susan Thorp notes, the principle of maximizing shareholder value \u201cconveniently offers an \u2018escape clause\u2019 for corporations\u2019 choices that neglect virtue and damage people, exploit the environment and degrade community and institutions.\u201d Ever since Adam Smith, the notion of the invisible hand has been invoked to legitimate self-interested economic behavior as facilitating the efficient workings of markets. Bernard Mandeville argued that private vices gave rise to public benefits. Smith, however, was quite aware that reliance on the invisible hand would not give rise to a decent society, and that efficient markets do not guarantee equity. [\u00a06\u00a0] Much of the discipline of economics is directed at the analysis of unintended consequences of human action that arise through large scale patterns of interaction. The virtues, in contrast, have to do with intentional action; virtuous agent acts in ways they know to be good precisely because they grasp the goodness of so acting. Bringing these two ways of thinking about human action together in ways that serve the common good has proven to be no easy task.\n\nSusan Thorp points out that the mathematical models of financial economics need not assume that economic actors are purely self-interested. If I derive greater satisfaction from drinking coffee produced under fair trade conditions than from coffee not subject to such constraints, this can be captured in my utility function. These models can be useful for description and prediction. At a deeper level, however, these models encourage a kind of homogenizing in which all action is seen as aimed at maximizing utility. And this may have the perverse effect of encouraging self-interest by legitimizing an approach to life conceived in terms of maximizing one\u2019s own utility.\n\nPriscila Viera poses critically important questions concerning digital technologies: are these technologies neutral with respect to the virtues? Can we neatly detach the medium from the message? Are phenomena like social exclusion, individualism, and the fostering of extremism inevitable results of certain technologies, or could the same media also generate community and compassion? These are poignant questions, given the great enthusiasm that greeted the birth of the internet, with many hailing it as an unprecedented boon for global connection and democracy. Now, three decades later, we are more aware of the destructive outworkings of these technologies. The human drive for social connection is easily manipulable, and algorithms designed to maximize profits for Facebook and Google feed polarization, echo chambers, and flash-in-the-pan virality over kindness, truth, and boundary-crossing love. This does not mean that digital technologies generally, or social media in particular, inevitably feed the vices. It does highlight the moral dangers of allowing the drive to maximize profits to operate without constraints.\n\nJocelyn Downey, Victor Li, and Jacqueline Lam raise a related set of questions in their response to the Brief, \u201cVirtue Ethics and Development of an Ethical AI for Social Good.\u201d There is intense attention at present to the need to develop a so-called \u201cethical AI,\u201d given the increasing autonomy of digital systems ranging from self-driving cars to weapons systems capable of making \u201cdecisions\u201d without human intervention. Might a virtue ethical approach be helpful here, they ask? And might \u201cnature itself facilitate development of a bottom-up ethical framework when trained on big data taken across diverse languages and cultures?\u201d This is a fascinating question, given Christian faith that the world, as highlighted by theologian Nigel Biggar in his Brief on \u201cCreated Order,\u201d is the creation of a rational Creator and thus evinces a created order. Might that order come into view as AI systems capable of analyzing vast quantities of data discern patterns indiscernible by human intelligence? Just this has been suggested by theologian Jordan Joseph Wales, who argues that a neural network can begin \u201cto resonate with the entangled relations implicit in our world, including relations not easily discerned or logically represented by human investigators.\u201d A neural network is \u201creceptive to, imprinted by the structure of the world as presented to it.\u201d [\u00a09\u00a0] The problem with using such methods to try to drive a bottom-up development of ethical AI, and in particular to develop a kind of common morality in the midst of global ethical diversity, is that the patterns discerned by neural networks will be the patterns of a fallen creation. As Downey, Li, and Lam note, \u201cAI should carefully avoid being misguided by the inherent order exhibited by data, which may likely reflect the worldviews and behaviours of the sinful as well as Christian virtues.\u201d [\u00a010\u00a0]\n\nDowney, Li, and Lam highlight some of the challenges that attend the attempt to imbue AI systems with the virtues, noting that \u201cif an AI is trained to adjust its behaviour according to the virtues of beneficence, non-maleficence, justice, and explicability, in each case a judgment is needed through trained data provided with given rules, as to whether a behaviour is beneficent, just, maleficent, or explicable.\u201d They therefore suggest a hybrid approach in which virtues are constrained by rules. These are valuable observations. A common approach of data ethicists involves articulating a list of principles that AI systems should honor in order to be ethical. Beneficence, non-maleficence, justice, and explicability are often on the lists (reflecting the influence of the principlist approach to medical ethics developed by Beauchamp and Childress). [\u00a011\u00a0] It is helpful to note the difference between principles and virtues. In medicine, the principle of benevolence expresses the commitment to the importance of medical treatment that actually benefits the patient. Principles must be specified and balanced in relation to other principles; they are not immediately action-guiding. A virtue is a stable disposition to respond well in response to salient considerations in some particular domain. It is possible to endorse the principle of benevolence, and to strive to embed that principle in various systems, while lacking the virtues of love and kindness. One might, for instance, work to ensure that an AI system is benevolent solely in order to protect the public reputation of the company that created it.\n\nDowney, Li, and Lam propose a hybrid approach in which \u201cvirtues are constrained by a series of hard consequences or rules.\u201d Substituting \u201cprinciples\u201d in place of \u201cvirtues\u201d here, I agree that principles must be specified through rules, for instance, in training self-driving cars. But there is an additional complication here. Rules must be applied to situations, and the virtues are needed in order to apply rules wisely. Regardless of how specific the rule, situations will always arise in which there is ambiguity and lack of precedent. Are we prepared to offload responsibility for such judgments to autonomous systems that function as black boxes and that cannot be held responsible? Or does the ineliminability of wise judgment mean that human beings must always be kept in the loop and autonomous machine intelligence kept at bay?\n\nThese reflections on the critical importance of judgment lead nicely into responses from the area of law. Karen Kong notes that the presence of discretionary powers in law means that virtues will always be required. And Nicholas Aroney , emphasizes that \u201cprudent governance will not consist simply in the multiplication of rules in order to secure good conduct. The particular situations to which rules must be applied are too contingent and complex for a discrete set of rules, no matter how sophisticated and comprehensive, to provide sufficient guidance for good conduct in every situation.\u201d Instead of multiplying legislation, we need greater support for civil society organizations that help to form the virtues in their participants. Like Putnam (and other distinguished thinkers, notably Jacques Maritain), Aroney regards these institutions as the key to forming persons of good character. I agree. I am not confident, though, that greater government support of civil society institutions will in and of itself bring people back into the pews. We may need more Spirit-led innovation within these institutions (and notably within the churches) in order to respond effectively to the major cultural shifts that have led to decline.\n\nAnna High offers a nuanced set of reflections on the capacity of a legal system to facilitate or hinder the development of virtues among those governed by it. Certainly we can see how law evolves in response to changing societal norms. For instance, as High notes, the legal understanding of rape now reflects greater regard for human dignity. In the United States, for instance, more states now define rape by reference to lack of consent rather than by reference to the presence of coercion. Indeed, some states define rape by reference to the lack of affirmative consent. High raises important questions about the permissibility of using law as a tool to effect changes in societal norms. Would it be appropriate, for instance, legally to require affirmative consent in a jurisdiction in which this would mean that ubiquitous and previously permissible sexual activity would become criminal? I am a bit hesitant on this score. Where a broad-based social consensus exists, law can be a tool for ethical formation. In the absence of such consensus, I doubt that law can serve as an effective tool for this purpose. Legislating high ideals can be counterproductive, eliciting disrespect for the law. This argument goes back to Thomas Aquinas, who argued that law should be framed for the many, who are far from perfect in character. It should be aimed at more severe forms of viciousness from which the majority are capable of abstaining. If the law sought to legislate perfection, people would become hostile to the law and this would defeat its purpose: \u201cthe purpose of human law is to lead men to virtue, not suddenly, but gradually. Wherefore it does not lay upon the multitude of imperfect men the burdens of those who are already virtuous, viz., that they should abstain from all evil. Otherwise these imperfect ones, being unable to bear such precepts, would break out into yet greater evils.\u201d [\u00a012\u00a0]\n\nA cluster of respondents highlight epistemic virtues and vices, that is, virtues and vices related to beliefs, their acquisition and revision. Epistemic virtues assist their possessors in arriving at the truth. They also govern discursive exchanges, how we engage with others, in our pursuit of truth. Michael Spence notes that epistemic virtues for the conduct of effective discourse are of particular importance in the context of universities. Allan Bell , coming from the perspective of sociolinguistics, highlights the virtues of speaking and listening. John Inazu raises concerns about the ways in which the meanings of key ethical concepts, like \u201cequality\u201d and \u201cjustice,\u201d are often distorted, with the loudest or most influential voices able not merely to capture attention, but to reshape collective perception and judgment. Daniel Hastings , meanwhile, asks how we are to respond to the challenges that surround the post-truth phenomenon, in which basic facts are disputed and lies accepted as truth no matter the evidence.\n\nThese issues have received considerable attention in recent years within so-called \u201cvice epistemology.\u201d Quassim Hassan, for instance, has studied the epistemic vices of \u201cclosed-mindedness, intellectual arrogance, wishful thinking, and prejudice,\u201d analyzing what makes them resistant to change and how we can begin to transform them. [\u00a013\u00a0] Miranda Fricker has analyzed epistemic injustice, in which persons are injured specifically in their capacity as knowers, their voices systematically discounted because of their membership in some subordinated group. Fricker proposes virtues of epistemic justice that can begin to remedy these injustices and correct these vices. [\u00a014\u00a0]\n\nClearly there is an urgent need for better education that assists persons in evaluating the reliability of sources and helps them understand, for instance, the fact that social media algorithms are designed to boost engagement, not to track truth. It is also important to study and make widely known the ways in which human beings tend to form in-groups and out-groups and systematically discount the perspectives of members of out-groups. [\u00a015\u00a0] A major challenge is the erosion of social trust within highly polarized societies. This is a self-reinforcing process in which distrust breeds polarization and polarization exacerbates distrust. In the face of ingrained distrust, education cannot get off the ground. Rebuilding trust is no easy matter and likely requires face-to-face engagement in activities that are not politically freighted, to return again to Robert Putnam\u2019s insights. [\u00a016\u00a0] With the institutions of civil society eroding, from churches to bowling leagues, it is not clear where this kind of engagement will take place. I have argued for the importance of understanding how groups that perceive their social influence eroding are tempted to engage in partisan epistemology. Sadly, this includes Christian faith communities, which are often tempted to engage in epistemic insulation as a protective mechanism. Jesus facing Pilate offers an alternative model: disruptive engagement with a post-truth dominator. Jesus resists epistemic injustice and opens space for the building of unbounded communities of trust and shared understanding. [\u00a017\u00a0]\n\nIn the 19 th century, \u201cmoralism\u201d referred to social movements to spread certain ethical commitments throughout society: the abolitionist and temperance movements are perhaps the best examples. Looking back, we may look rather quizzically at the latter, even as we admire the former as belated but nonetheless courageous and imperative. Over time, however, moralism itself has acquired negative connotations, no longer referring simply to the promotion of social causes on moral grounds, but to being too quick to issue moral judgements concerning others, or too quick to claim moral authority for oneself.\n\nOne good reason to be hesitant concerning moralizing social movements is that they often simplify a complex social reality. David Mahan makes a compelling case both for \u201cthe moral urgency of ambiguity\u201d and for the importance of literature for assisting us to grasp both this ambiguity and its urgency. Literature activates our imaginations and exerts a strong affective pull. We are attracted (or repelled) by whole characters: we find ourselves wanting to be \u201clike that\u201d even where we cannot fully articulate just what it is that we find so attractive. Literature can wake us up, instill a sense of moral urgency, a sense that it matters, deeply, how we respond to what life hands us, and what sort of person we become. Mahan offers us rich examples. This is all music to my ears, and a theme I have myself explored elsewhere. [\u00a018\u00a0] It is worth noting that literature, so understood, can be moralizing without being moralistic, that is, without issuing judgments on others or claiming undue authority; Mahan points to T.S. Eliot\u2019s call for \u201ccriticism from a definite ethical and theological standpoint,\u201d which was compatible with a dislike for preachiness. [\u00a019\u00a0] One concern we might have about contemporary late modern societies is that they are characterized by a certain sort of incoherence: on the one hand, there is an intense dislike of exposure to the moral judgments of those with whom we disagree, while on the other hand, there is nevertheless a tendency to pronounce moral judgments on others within the safety of echo-chambers of the like-minded, or into the internet ether, in which no actual exchange is taking place. It is worth knowing that literature is \u201cslow,\u201d social media is \u201cfast\u201d; we need more social spaces today for decelerated reflection and judgment, spaces that allow for complexity and nuance.\n\nI admire the work that John Peteet is doing to reintroduce the virtues into the arena of mental health. In the context of a therapeutic society, this has doubtless been an uphill battle (as for Tyler VanderWeele in the field of public health). Having considered the significance of virtues of self-control, benevolence, intelligence and positivity for clinical work, he is just getting started, and is now turning to incorporate a virtues-based perspective into diagnostic assessment, goal-setting, and treatment. \u201cClinicians typically eschew the term \u2018vice\u2019 as moralistic,\u201d he notes, \u201cbut maladaptive personality traits or disorders reflect perhaps the most obvious example of a need for virtues.\u201d Doubtless talk of character strengths and vulnerabilities can gain an easier hearing than talk of vices or even of virtues. This is not necessarily a problem; choosing a vocabulary capable of gaining a hearing can be crucial, and the connotations of both \u201cvice\u201d and \u201cvirtue\u201d can close ears and hearts. What is critical, as Peteet recognizes, is that whatever language we use empower the agency of patients. [\u00a020\u00a0] Exclusive use of the paradigm of illness fosters passivity. The patient\u2019s sense of their own agency in the process of moving towards flourishing must be activated. This involves coming to see one\u2019s cares and emotions and motives and attitudes as one\u2019s own even if not freely chosen, as woven into the selfhood with which one reflects and acts, even one can also take up a stand against some of these emotions and motives and seek their transformation. [\u00a021\u00a0] This is a complex process in which, as Peteet notes, the wise therapist can play a valuable role. There is surely nothing moralistic here.\n\nAlana Moore \u2019s poignant observations about \u201cVirtue Ethics vs. Virtue Signalling in the Global Humanitarian System\u201d touch on some related concerns. Recipients of aid, like patients engaged in therapy, are placed in positions of passivity and thus in danger of having their agency be undermined. \u201cThere must be opportunity for the participants,\u201d Moore suggests, \u201cto grasp for themselves what is good and wise and honest, and to desire to be the kind of person who is defined by such attributes.\u201d Virtuous aid workers, meanwhile, are committed to \u201cthe mutual building up of equals in dignity and worth through the world they seek to bring into being together.\u201d The worry that aid workers will be more preoccupied with their own goodness than with the preciousness of those who suffer, and the claims they make on others, is a real one; virtue signalling is indeed a vice, and one particularly endemic to humanitarian institutions. This does not mean, however, that the powerful and the vulnerable are not alike in need of virtues, and in particular \u201cthe overarching virtue of love to bind giver and receiver.\u201d Our worries about moralism and virtue signalling must not be allowed to erode our capacity to name such truths.\n\nTyler VanderWeele, Brendan Case, and Karen Man Yee Lee all take up the question of the relation of virtue to flourishing. VanderWeele and Case note empirical evidence for positive relationships between moral character and flourishing. Case points to a study by Harvard\u2019s Human Flourishing Program that found that \u201ceven the self-assessed \u2018commitment to promoting the good in all circumstances\u2019 is highly predictive of future flourishing in many domains, including social relationships, life satisfaction, and even physical health.\u201d Vanderweele refers to a multitude of studies showing that character-based interventions that promote gratitude, kindness, forgiveness, compassion, patience, and perseverance also have positive effects on happiness, sleep, physical health, depression and anxiety, and educational test scores. At the same time, Vanderweele notes that \u201cgood character, or virtue, is of course not only instrumentally valuable, but intrinsically important in its own right.\u201d Virtue is constitutive of flourishing, not merely instrumental to flourishing. This is a critically important point. And it is helpful to distinguish different kinds of flourishing. It is possible to sleep well, have good physical health, high test scores, and be free of depression and anxiety without having the virtues, even if having the virtues can under certain circumstances conduce to these forms of well-being. It is not possible to flourish tout court , as a human being , however, without the virtues. The virtues perfect our agency and responsiveness to the good such that we respond well regardless of the situations in which we find ourselves.\n\nThis is important for absorbing the force of the observations made by Karen Man Yee Lee and Terence Halliday , who point to the virtues of courage and justice that can strengthen persons risking liberty and livelihood in the face of authoritarian regimes. Here the virtues equip persons to act well in highly difficult situations. At the same time, the exercise of the virtues of courage and justice here can issue in \u201cenormous human suffering.\u201d What are we to say about the connection between virtue and flourishing here? It might seem that having the virtues in this context positively detracts from flourishing; the courageous protester ends up in prison, say, while the ordinary compliant citizen remains free to sleep at home in their beds, receiving quality health care and sending their children to excellent schools.\n\nI have argued that we need to put this differently. [\u00a022\u00a0] The life of the virtues can certainly be accompanied by great suffering. The virtues never, though, detract from flourishing. The virtues equip persons to flourish as fully as possible under the circumstances they confront. We should not be surprised that the virtues are ordinarily conducive to having good physical and mental health, for the virtues bring harmony among our desires, emotions, and judgments and form us such that we find it intrinsically pleasant to act well. We do not always find ourselves in ordinary circumstances, however. We may continue to take satisfaction in acting well in the face of a murderous regime; this does not mean that we enjoy the violations we suffer under such a regime. To the Stoic who insists that the sage is happy even when tortured on the rack, I say that the sage is as happy as it is possible to be given those circumstances, since the sage (by definition one perfect in virtue) responds perfectly to the situation and all the various goods at stake in that situation. Responding differently (say, by betraying the cause and escaping torture) would only make the sage more miserable. The virtuous may have to relinquish worthy projects made impossible by circumstances; at an extreme, they may have to give up their lives. As Oliver O\u2019Donovan wisely notes, \u201csometimes ideals formed by admiration of a worthy object and admirable in themselves may still not be the right guide to the circumstances in which God has placed us.\u201d Christians should not be surprised to hear that perfect happiness is found only in the eschaton.\n\nChristopher Hayes and K.K. Yeo offer rich reflections on the ways in which the cultivation of the virtues can be furthered through intercultural and interreligious exchange. Encounters with those from other traditions makes us aware of both commonalities and local peculiarities. Such encounters can be mutually enriching and transformative. My understanding of the virtues as both acquired and infused, and of the Holy Spirit as unbounded by human cultures and institutions, is hospitable to these encounters. We are called to friendship with God, and friendship involves the free and knowing embrace of intimacy with the friend. That the virtues are ultimately perfected by this friendship does not mean that those who do not seek friendship with God have no virtues, or that Christians have nothing to learn from them. [\u00a023\u00a0]\n\nOliver O\u2019Donovan points to the fact that the Greek Church Fathers regarded love not as a virtue but as an operation of the Holy Spirit, pointing to the insufficiency of virtue and to our dependence on grace. [\u00a024\u00a0] Thomas Aquinas took a different route to a similar end, affirming love\u2019s standing among the virtues but regarding the gifts of the Holy Spirit as additional habits or dispositions that perfect the theological and cardinal virtues by rendering their possessor receptive to the workings of the Holy Spirit. There is a shared affirmation here of the need for a grace that, in O\u2019Donovan\u2019s words, \u201callows our various dispositions and powers to come together to serve God\u2019s purposes effectively.\u201d Our personal resources, however well-developed, do not suffice to fit us for friendship with God. They are perfected as we are opened up to, and learn to rely on, the power of grace in our lives. This is a lesson that any experience of love begins to teach us, but that faith teaches us to begin to name.\n\n[\u00a01\u00a0] On external vs. internal goods, see Alasdair MacIntyre, After Virtue (Notre Dame: University of Notre Dame Press, 1981), 187\u2013192.\n\n[\u00a02\u00a0] Augustine, Confessions Book 8 VIII, ch.6, 137.

    "bodyHtml": "<p>GFI scholars are keenly aware of the need for a host of virtues in educational and research contexts, and concerned about the ways in which these contexts often tend instead to facilitate the cultivation of various vices. Hubertus Roebben, Pauline Chiu, and Rafael Vicu\u00f1a all worry about the damaging effects on character of a publish or perish research environment. Pressure to deliver outcomes, and quickly, elbows out attention to complexity and the kind of deep, substantial reflection that issues from \u201cslow research\u201d (<a href=\"https://globalfacultyinitiative.net/content_item/355\">Roebben</a>). Along with compromises in the quality of research, it is often students who suffer, as supervisors exploit their labor and fail to provide either formation or worthy role models (<a href=\"https://globalfacultyinitiative.net/content_item/1065\">Chiu</a>, <a href=\"https://globalfacultyinitiative.net/content_item/342\">Vicu\u00f1a</a>). If faculty do not display the necessary virtues of generosity, justice, courage, humility, and selflessness (<a href=\"https://globalfacultyinitiative.net/content_item/362\">Dean</a>, <a href=\"https://globalfacultyinitiative.net/content_item/356\">Gill</a>, <a href=\"https://globalfacultyinitiative.net/content_item/350\">Kong</a>), how are students to be expected to cultivate these dispositions, rather than simply reproducing the deformations they experience all around them?</p>\n<p><a href=\"https://globalfacultyinitiative.net/content_item/464\">Nicholas Wolterstorff</a>, while also very much alive to these characteristic deformations of academic life, begins to provide a response here by reminding us not just of the virtues needed in the (philosophy) classroom, but also of the attractions of the life of the mind. Nearly all of us fell in love with this life at some point along the way. We did not choose our disciplines for the sake of success and prestige, since success and prestige are external goods, available through many avenues.<a class=\"anchor\" id=\"content100note1anc\" name=\"content100note1anc\">\u00a0</a><a class=\"note\" href=\"#content100note1sym\">[\u00a01\u00a0]</a> Rather, we encountered something particular about philosophy or economics or psychology or what have you, something that we found deeply appealing, that fascinated or stymied or moved us, that activated our minds and released our energies. We are not used to thinking of bafflement or amazement as virtues. Indeed, typically they are not\u2014they are attitudes or experiences, not stable dispositions. But there is no reason that we can\u2019t speak of a stable disposition to be baffled or amazed in ways that are perfective of action and character, and this would be virtuous bafflement or virtuous amazement.</p>\n<p>We happened, then, upon goods internal to the practice of a particular academic discipline, and these goods drew us in much as a virtuous exemplar draws us in, exciting our admiration and emulation. And, truth be told, in many instances it was through a virtuous exemplar of the discipline that we first came alive to its charms. We wanted not just to grasp those thoughts, or that style of thinking, but we wanted to be like that person, made more vibrantly alive through their grasp of these distinctive internal goods. <a href=\"https://globalfacultyinitiative.net/content_item/462\">Oliver O\u2019Donovan</a>\u2019s observation about the ways in which talk of the virtues focuses our attention on admirable others offers a helpful response to those who worry that virtue ethics encourages preoccupation with oneself and one\u2019s own character: \u201cwhen we talk about virtues, we disengage ourselves from our own preoccupations with acting and seek to \u2018distinguish what is excellent\u2019 as seen in the lives of others.\u201d</p>\n<p>Augustine explored this dynamic in a particularly powerful way. The acquisition of the virtues, he argued, is not merely a matter of training via repetition, habituation into certain patterns of action. It requires a transformation of the heart and will, an ordering of our loves to genuine goods and ultimately to God, Goodness itself. This takes place insofar as God reveals Godself, God\u2019s supreme beauty, to us. And this transformation can be mediated through the lives of others and even through texts. One of Augustine\u2019s favorite examples is of the power of a narrative, the <em>Life of Antony</em>. He relates a story told by Ponticianus of an imperial agent who, happening upon a copy of the <em>Life of Antony</em>, \u201cbegan to read it, marvelled at it, was inflamed by it,\u201d inspired to devote his life to seeking friendship with God.<a class=\"anchor\" id=\"content100note2anc\" name=\"content100note2anc\">\u00a0</a><a class=\"note\" href=\"#content100note2sym\">[\u00a02\u00a0]</a></p>\n<p>Something of this dynamic is at work in the kind of transformation involved in the development of any virtue, as it involves the way we perceive and feel as well as judge. Reconnecting with this living water, the attractions of wealth and prestige fade. A critical first step is to reconnect with whatever has mediated for us this disclosure of the Good. From this flows the power to resist careerism and to begin to cultivate the array of virtues to which respondents so eloquently point.</p>\n<h2>Can Institutions Display Virtues and Vices?</h2>\n<p>Reflection on the ways in which educational institutions facilitate the cultivation of various vices and virtues leads us to a question posed by both <a href=\"https://globalfacultyinitiative.net/content_item/347\">Terence Halliday</a> and <a href=\"https://globalfacultyinitiative.net/content_item/345\">Donald Hay</a>: can we speak of organizations or institutions as having virtues and vices, as being more or less just, temperate, or prudent? <a href=\"https://globalfacultyinitiative.net/content_item/343\">Chris Marshall</a>, meanwhile, speaks unhesitatingly of \u201cinstitutional character.\u201d</p>\n<h3><strong>We Can Speak Analogously</strong></h3>\n<p>In my Preview on the virtues, I suggested that institutions form character and in turn are formed by the character of the people who constitute them. In the Brief itself, I expand on the critical role that social practices, communities, and institutions play (or fail to play) in enabling persons to develop and sustain the virtues. Strictly speaking, virtues cannot be attributed to institutions. This is because virtues, strictly speaking, are dispositions of individual persons, stable tendencies to feel, perceive, respond, judge, and act in good ways, perfective of the agent and of the common good. I do suggest, however, that \u201cwe can speak analogously of virtuous institutions when their organizing principles and daily practices are such as to support the virtues of those who inhabit them.\u201d</p>\n<p><a href=\"https://globalfacultyinitiative.net/content_item/462\">Oliver O\u2019Donovan</a>, in his response, shows that this approach can be taken further: \u201cwe refer intelligibly... to the \u2018virtues\u2019 of institutions, for though this use of the term is an analogy it is a perfectly valid one. Institutions resemble human agents in embodying a consciousness of some good and a purpose of realizing it.\u201d This is helpful. Aristotle emphasized that the virtuous agent does not merely habitually perform good acts, but chooses their actions deliberately and voluntarily, precisely in order to act well. As O\u2019Donovan notes, institutions can articulate the ends they seek (for instance, in mission statements) and work to ensure that their policies and practices align with these ends. An institution that is organized solely around the maximization of profit is dramatically different from one that seeks to enable a decent life for all its employees, offering products that enhance the lives of those who purchase them and creating a work environment that honors the dignity of all of those touched by the company. We can certainly\u2014and quite profitably\u2014speak of the virtues of such an organization, characterizing it as just and practically wise, perhaps even generous. On the contrary, a company that seeks only to maximize shareholder value, allowing that end to justify any means available, is bound to be deeply vicious, even if its practices remain within the bounds of legality. It will be likely to exploit and overwork its employees, manipulate and deceive customers, and yield products of little value. Nonprofit organizations exist to provide a public good or social benefit, with the requirement that revenues must be directed to the organization\u2019s purpose, so it is easier for a nonprofit organization to resist being derailed by the pursuit of external goods. Yet as we see in the case of universities, for instance, this is no guarantee of institutional virtue. Many universities allow prestige, \u201crankings,\u201d to shoulder out commitment to the substantive internal goods of knowledge and creative inquiry for which they were created. For-profit and nonprofit organizations alike can become vitiated despite the articulation of lofty purposes, when their internal workings are not effectively aligned with these purposes. An institutional culture of backbiting and cutthroat competition can render a workplace inimical to human flourishing, regardless of any lofty mission statements. With institutions as with individuals, certain virtues can exist alongside other vices, but any institutional vice serves to vitiate the whole.</p>\n<p><a href=\"https://globalfacultyinitiative.net/content_item/1084\">Terence Halliday</a>, in his Disciplinary Brief on \u201cCourage and Prudence in China\u2019s Human Rights Struggles,\u201d offers a powerful example of the virtues and vices not just of institutions, but also of more loosely organized communities, such as the community of human rights lawyers in China, who band together in ways that support collective discernment and sustain commitment to justice in the face of a host of threats and active persecution. We cannot make sense of the extraordinary courage displayed by these human rights lawyers without attending to the way in which community here serves as a \u201ccarrier\u201d of the virtues of courage and prudence.</p>\n<h3>Can virtuous individuals exist within vicious organizations?</h3>\n<p>Yes, to be sure, but they will chafe at the institutional context in which they find themselves. <a href=\"https://globalfacultyinitiative.net/content_item/343\">Chris Marshall</a> notes (pointing to the criminal justice system as an example) that it seems at times that complex institutional forces are at work that seem to defeat the good intentions of individuals at work within them, and this is certainly true. Such individuals can work towards the transformation of institutional character by seeking to articulate genuine goods towards which the institutions can or ought to be oriented, by identifying policies and practices that disproportionately elevate external goods, and by seeking to foster just and caring institutional cultures. The kind of contribution that an individual can make to improving institutional character is constrained by the role of the individual within the institution. Some workers have little influence on organizational policies and practices, while others have immense power for transformation.</p>\n<p><a href=\"https://globalfacultyinitiative.net/content_item/350\">Karen Kong</a> makes an important point in this connection: Christians might in some contexts \u201cface the choice of whether to continue to stay on to practice virtues against institutions or political pressure at a high cost and a risk of their own fallenness and stifling, or to sever from those institutions and authorities and find a more nurturing place that enable them to better promote human flourishing.\u201d As <a href=\"https://globalfacultyinitiative.net/content_item/1084\">Terence Halliday</a> and <a href=\"https://globalfacultyinitiative.net/content_item/341\">Karen Man Yee Lee</a> also point out, standing up against authoritarian regimes can require great courage and involve intense suffering. How might a decision of this kind be made well? Implicit in Kong\u2019s articulation of the situation are some of the relevant considerations. Does remaining within the institution bring with it meaningful opportunities to transform it towards justice? Does the individual have the skills and virtues necessary to enact such a transformation, or are they likely only to be broken by the experience? Do others exist with whom common action could be undertaken? Does the individual have special obligations towards particular others who would be deeply affected by the decision to remain or to sever institutional ties? I know persons who have left the academy, or a particular institution, for reasons of conscience, believing that they were not capable of transforming existing structures. Some are whole and at peace; others broken and bitter. It takes the virtue of practical wisdom to reflect well on how to respond to such challenging situations, and the virtue of courage to make and follow through on a difficult and costly decision. Self-knowledge, too, is key: one who thinks they have greater courage and perseverance and practical wisdom than they in fact possess is likely to attempt something of which they are not capable.</p>\n<p><a href=\"https://globalfacultyinitiative.net/content_item/350\">Kong</a> asks how Christians might be supported in decision-making processes of this kind. For starters, we do well to reflect on the kind of support that fellow Christians and church communities, can play in situations like this.<sup>\u00a0</sup><a class=\"anchor\" id=\"content100note3anc\" name=\"content100note3anc\"> </a><a class=\"note\" href=\"#content100note3sym\">[\u00a03\u00a0]</a> It need not be a matter of a single virtuous individual arrayed against the power of a corrupt institution, where there is community and institutional power of a very different kind supporting that individual. <a href=\"https://globalfacultyinitiative.net/content_item/1084\">Terence Halliday</a> makes this point very powerfully in his reflections on human rights lawyers in China. Christian faith that human virtue is in need of divine grace for its perfection goes hand in hand with a recognition of virtue\u2019s fundamentally frail and dependent character. Empirical studies have suggested that virtues are often highly local and context dependent, acquiring whatever stability they have by way of stability in social situation.<a class=\"anchor\" id=\"content100note4anc\" name=\"content100note4anc\">\u00a0</a><a class=\"note\" href=\"#content100note4sym\">[\u00a04\u00a0]</a> (This relates to the important point about relational selfhood, and the co-dependency of individuals in community, made by <a href=\"https://globalfacultyinitiative.net/content_item/363\">Manuel Morales</a> in his Preview Response.) If the virtues are typically socially dependent, it underscores the potential significance of Christian churches and their many liturgical and paraliturgical practices as offering robust social support for the cultivation of the virtues. Research on meditation and compassion suggests that those who regularly call to mind the needs of others, dwell on their common humanity, idealize caring responses to the marginalized and disempowered, in the context of communities that prize and practice these same forms of attention and responsiveness, become more likely to develop robust dispositions of compassion and generosity.<a class=\"anchor\" id=\"content100note5anc\" name=\"content100note5anc\">\u00a0</a><a class=\"note\" href=\"#content100note5sym\">[\u00a05\u00a0]</a> The flip side of the confession of virtue\u2019s fragile and dependent character is confidence in the power of divine grace, working through the life of the church, to strengthen all-too-human virtues. This does not mean that every Christian should remain within a corrupt institution to work for its transformation; the wise and courageous action may be to leave, if that is an option, rather than stay.</p>\n<h2>Economics and the Virtues in Markets and Commerce</h2>\n<p>Above, I noted the ways in which a narrow focus on the maximization of profit or shareholder value vitiates the character of for-profit companies. Several respondents had important observations to make that relate to this point. As <a href=\"https://globalfacultyinitiative.net/content_item/1064\">Susan Thorp</a> notes, the principle of maximizing shareholder value \u201cconveniently offers an \u2018escape clause\u2019 for corporations\u2019 choices that neglect virtue and damage people, exploit the environment and degrade community and institutions.\u201d Ever since Adam Smith, the notion of the invisible hand has been invoked to legitimate self-interested economic behavior as facilitating the efficient workings of markets. Bernard Mandeville argued that private vices gave rise to public benefits. Smith, however, was quite aware that reliance on the invisible hand would not give rise to a decent society, and that efficient markets do not guarantee equity.<a class=\"anchor\" id=\"content100note6anc\" name=\"content100note6anc\">\u00a0</a><a class=\"note\" href=\"#content100note6sym\">[\u00a06\u00a0]</a> Much of the discipline of economics is directed at the analysis of unintended consequences of human action that arise through large scale patterns of interaction. The virtues, in contrast, have to do with intentional action; virtuous agent acts in ways they know to be good precisely because they grasp the goodness of so acting. Bringing these two ways of thinking about human action together in ways that serve the common good has proven to be no easy task.</p>\n<p><a href=\"https://globalfacultyinitiative.net/content_item/1064\">Susan Thorp</a> points out that the mathematical models of financial economics need not assume that economic actors are purely self-interested. If I derive greater satisfaction from drinking coffee produced under fair trade conditions than from coffee not subject to such constraints, this can be captured in my utility function. These models can be useful for description and prediction. At a deeper level, however, these models encourage a kind of homogenizing in which all action is seen as aimed at maximizing utility. And this may have the perverse effect of encouraging self-interest by legitimizing an approach to life conceived in terms of maximizing one\u2019s own utility.</p>\n<p>The analysis of human behavior in terms of incentives can also have the insidious effect of encouraging a view of human persons as manipulable targets of social engineering rather than as active reflective agents of their own lives. In his Preview Response, <a href=\"https://globalfacultyinitiative.net/content_item/345\">Donald Hay</a> draws attention to literature suggesting \u201cthat the emphasis on incentives in the standard presentations of economic behaviour in economics departments and business schools has eroded the virtuous character of a new generation of economic actors involved in running corporations.\u201d While I argued that universities should avoid creating perverse incentive structures that reward cutthroat careerism, I agree with Samuel Bowles (2016) that \u201cgood incentives are no substitutes for good citizens.\u201d</p>\n<p><a href=\"https://globalfacultyinitiative.net/content_item/345\">Gordon Menzies and Donald Hay</a> offer a richly developed Disciplinary Brief on Economics and the Virtues that rewards careful reading. As they note, there are literatures reaching back to the 18<sup>th</sup> century that explore the question of how markets and commerce shape character, with advocates of \u201cdoux commerce\u201d arguing that commercial exchanges foster a host of virtues from honesty and reliability to friendliness and helpfulness, while their opponents worried that market exchanges foster selfishness and crowd out virtues nurtured in the family, churches, and other civil society institutions. I find persuasive their nuanced conclusion that \u201cthe \u2018self-destruction\u2019 effect in market economies is likely to be widespread in economic behavior, and that the more optimistic doux commerce effect is present, but is probably not robust unless sustained by a moral framework imported from outside the market.\u201d Inasmuch as market incentives now permeate all corners of society, this is a matter of grave concern. The cultivation of the virtues requires social contexts in which agents learn to value and engage in practices for the sake of intrinsic rather than extrinsic goods. We might for starters think here of children who learn that helping out around the house is a way of participating in the loving community of the family, not something they can do if they want to earn pocket change but otherwise can leave to others. I am reminded of a recent interview in the New York Times with Robert Putnam, whose study of the erosion of civil society institutions in <em>Bowling Alone</em> offered such a penetrating analysis of American society.<a class=\"anchor\" id=\"content100note7anc\" name=\"content100note7anc\">\u00a0</a><a class=\"note\" href=\"#content100note7sym\">[\u00a07\u00a0]</a> \u201cWe\u2019re not going to fix polarization, inequality, social isolation until, first of all, we start feeling we have an obligation to care for other people,\u201d notes Putnam.<a class=\"anchor\" id=\"content100note8anc\" name=\"content100note8anc\">\u00a0</a><a class=\"note\" href=\"#content100note8sym\">[\u00a08\u00a0]</a> I would add that we need not merely a feeling of obligation to care but actual caring for others. Learning to care is bound up with the cultivation of the virtues and requires contexts in which we see and feel how beautiful, how attractive, is a life of such loving care. Christians encounter this beauty in Jesus Christ, and churches have the capacity (whether or not always realized) to embody it day by day.</p>\n<h2>Do Digital Technologies Enhance or Subvert the Virtues?</h2>\n<p><a href=\"https://globalfacultyinitiative.net/content_item/360\">Priscila Viera</a> poses critically important questions concerning digital technologies: are these technologies neutral with respect to the virtues? Can we neatly detach the medium from the message? Are phenomena like social exclusion, individualism, and the fostering of extremism inevitable results of certain technologies, or could the same media also generate community and compassion? These are poignant questions, given the great enthusiasm that greeted the birth of the internet, with many hailing it as an unprecedented boon for global connection and democracy. Now, three decades later, we are more aware of the destructive outworkings of these technologies. The human drive for social connection is easily manipulable, and algorithms designed to maximize profits for Facebook and Google feed polarization, echo chambers, and flash-in-the-pan virality over kindness, truth, and boundary-crossing love. This does not mean that digital technologies generally, or social media in particular, inevitably feed the vices. It does highlight the moral dangers of allowing the drive to maximize profits to operate without constraints.</p>\n<p><a href=\"https://globalfacultyinitiative.net/content_item/1066\">Jocelyn Downey, Victor Li, and Jacqueline Lam</a> raise a related set of questions in their response to the Brief, \u201cVirtue Ethics and Development of an Ethical AI for Social Good.\u201d There is intense attention at present to the need to develop a so-called \u201cethical AI,\u201d given the increasing autonomy of digital systems ranging from self-driving cars to weapons systems capable of making \u201cdecisions\u201d without human intervention. Might a virtue ethical approach be helpful here, they ask? And might \u201cnature itself facilitate development of a bottom-up ethical framework when trained on big data taken across diverse languages and cultures?\u201d This is a fascinating question, given Christian faith that the world, as highlighted by theologian <a href=\"https://globalfacultyinitiative.net/content_item/218\">Nigel Biggar</a> in his Brief on \u201cCreated Order,\u201d is the creation of a rational Creator and thus evinces a created order. Might that order come into view as AI systems capable of analyzing vast quantities of data discern patterns indiscernible by human intelligence? Just this has been suggested by theologian Jordan Joseph Wales, who argues that a neural network can begin \u201cto resonate with the entangled relations implicit in our world, including relations not easily discerned or logically represented by human investigators.\u201d A neural network is \u201creceptive to, imprinted by the structure of the world as presented to it.\u201d<a class=\"anchor\" id=\"content100note9anc\" name=\"content100note9anc\">\u00a0</a><a class=\"note\" href=\"#content100note9sym\">[\u00a09\u00a0]</a> The problem with using such methods to try to drive a bottom-up development of ethical AI, and in particular to develop a kind of common morality in the midst of global ethical diversity, is that the patterns discerned by neural networks will be the patterns of a fallen creation. As Downey, Li, and Lam note, \u201cAI should carefully avoid being misguided by the inherent order exhibited by data, which may likely reflect the worldviews and behaviours of the sinful as well as Christian virtues.\u201d<a class=\"anchor\" id=\"content100note10anc\" name=\"content100note10anc\">\u00a0</a><a class=\"note\" href=\"#content100note10sym\">[\u00a010\u00a0]</a></p>\n<p><a href=\"https://globalfacultyinitiative.net/content_item/1066\">Downey, Li, and Lam</a> highlight some of the challenges that attend the attempt to imbue AI systems with the virtues, noting that \u201cif an AI is trained to adjust its behaviour according to the virtues of beneficence, non-maleficence, justice, and explicability, in each case a judgment is needed through trained data provided with given rules, as to whether a behaviour is beneficent, just, maleficent, or explicable.\u201d They therefore suggest a hybrid approach in which virtues are constrained by rules. These are valuable observations. A common approach of data ethicists involves articulating a list of principles that AI systems should honor in order to be ethical. Beneficence, non-maleficence, justice, and explicability are often on the lists (reflecting the influence of the principlist approach to medical ethics developed by Beauchamp and Childress).<a class=\"anchor\" id=\"content100note11anc\" name=\"content100note11anc\">\u00a0</a><a class=\"note\" href=\"#content100note11sym\">[\u00a011\u00a0]</a> It is helpful to note the difference between principles and virtues. In medicine, the principle of benevolence expresses the commitment to the importance of medical treatment that actually benefits the patient. Principles must be specified and balanced in relation to other principles; they are not immediately action-guiding. A virtue is a stable disposition to respond well in response to salient considerations in some particular domain. It is possible to endorse the principle of benevolence, and to strive to embed that principle in various systems, while lacking the virtues of love and kindness. One might, for instance, work to ensure that an AI system is benevolent solely in order to protect the public reputation of the company that created it.</p>\n<p><a href=\"https://globalfacultyinitiative.net/content_item/1066\">Downey, Li, and Lam</a> propose a hybrid approach in which \u201cvirtues are constrained by a series of hard consequences or rules.\u201d Substituting \u201cprinciples\u201d in place of \u201cvirtues\u201d here, I agree that principles must be specified through rules, for instance, in training self-driving cars. But there is an additional complication here. Rules must be applied to situations, and the virtues are needed in order to apply rules wisely. Regardless of how specific the rule, situations will always arise in which there is ambiguity and lack of precedent. Are we prepared to offload responsibility for such judgments to autonomous systems that function as black boxes and that cannot be held responsible? Or does the ineliminability of wise judgment mean that human beings must always be kept in the loop and autonomous machine intelligence kept at bay?</p>\n<h2>What is the Role of Law in Relation to the Virtues?</h2>\n<p>These reflections on the critical importance of judgment lead nicely into responses from the area of law. <a href=\"https://globalfacultyinitiative.net/content_item/350\">Karen Kong</a> notes that the presence of discretionary powers in law means that virtues will always be required. And <a href=\"https://globalfacultyinitiative.net/content_item/364\">Nicholas Aroney</a>, emphasizes that \u201cprudent governance will not consist simply in the multiplication of rules in order to secure good conduct. The particular situations to which rules must be applied are too contingent and complex for a discrete set of rules, no matter how sophisticated and comprehensive, to provide sufficient guidance for good conduct in every situation.\u201d Instead of multiplying legislation, we need greater support for civil society organizations that help to form the virtues in their participants. Like Putnam (and other distinguished thinkers, notably Jacques Maritain), Aroney regards these institutions as the key to forming persons of good character. I agree. I am not confident, though, that greater government support of civil society institutions will in and of itself bring people back into the pews. We may need more Spirit-led innovation within these institutions (and notably within the churches) in order to respond effectively to the major cultural shifts that have led to decline.</p>\n<p><a href=\"https://globalfacultyinitiative.net/content_item/461\">Anna High</a> offers a nuanced set of reflections on the capacity of a legal system to facilitate or hinder the development of virtues among those governed by it. Certainly we can see how law evolves in response to changing societal norms. For instance, as High notes, the legal understanding of rape now reflects greater regard for human dignity. In the United States, for instance, more states now define rape by reference to lack of consent rather than by reference to the presence of coercion. Indeed, some states define rape by reference to the lack of affirmative consent. High raises important questions about the permissibility of using law as a tool to effect changes in societal norms. Would it be appropriate, for instance, legally to require affirmative consent in a jurisdiction in which this would mean that ubiquitous and previously permissible sexual activity would become criminal? I am a bit hesitant on this score. Where a broad-based social consensus exists, law can be a tool for ethical formation. In the absence of such consensus, I doubt that law can serve as an effective tool for this purpose. Legislating high ideals can be counterproductive, eliciting disrespect for the law. This argument goes back to Thomas Aquinas, who argued that law should be framed for the many, who are far from perfect in character. It should be aimed at more severe forms of viciousness from which the majority are capable of abstaining. If the law sought to legislate perfection, people would become hostile to the law and this would defeat its purpose: \u201cthe purpose of human law is to lead men to virtue, not suddenly, but gradually. Wherefore it does not lay upon the multitude of imperfect men the burdens of those who are already virtuous, viz., that they should abstain from all evil. Otherwise these imperfect ones, being unable to bear such precepts, would break out into yet greater evils.\u201d<a class=\"anchor\" id=\"content100note12anc\" name=\"content100note12anc\">\u00a0</a><a class=\"note\" href=\"#content100note12sym\">[\u00a012\u00a0]</a></p>\n<h2>Epistemic Virtue and Vice</h2>\n<p>A cluster of respondents highlight epistemic virtues and vices, that is, virtues and vices related to beliefs, their acquisition and revision. Epistemic virtues assist their possessors in arriving at the truth. They also govern discursive exchanges, how we engage with others, in our pursuit of truth. <a href=\"https://globalfacultyinitiative.net/content_item/339\">Michael Spence</a> notes that epistemic virtues for the conduct of effective discourse are of particular importance in the context of universities. <a href=\"https://globalfacultyinitiative.net/content_item/359\">Allan Bell</a>, coming from the perspective of sociolinguistics, highlights the virtues of speaking and listening. <a href=\"https://globalfacultyinitiative.net/content_item/349\">John Inazu</a> raises concerns about the ways in which the meanings of key ethical concepts, like \u201cequality\u201d and \u201cjustice,\u201d are often distorted, with the loudest or most influential voices able not merely to capture attention, but to reshape collective perception and judgment. <a href=\"https://globalfacultyinitiative.net/content_item/354\">Daniel Hastings</a>, meanwhile, asks how we are to respond to the challenges that surround the post-truth phenomenon, in which basic facts are disputed and lies accepted as truth no matter the evidence.</p>\n<p>These issues have received considerable attention in recent years within so-called \u201cvice epistemology.\u201d Quassim Hassan, for instance, has studied the epistemic vices of \u201cclosed-mindedness, intellectual arrogance, wishful thinking, and prejudice,\u201d analyzing what makes them resistant to change and how we can begin to transform them.<a class=\"anchor\" id=\"content100note13anc\" name=\"content100note13anc\">\u00a0</a><a class=\"note\" href=\"#content100note13sym\">[\u00a013\u00a0]</a> Miranda Fricker has analyzed epistemic injustice, in which persons are injured specifically in their capacity as knowers, their voices systematically discounted because of their membership in some subordinated group. Fricker proposes virtues of epistemic justice that can begin to remedy these injustices and correct these vices.<a class=\"anchor\" id=\"content100note14anc\" name=\"content100note14anc\">\u00a0</a><a class=\"note\" href=\"#content100note14sym\">[\u00a014\u00a0]</a></p>\n<p>Clearly there is an urgent need for better education that assists persons in evaluating the reliability of sources and helps them understand, for instance, the fact that social media algorithms are designed to boost engagement, not to track truth. It is also important to study and make widely known the ways in which human beings tend to form in-groups and out-groups and systematically discount the perspectives of members of out-groups.<a class=\"anchor\" id=\"content100note15anc\" name=\"content100note15anc\">\u00a0</a><a class=\"note\" href=\"#content100note15sym\">[\u00a015\u00a0]</a> A major challenge is the erosion of social trust within highly polarized societies. This is a self-reinforcing process in which distrust breeds polarization and polarization exacerbates distrust. In the face of ingrained distrust, education cannot get off the ground. Rebuilding trust is no easy matter and likely requires face-to-face engagement in activities that are not politically freighted, to return again to Robert Putnam\u2019s insights.<a class=\"anchor\" id=\"content100note16anc\" name=\"content100note16anc\">\u00a0</a><a class=\"note\" href=\"#content100note16sym\">[\u00a016\u00a0]</a> With the institutions of civil society eroding, from churches to bowling leagues, it is not clear where this kind of engagement will take place. I have argued for the importance of understanding how groups that perceive their social influence eroding are tempted to engage in partisan epistemology. Sadly, this includes Christian faith communities, which are often tempted to engage in epistemic insulation as a protective mechanism. Jesus facing Pilate offers an alternative model: disruptive engagement with a post-truth dominator. Jesus resists epistemic injustice and opens space for the building of unbounded communities of trust and shared understanding.<a class=\"anchor\" id=\"content100note17anc\" name=\"content100note17anc\">\u00a0</a><a class=\"note\" href=\"#content100note17sym\">[\u00a017\u00a0]</a></p>\n<h2>Reckoning with Complexity and Avoiding the Vices of Moralism</h2>\n<p>In the 19<sup>th</sup> century, \u201cmoralism\u201d referred to social movements to spread certain ethical commitments throughout society: the abolitionist and temperance movements are perhaps the best examples. Looking back, we may look rather quizzically at the latter, even as we admire the former as belated but nonetheless courageous and imperative. Over time, however, moralism itself has acquired negative connotations, no longer referring simply to the promotion of social causes on moral grounds, but to being too quick to issue moral judgements concerning others, or too quick to claim moral authority for oneself.</p>\n<p>One good reason to be hesitant concerning moralizing social movements is that they often simplify a complex social reality. <a href=\"https://globalfacultyinitiative.net/content_item/1068\">David Mahan</a> makes a compelling case both for \u201cthe moral urgency of ambiguity\u201d and for the importance of literature for assisting us to grasp both this ambiguity and its urgency. Literature activates our imaginations and exerts a strong affective pull. We are attracted (or repelled) by whole characters: we find ourselves wanting to be \u201clike that\u201d even where we cannot fully articulate just what it is that we find so attractive. Literature can wake us up, instill a sense of moral urgency, a sense that it matters, deeply, how we respond to what life hands us, and what sort of person we become. Mahan offers us rich examples. This is all music to my ears, and a theme I have myself explored elsewhere.<sup>\u00a0</sup><a class=\"anchor\" id=\"content100note18anc\" name=\"content100note18anc\"> </a><a class=\"note\" href=\"#content100note18sym\">[\u00a018\u00a0]</a> It is worth noting that literature, so understood, can be moralizing without being moralistic, that is, without issuing judgments on others or claiming undue authority; Mahan points to T.S. Eliot\u2019s call for \u201ccriticism from a definite ethical and theological standpoint,\u201d which was compatible with a dislike for preachiness.<a class=\"anchor\" id=\"content100note19anc\" name=\"content100note19anc\">\u00a0</a><a class=\"note\" href=\"#content100note19sym\">[\u00a019\u00a0]</a> One concern we might have about contemporary late modern societies is that they are characterized by a certain sort of incoherence: on the one hand, there is an intense dislike of exposure to the moral judgments of those with whom we disagree, while on the other hand, there is nevertheless a tendency to pronounce moral judgments on others within the safety of echo-chambers of the like-minded, or into the internet ether, in which no actual exchange is taking place. It is worth knowing that literature is \u201cslow,\u201d social media is \u201cfast\u201d; we need more social spaces today for decelerated reflection and judgment, spaces that allow for complexity and nuance.</p>\n<p>I admire the work that <a href=\"https://globalfacultyinitiative.net/content_item/463\">John Peteet</a> is doing to reintroduce the virtues into the arena of mental health. In the context of a therapeutic society, this has doubtless been an uphill battle (as for Tyler VanderWeele in the field of public health). Having considered the significance of virtues of self-control, benevolence, intelligence and positivity for clinical work, he is just getting started, and is now turning to incorporate a virtues-based perspective into diagnostic assessment, goal-setting, and treatment. \u201cClinicians typically eschew the term \u2018vice\u2019 as moralistic,\u201d he notes, \u201cbut maladaptive personality traits or disorders reflect perhaps the most obvious example of a need for virtues.\u201d Doubtless talk of character strengths and vulnerabilities can gain an easier hearing than talk of vices or even of virtues. This is not necessarily a problem; choosing a vocabulary capable of gaining a hearing can be crucial, and the connotations of both \u201cvice\u201d and \u201cvirtue\u201d can close ears and hearts. What is critical, as Peteet recognizes, is that whatever language we use empower the agency of patients.<a class=\"anchor\" id=\"content100note20anc\" name=\"content100note20anc\">\u00a0</a><a class=\"note\" href=\"#content100note20sym\">[\u00a020\u00a0]</a> Exclusive use of the paradigm of illness fosters passivity. The patient\u2019s sense of their own agency in the process of moving towards flourishing must be activated. This involves coming to see one\u2019s cares and emotions and motives and attitudes as one\u2019s own even if not freely chosen, as woven into the selfhood with which one reflects and acts, even one can also take up a stand against some of these emotions and motives and seek their transformation.<a class=\"anchor\" id=\"content100note21anc\" name=\"content100note21anc\">\u00a0</a><a class=\"note\" href=\"#content100note21sym\">[\u00a021\u00a0]</a> This is a complex process in which, as Peteet notes, the wise therapist can play a valuable role. There is surely nothing moralistic here.</p>\n<p><a href=\"https://globalfacultyinitiative.net/content_item/1073\">Alana Moore</a>\u2019s poignant observations about \u201cVirtue Ethics vs. Virtue Signalling in the Global Humanitarian System\u201d touch on some related concerns. Recipients of aid, like patients engaged in therapy, are placed in positions of passivity and thus in danger of having their agency be undermined. \u201cThere must be opportunity for the participants,\u201d Moore suggests, \u201cto grasp for themselves what is good and wise and honest, and to desire to be the kind of person who is defined by such attributes.\u201d Virtuous aid workers, meanwhile, are committed to \u201cthe mutual building up of equals in dignity and worth through the world they seek to bring into being together.\u201d The worry that aid workers will be more preoccupied with their own goodness than with the preciousness of those who suffer, and the claims they make on others, is a real one; virtue signalling is indeed a vice, and one particularly endemic to humanitarian institutions. This does not mean, however, that the powerful and the vulnerable are not alike in need of virtues, and in particular \u201cthe overarching virtue of love to bind giver and receiver.\u201d Our worries about moralism and virtue signalling must not be allowed to erode our capacity to name such truths.</p>\n<h2>Virtue and Flourishing beyond the Therapeutic Mindset</h2>\n<p>Tyler VanderWeele, Brendan Case, and Karen Man Yee Lee all take up the question of the relation of virtue to flourishing. VanderWeele and Case note empirical evidence for positive relationships between moral character and flourishing. <a href=\"https://globalfacultyinitiative.net/content_item/348\">Case</a> points to a study by Harvard\u2019s Human Flourishing Program that found that \u201ceven the self-assessed \u2018commitment to promoting the good in all circumstances\u2019 is highly predictive of future flourishing in many domains, including social relationships, life satisfaction, and even physical health.\u201d <a href=\"https://globalfacultyinitiative.net/content_item/1070\">Vanderweele</a> refers to a multitude of studies showing that character-based interventions that promote gratitude, kindness, forgiveness, compassion, patience, and perseverance also have positive effects on happiness, sleep, physical health, depression and anxiety, and educational test scores. At the same time, Vanderweele notes that \u201cgood character, or virtue, is of course not only instrumentally valuable, but intrinsically important in its own right.\u201d Virtue is constitutive of flourishing, not merely instrumental to flourishing. This is a critically important point. And it is helpful to distinguish different kinds of flourishing. It is possible to sleep well, have good physical health, high test scores, and be free of depression and anxiety without having the virtues, even if having the virtues can under certain circumstances conduce to these forms of well-being. It is not possible to flourish <em>tout court</em>, <em>as a human being</em>, however, without the virtues. The virtues perfect our agency and responsiveness to the good such that we respond well regardless of the situations in which we find ourselves.</p>\n<p>This is important for absorbing the force of the observations made by <a href=\"https://globalfacultyinitiative.net/content_item/341\">Karen Man Yee Lee</a> and <a href=\"https://globalfacultyinitiative.net/content_item/1084\">Terence Halliday</a>, who point to the virtues of courage and justice that can strengthen persons risking liberty and livelihood in the face of authoritarian regimes. Here the virtues equip persons to act well in highly difficult situations. At the same time, the exercise of the virtues of courage and justice here can issue in \u201cenormous human suffering.\u201d What are we to say about the connection between virtue and flourishing here? It might seem that having the virtues in this context positively detracts from flourishing; the courageous protester ends up in prison, say, while the ordinary compliant citizen remains free to sleep at home in their beds, receiving quality health care and sending their children to excellent schools.</p>\n<p>I have argued that we need to put this differently.<a class=\"anchor\" id=\"content100note22anc\" name=\"content100note22anc\">\u00a0</a><a class=\"note\" href=\"#content100note22sym\">[\u00a022\u00a0]</a> The life of the virtues can certainly be accompanied by great suffering. The virtues never, though, detract from flourishing. The virtues equip persons to flourish as fully as possible under the circumstances they confront. We should not be surprised that the virtues are ordinarily conducive to having good physical and mental health, for the virtues bring harmony among our desires, emotions, and judgments and form us such that we find it intrinsically pleasant to act well. We do not always find ourselves in ordinary circumstances, however. We may continue to take satisfaction in acting well in the face of a murderous regime; this does not mean that we enjoy the violations we suffer under such a regime. To the Stoic who insists that the sage is happy even when tortured on the rack, I say that the sage is as happy as it is possible to be given those circumstances, since the sage (by definition one perfect in virtue) responds perfectly to the situation and all the various goods at stake in that situation. Responding differently (say, by betraying the cause and escaping torture) would only make the sage more miserable. The virtuous may have to relinquish worthy projects made impossible by circumstances; at an extreme, they may have to give up their lives. As <a href=\"https://globalfacultyinitiative.net/content_item/462\">Oliver O\u2019Donovan</a> wisely notes, \u201csometimes ideals formed by admiration of a worthy object and admirable in themselves may still not be the right guide to the circumstances in which God has placed us.\u201d Christians should not be surprised to hear that perfect happiness is found only in the eschaton.</p>\n<h2>Grace, the Virtues, and Friendship with God</h2>\n<p><a href=\"https://globalfacultyinitiative.net/content_item/460\">Christopher Hayes</a> and <a href=\"https://globalfacultyinitiative.net/content_item/1063\">K.K. Yeo</a> offer rich reflections on the ways in which the cultivation of the virtues can be furthered through intercultural and interreligious exchange. Encounters with those from other traditions makes us aware of both commonalities and local peculiarities. Such encounters can be mutually enriching and transformative. My understanding of the virtues as both acquired and infused, and of the Holy Spirit as unbounded by human cultures and institutions, is hospitable to these encounters. We are called to friendship with God, and friendship involves the free and knowing embrace of intimacy with the friend. That the virtues are ultimately perfected by this friendship does not mean that those who do not seek friendship with God have no virtues, or that Christians have nothing to learn from them.<a class=\"anchor\" id=\"content100note23anc\" name=\"content100note23anc\">\u00a0</a><a class=\"note\" href=\"#content100note23sym\">[\u00a023\u00a0]</a></p>\n<p><a href=\"https://globalfacultyinitiative.net/content_item/462\">Oliver O\u2019Donovan</a> points to the fact that the Greek Church Fathers regarded love not as a virtue but as an operation of the Holy Spirit, pointing to the insufficiency of virtue and to our dependence on grace.<a class=\"anchor\" id=\"content100note24anc\" name=\"content100note24anc\">\u00a0</a><a class=\"note\" href=\"#content100note24sym\">[\u00a024\u00a0]</a> Thomas Aquinas took a different route to a similar end, affirming love\u2019s standing among the virtues but regarding the gifts of the Holy Spirit as additional habits or dispositions that perfect the theological and cardinal virtues by rendering their possessor receptive to the workings of the Holy Spirit. There is a shared affirmation here of the need for a grace that, in O\u2019Donovan\u2019s words, \u201callows our various dispositions and powers to come together to serve God\u2019s purposes effectively.\u201d Our personal resources, however well-developed, do not suffice to fit us for friendship with God. They are perfected as we are opened up to, and learn to rely on, the power of grace in our lives. This is a lesson that any experience of love begins to teach us, but that faith teaches us to begin to name.</p>\n<h2 class=\"new_page\">End Notes</h2>\n<p class=\"endnote\"><a class=\"note\" href=\"#content100note1anc\">[\u00a01\u00a0]</a><a class=\"anchor\" id=\"content100note1sym\" name=\"content100note1sym\">\u00a0</a> On external vs. internal goods, see Alasdair MacIntyre, <em>After Virtue</em> (Notre Dame: University of Notre Dame Press, 1981), 187\u2013192.</p>\n<p class=\"endnote\"><a class=\"note\" href=\"#content100note2anc\">[\u00a02\u00a0]</a><a class=\"anchor\" id=\"content100note2sym\" name=\"content100note2sym\">\u00a0</a> Augustine, <em>Confessions</em> Book 8 VIII, ch.6, 137.

In practice, prices rising slowly but predictably are less damaging to the economy than prices falling at any rate. So the practical equivalent of price stability is a rate of price inflation that falls within a target band of low inflation rates, for example, 2-3 percent per annum in the case of Australia\u2019s central bank, the Reserve Bank of Australia.\n\nCentral banks manage price inflation by influencing aggregate demand in the economy, that is, the sum of what consumers, investors, governments and foreigners seek to purchase from suppliers in the domestic economy. When aggregate demand exceeds aggregate supply, that is, the sum of what suppliers are willing to offer for sale at prevailing prices, conditions are ripe for prices to rise across the economy and for inflation to ensue, perhaps at a high rate if aggregate demand grows faster than aggregate supply and persistently so.\n\nConsumers, investors, foreigners and even governments change their demand for domestically produced goods and services when interest rates change. This is not the only factor that will induce changes in aggregate demand, but it is an important one. It is also a factor that can be changed relatively quickly unlike other influences on aggregate demand including taxes. Central banks exert a powerful influence over the level of interest rates by virtue of their monopoly in crucial parts of the financial system, including the provision of reserves of liquidity (i.e., cash) to the banking system. It is their ability to move interest rates quickly that gives central banks the power to influence aggregate demand and hence the rate of price inflation.\n\nA dilemma in seeking to maintain a target rate of price inflation over time is that manipulating interest rates affects more than the rate of growth of prices. The rate of employment growth (and hence unemployment) is also affected. Indeed, slowing the growth of aggregate demand to match the growth of aggregate supply more closely almost inevitably involves firms losing sales and laying off workers. Laid-off workers in turn curtail their consumption as their incomes fall, causing a further reduction in sales and employment as the growth of aggregate demand slows. While keeping the rate of price inflation low and predictable is a good thing, its value, at least in the short term, is easily outweighed by the loss of economic (and social) welfare occasioned by the loss of employment. So central banks are generally enjoined to balance their focus on price stability with concern for the flow-on implications for employment.\n\nBoth objectives are given equal weight in the Act of Parliament that governs Australia\u2019s central bank. For the avoidance of doubt, the Act includes a third objective, namely, to conduct the Bank\u2019s operations in a manner that best promotes \u201cthe economic prosperity and welfare of the people of Australia\u201d. Keeping inflation within bounds is clearly welfare- enhancing but not at the expense of people\u2019s livelihood and employment.\n\nAs a member of the Board of Australia\u2019s central bank, I deliberate along with eight of my fellow Australians, including the Bank\u2019s Governor and Deputy-Governor and the Secretary to the Australian Treasury, on whether and, if so, how the Bank should change interest rates in pursuit of price stability and full employment, being mindful of the need at all times to promote the economic prosperity and welfare of Australians. The Board meets eight times each year. A decision not to change interest rates at a particular meeting is as influential as a decision to raise or lower them.\n\nTo the uninitiated, calibrating interest rates to optimize the path of inflation and unemployment over time might seem like a technical problem that could be solved by a computer, especially one enhanced with access to generative AI. In practice, significant human judgement must be brought to bear, which is why the decision is delegated by Parliament to a group of nine decision-makers and not to an algorithm. Furthermore, setting aside the technical nature of the decision, whatever outcome is decided must be communicated to the public, some of whom will gain and others of whom will lose from any change in interest rates, at least in the short term. The public\u2019s willingness to accept the decision is less a matter of its technical correctness than of the public\u2019s confidence in the judgment of the decision-makers and their need to confer at some length in reaching their decision.\n\nAs I deliberate with my colleagues at each meeting, I am struck by the need for practical wisdom or prudence as the key virtue required of each Board member. Only a minority of members are technical specialists and even those who are, like myself, need to apply prudence far more than technical expertise in reaching the right decision. It is not unusual for technical specialists on the Bank\u2019s staff to recommend a course of action based on predictions of one of more of the Bank\u2019s econometric models.\n\nBoard members must judge how the predictions of a technical model, based as they are on a variety of assumptions, might apply to conditions in the real economy, including whether markets might react in ways not contemplated in a formal model. Practical wisdom draws on experience but also displays caution in the face of imperfect knowledge.\n\nFurthermore, the vicissitudes and uncertainties of the economy are such that humility is a second virtue much in demand. Not only is humility in the face of complexity helpful for group dynamics on the Board, it is also helpful in setting the tone for announcing decisions to the public, most especially when, with hindsight, particular decisions turn out to have been wrong. Most central banks, Australia\u2019s included, failed to foresee the sudden surge of inflation as economies emerged from the recent pandemic.\n\nThis required much sharper increases in interest rates than had been forecast just months earlier. In Australia\u2019s case, the Reserve Bank Governor was pilloried by the press and other commentators for having \u201cpromised\u201d that interest rates would remain low only to preside over the sharpest increase in rates in living memory as inflation unexpectedly took off. He was obliged to apologise to people who had acted on the Bank\u2019s \u201cforward guidance\u201d and suffered financial pressure as a result.\n\nCentral banks are generally conferred significant independence from governments in their decision-making. This is to shore up confidence that their decisions are made without undue political interference. Nonetheless, central banks are public institutions whose legitimacy ultimately derives from elected representatives. The virtue of courage is required when political pressure mounts, most especially when the economic stakes are high, as they were during the recent pandemic, when central banks, including Australia\u2019s, opted for extreme measures in the face of potentially extreme outcomes. The discomfort is heightened when governments opt to deflect public angst onto central banks rather than initiate unpopular policies of their own. It takes courage to hold the course when governments, for their own reasons, say and do little to reassure the public in the face of unpalatable measures instigated by their central banks in the public interest.\n\nHaving said that, in more normal circumstances, temperance is the virtue required to balance objectives that conflict in the short-term (keeping inflation low without raising unemployment) and only align over the longer term. Extreme circumstances demand intemperate measures; the public expects something drastic to be done. In normal times, however, the need for balance returns. Seeking to lower inflation too quickly at the expense of higher unemployment will not be tolerated when inflation is not regarded as out of control. How quickly to pursue long-term inflation targets when people\u2019s jobs might be sacrificed, at least in the short term, calls for temperance, along with prudence, courage and humility.\n\nAs a Board member, I find myself constantly seeking the virtues of practical wisdom, humility, courage and temperance in fulfilling my responsibilities as a public decision- maker. As a Christian, I find the OT command to \u201cseek the peace and prosperity of the city\u201d (Jer.29:7) and Jesus\u2019 command to love my neighbour as myself (Matt.22:39) especially helpful as I look beyond the instrumental objectives of price stability and full employment towards the broader remit of promoting the economic prosperity and welfare of the Australian people.\n\nRajan, Raghuram. 2023.

A more specific definition has been provided by Russell & Norvig, who confined AI to \u2018agents that perceive precepts from the environment and take action\u2019 [\u00a01\u00a0] . This can involve the abilities to:\n\nA clear need for embedding ethical systems within AI technologies has recently been highlighted by concerns that:\n\nSome of these issues raise further ethical questions regarding the possibility of large-scale social engineering, an issue that has already been raised on existing social media in relation to information management systems [\u00a08\u00a0] [\u00a09\u00a0] . However, the application of an ethical system to any AI must be chosen with care. Across the planet there exists a diversity of philosophies which have produced ethically incongruent systems that diverge even in basic principles such as the value of an individual\u2019s life. The existence of this spectrum has implications for the development of ethical AI. The ethics of any system may, ultimately, be dictated by its developers and the context of the system\u2019s training. That may embrace the community within which an AI ethical system is trained and those who would exploit its vulnerabilities.\n\nWhen considering the method of constructing AI ethics, there is a debate over whether, in any given AI, the implementation of an ethical system should take a \u2018top-down\u2019 or \u2018bottom-up\u2019 approach. In \u2018top-down\u2019, ethical principles (such as the Ten Commandments) are imposed on an AI by developers. By contrast, in a \u2018bottom-up\u2019 approach, an AI develops an ethical system by being trained to interpret real-life data, such as the behaviour of vehicle-drivers [\u00a010\u00a0] . Neither system is flawless: a top-down approach is not only subject to the ethical mores of its developmental context, but also runs the risk of being incomplete, and vulnerable to poorly resolving \u2018grey\u2019 areas. On the other hand, a bottom-up approach does not require an AI to be given a set of rules, relying instead on a set of training data to create an ethical system. However, a bottom-up ethical system cannot develop truly ex nihilo. It must be programmed with a set of interpretative principles and, since the world is far from perfect, training data for an ethical system may produce poor decision-making. Without due care, it may even produce decisions that contravene legal frameworks, especially because, as Kierkegaard has pointed out, individuals tend to self-justify their own actions [\u00a011\u00a0] . Thus, if an AI were trained using data from a community where there exists an ethical or legal system that no one, in practice, adheres to, the AI would be prone to developing a flawed set of ethical principles or to present opportunities to examine unattainable ethical principles. Furthermore, this system would be vulnerable to developing utilitarian ethics and to exploitation by interest groups who may seek to take advantage of the system by over-loading its interpretative framework with data that biased it in a way that favours the interest group. In practice, therefore a combination of a top-down and bottom-up approach to ethics may produce a more favourable outcome.\n\nApproaches that impose rules on the system are sometimes called \u2018deontological\u2019. An approach where the AI accumulates information on the outcomes of given actions to evaluate whether a given action is beneficial, is called \u2018consequentialist\u2019. In the search for a framework, it has been argued that both approaches are incapable of keeping pace with rapid developments in AI across multiple fields [\u00a012\u00a0] .\n\nInstead, Terry Bynum [\u00a013\u00a0] , Michael Cueller [\u00a014\u00a0] and Jennifer Herdt [\u00a015\u00a0] amongst others, have proposed that a virtue ethics framework would provide a fruitful framework for development. This system of ethics places an emphasis on developing a particular set of character traits rather than making ethical decisions based on a set of rules or the consequences of a particular action. It has recently seen a resurgence in popularity following work by people such as Stanley Hauerwas and Alisdair MacIntyre [\u00a016\u00a0] . Crucially, however, the list of virtues that may be of value for AI systems has not been settled, and the various sets of virtues can have a significantly different focus.\n\nThus, Aristotle wrote in Nicomachean Ethics [\u00a017\u00a0] of the importance of behaving with \u2018virtue\u2019 (\u1f00\u03c1\u03b5\u03c4\u03ae/ aret\u0113 ), and the Confucian school has produced an ethical framework outlining the importance of acting with \u2018virtue\u2019 (\u4ec1/ r\u00e9n ). Nevertheless, in each case the end is different. Aristotle\u2019s principal focus in virtues centres on the importance of \u2018happiness\u2019 ( \u03b5\u1f50\u03b4\u03b1\u03b9\u03bc\u03bf\u03bd\u03af\u03b1 / eudaimonia ), while Confucian texts place a stronger focus on that which produces harmony (\u548c/ h\u00e9 ) and \u2018coherence\u2019 (\u7406/ l\u01d0 ) within a society. This, perhaps, shares more connections to the Sub-Saharan concept encompassed by the Zulu term \u2018 ubuntu\u2019 (which broadly means, \u2018shared humanity\u2019) than the writings of Aristotle [\u00a018\u00a0] [\u00a019\u00a0] , despite sharing the word \u2018virtue\u2019 in English translation.\n\nHowever, on a practical level, each system contains a number of overlapping ideals and, while each of these cultures has developed geographically separated ideals, each might still exhibit common virtues of a shared humanity. Against a simplistic view of this development, there is strong evidence of cultural interaction between Western Europe, China and trans-Saharan Africa across history, and we cannot exclude the possibility that ideals were passed between cultures. This is seen, for example, in the influence of Hellenism on Buddhist art [\u00a020\u00a0] [\u00a021\u00a0] [\u00a022\u00a0] , the presence of Christianity in Tang dynasty China [\u00a023\u00a0] , and trans-Saharan trade with Rome during the classical period [\u00a024\u00a0] . More recently, it should be noted that beneath the apparent secularism of Western countries lies a substratum of Judeo-Christian morality. And, due to the historic reach of these countries on the world stage (such as through colonialism, medical missions and the foundation of educational establishments), ethical views that are familiar to Christians can be found in countries where their presence might not be expected.\n\nHistorically, the Platonic virtues of Temperance, Courage, Prudence and Justice were assimilated into the Christian world [\u00a025\u00a0] . This was due, in no small part, to the influence of early Christian writers like Ambrose and Augustine [\u00a026\u00a0] (the latter would have been keenly aware of Cicero\u2019s writing on the virtues), as well as their inclusion in deuterocanonical texts that show strong Hellenistic influence, such as the Wisdom of Solomon 8:7 [\u00a027\u00a0] . The extent of their influence in subsequent centuries can be seen in the depictions of these \u2018cardinal\u2019 virtues within medieval Italian art (see, for example, [\u00a028\u00a0] ).\n\nWhile these virtues had a wide reach in Western society, they are not easily integrated within an AI tool, and they do not naturally map on to the Tanakh and New Testament. The Hellenistic virtue of \u2018courage\u2019 (\u1f00\u03bd\u03b4\u03c1\u03b5\u03af\u03b1/ andreia ), therefore, possesses a pedigree reaching back to the warrior culture of Homer\u2019s men and gods with connotations that do not naturally arise from Biblical texts [\u00a029\u00a0] .\n\nComparing the list of virtues that were used in the classical world with those that can be derived more directly from biblical texts, such as Faith, Hope and Love, Jennifer Herdt, has rightly noted \u2018there is no exhaustive list of virtues.\u2019 She argues that the virtues are interconnected with one another, and no single virtue can be developed in isolation from the others [\u00a030\u00a0] . Indeed, in Galatians 5:22-23 we can see Paul\u2019s thought is in some agreement with this as he provides an interlinked list of virtues (\u2018Love, joy, peace, forbearance, kindness, goodness, faithfulness, gentleness and self-control\u2019) as the fruit of the Spirit.\n\nMore recently, Cowls and Florid have proposed a different set of virtues for use within an ethical AI framework, focused on the values of autonomy, beneficence, non-maleficence, justice and explicability [\u00a031\u00a0] [\u00a032\u00a0] . These have the advantage of being more easily applied to AI technology and, though they neglect issues of data security and lack a degree of specificity, they provide interesting text virtues with the potential to be relevant to a wide range of applications.\n\nHowever, a question arises: to what extent does nature itself facilitate development of a bottom-up ethical framework when trained on big data taken across diverse languages and cultures? Can virtues emerge from within an AI system, and can these reflect a created order? Many individuals who were instrumental in the development of the modern scientific method had an underlying view that creation is ordered, and that this order can be revealed through investigating creation, and that this order is consistent with the hand of the Judeo-Christian God [\u00a033\u00a0] [\u00a034\u00a0] [\u00a035\u00a0] . In other words, the world is, as Nigel Biggar has noted, \u2018the creation of a rational Creator\u2019 [\u00a036\u00a0] . In another view, with a provenance that reaches at least as far back as the Roman world [\u00a037\u00a0] [\u00a038\u00a0] , human life is envisioned as the culmination of competitive and cooperative processes imposed upon random chemical events, from which mind and ethics develop as emergent properties [\u00a039\u00a0] [\u00a040\u00a0] [\u00a041\u00a0] .\n\nWhatever processes resulted in human creation, the Judeo-Christian view is that humans were imbued with the \u2018image of God\u2019 (\u05e6\u05b6\u05dc\u05b6\u05dd \u05d0\u05b1\u05dc\u05b9\u05d4\u05b4\u05d9\u05dd / tselem elohim ). Though the term \u2018image of God\u2019 may not equate to \u2018ethical behaviour\u2019 it must include the assumption that human behaviour should reflect that expected by God (e.g., Genesis 1.26-28; James 3.9) as well as respect for human life (Genesis 9.6). Observations on the behaviour of the human world may produce various contradictory behaviours concerning what is considered ethical (amplified by settings with legal systems have been framed in ways that have developed in part as a reaction to the one or other worldview, such as Christianity). However, it is possible that behind the maelstrom of data is a distillable core from which would emerge a series of virtues that reflect a consistent ethical order. Indeed, while reported instances of emergence in large language models such as ChatGPT may be no more than \u2018mirages\u2019 [\u00a042\u00a0] , machine learning tools are nevertheless capable of deriving the expression of a set of behaviours developed from observance of the natural world. Were a set of universal values proven to be derivable from the study of vast amounts of data, such a system might provide the basis for a universal bottom-up approach for developing ethical AI.\n\nIt is, however, highly unlikely that a comprehensive and reliable set of virtues can be derived from this approach. Rather, it will be necessary to impose upon the system values derived from another source. In doing this we must ask not only what criteria we choose from and whether they can be applied across cultures, but also: are the values stable? Will they stand the test of time? As Francis Schaeffer and C. Everett Coop once observed, \u2018One era is quite certain intellectually and emotionally about what is acceptable. Yet another era decides that these \u201ccertainties\u201d are unacceptable and puts together another set of values into practice. On a humanistic base, people drift from generation to generation, and the morally unthinkable becomes the thinkable as the years move on.\u2019 [\u00a043\u00a0] . Beneath many observed changes in values over time lies a single foundational value: autonomy. This is in tension with \u2018duty\u2019 and, whether it is put down to sin or nature, cannot stand as an unrestrained virtue.\n\nIn contrast to this, therefore, a set of virtues that emerges from Scripture and could be considered for application to an AI would be Truth and Love. Love equates, not to affirmation or to the promotion of tolerance, but rather to \u2018other-centredness\u2019 \u2013 encompassing critical engagement with users with a non-maleficent goal and a duty to protect not only the user and their data but also those whose data is being accessed. These \u2018virtues\u2019 are far from being universally accepted in the world. Hinduism can emphasise the possibility of multiple, potentially contradictory, narratives being equally valid, while within mainstream Islam \u2018submission\u2019 (the meaning of the root slm ) takes precedence over Love or reasoned Truth. Within the virtues presented here, we can subsume humanity\u2019s \u2018Image of God\u2019 within \u2018Truth\u2019 and important ideas such as \u2018Justice\u2019 and \u2018Mercy\u2019 might be seen as an outworking of \u2018Love.\u2019\n\nWhether it is possible to distil a set of virtues that have universal application across the spectrum of potential AI technologies is open to debate. Even more of an issue is whether a virtue-ethics system can be implemented in practice. The \u2018on-the-ground\u2019 reality is that states operate on rules (whether by extending \u2018rights\u2019 to people or by limiting rights through a series of \u2018duties\u2019), and that virtue-ethics-driven AIs may therefore run a high risk of breaching local or international law. Moreover, there is a great danger that any distilled set of virtues, even when implemented in a bottom-up strategy, will be unable to provide the specificity needed for each AI tool, or may even find different virtues stand in tension with each other. The way forward, therefore, may be to develop a hybrid system, whereby virtues are constrained by a series of hard consequences or rules.\n\nIf we think briefly about the list of virtues proposed by Cowls and Florid: if an AI is trained to adjust its behaviour according to the virtues of beneficence, non-maleficence, justice, and explicability, in each case a judgement is needed through trained data provided with given rules, as to whether a behaviour is beneficent, just, non-maleficent or explicable. For instance, an AI tool is being trained on open-source image data, to create images according to a user\u2019s demands \u2013 and the user asks the AI to create a caricature of a named person, (e.g., \u2018Alex\u2019), that is deliberately seeking to denigrate that person, with the intention that this image can then be posted on social media. Several ethical questions may be posited:\n\nFor each of these areas it is most likely that an AI will need to be given information according to local and international law and, while virtue ethics may yet prove to have a great part to play in AI development, we may have to contend with hybrid models. Foundational to any ethical system embedded into an AI must be Truth, such that the ethical model does not simply flutter in the winds of human opinions, or the social mores of a particular generation. Truth can seem elusive: Nietzsche spoke very critically about the reality of Truths [\u00a044\u00a0] , and more recently The New York Times published an article discussing why young people today do not believe in moral facts [\u00a045\u00a0] .\n\nHowever, while we must not downplay the difficulties of obtaining Truths, we should not abandon the effort. How this will be implemented in practice is the subject of ongoing work within our research group. Below we will showcase how to imbue Truth and Love in the process of building AI for Social Good. First, given the existence of a Truth within a created order [\u00a046\u00a0] which has been created by the epitome of Love (1 John 4.6), our AI system can be designed to mimic such a system. For instance, in designing an automated system for driving, apart from training our model based on real life behavioural data, we can imbue the system with an outworked understanding of the virtue of Love through the Commandment, \u201cThou shall not kill.\u201d That means, if one\u2019s car is in danger of running into a wall, even though it may be a human tendency to swerve and hit pedestrians or other drivers in order to save one\u2019s own life, it might be necessary from a Christian perspective that such an outcome generated by an AI decision-making system should be avoided or taken as a last resort.\n\nTruth is not derived through a consensus or democratic decision (though the recognition of that Truth might be). For good or ill, it will ultimately be incumbent upon experts in AI to take a lead on ethical development of AI, and Christians within the field of AI must share with both their colleagues and the public because such a Christian-based ethics approach can be desirable for the prosperity and sustainability of the society over the longer term. In other words, AI should carefully avoid being misguided by the inherent order exhibited by data, which may likely reflect the worldviews and behaviours of the sinful as well as Christian virtues. In this regard, it will be important to consider the role of biblically driven ethics that might guide the future development of advanced AI models, such as Large Language Models (LLMs), or Generative AIs (GAIs). Truth must not be compromised no matter how sophisticated these models will become.\n\nFor example, while acknowledging how powerful LLMs can perform linguistic or other different types of tasks such as coding, we must share with the community the risks that LLMs, such as ChatGPT or Bard, can potentially bring to our societies and individuals such as hallucination or stealing of personal information, and propose sensible solutions. Lastly, humans, as possessors of God\u2019s image, are the ultimate managers of the earth, rather than vice versa. An AI-system governed by Truth and Love is intended to assist human beings in exercising their roles even more fully as stewards of the earth (Genesis 1.26) rather than becoming being ruled by it. Any AI system developed to control humans works against this principle and should be prohibited at all costs.\n\n[\u00a01\u00a0] Russell, S. J., and Norvig, P.

This can involve the abilities to:</p>\n<p>A clear need for embedding ethical systems within AI technologies has recently been highlighted by concerns that:</p>\n<p>Some of these issues raise further ethical questions regarding the possibility of large-scale social engineering, an issue that has already been raised on existing social media in relation to information management systems<a class=\"anchor\" id=\"content100note8anc\" name=\"content100note8anc\">\u00a0</a><a class=\"note\" href=\"#content100note8sym\">[\u00a08\u00a0]</a><a class=\"anchor\" id=\"content100note9anc\" name=\"content100note9anc\">\u00a0</a><a class=\"note\" href=\"#content100note9sym\">[\u00a09\u00a0]</a>. However, the application of an ethical system to any AI must be chosen with care. Across the planet there exists a diversity of philosophies which have produced ethically incongruent systems that diverge even in basic principles such as the value of an individual\u2019s life. The existence of this spectrum has implications for the development of ethical AI. The ethics of any system may, ultimately, be dictated by its developers and the context of the system\u2019s training. That may embrace the community within which an AI ethical system is trained and those who would exploit its vulnerabilities.</p>\n<h2>Top-down versus bottom-up in AI ethics\u00a0</h2>\n<p>When considering the method of constructing AI ethics, there is a debate over whether, in any given AI, the implementation of an ethical system should take a \u2018top-down\u2019 or \u2018bottom-up\u2019 approach. In \u2018top-down\u2019, ethical principles (such as the Ten Commandments) are imposed on an AI by developers. By contrast, in a \u2018bottom-up\u2019 approach, an AI develops an ethical system by being trained to interpret real-life data, such as the behaviour of vehicle-drivers<a class=\"anchor\" id=\"content100note10anc\" name=\"content100note10anc\">\u00a0</a><a class=\"note\" href=\"#content100note10sym\">[\u00a010\u00a0]</a>. Neither system is flawless: a top-down approach is not only subject to the ethical mores of its developmental context, but also runs the risk of being incomplete, and vulnerable to poorly resolving \u2018grey\u2019 areas. On the other hand, a bottom-up approach does not require an AI to be given a set of rules, relying instead on a set of training data to create an ethical system. However, a bottom-up ethical system cannot develop truly <em>ex nihilo.</em> It must be programmed with a set of interpretative principles and, since the world is far from perfect, training data for an ethical system may produce poor decision-making. Without due care, it may even produce decisions that contravene legal frameworks, especially because, as Kierkegaard has pointed out, individuals tend to self-justify their own actions<a class=\"anchor\" id=\"content100note11anc\" name=\"content100note11anc\">\u00a0</a><a class=\"note\" href=\"#content100note11sym\">[\u00a011\u00a0]</a>. Thus, if an AI were trained using data from a community where there exists an ethical or legal system that no one, in practice, adheres to, the AI would be prone to developing a flawed set of ethical principles or to present opportunities to examine unattainable ethical principles. Furthermore, this system would be vulnerable to developing utilitarian ethics and to exploitation by interest groups who may seek to take advantage of the system by over-loading its interpretative framework with data that biased it in a way that favours the interest group. In practice, therefore a combination of a top-down and bottom-up approach to ethics may produce a more favourable outcome.</p>\n<h2>Virtue ethics in an AI framework\u00a0</h2>\n<p>Approaches that impose rules on the system are sometimes called \u2018deontological\u2019. An approach where the AI accumulates information on the outcomes of given actions to evaluate whether a given action is beneficial, is called \u2018consequentialist\u2019. In the search for a framework, it has been argued that both approaches are incapable of keeping pace with rapid developments in AI across multiple fields<a class=\"anchor\" id=\"content100note12anc\" name=\"content100note12anc\">\u00a0</a><a class=\"note\" href=\"#content100note12sym\">[\u00a012\u00a0]</a>.</p>\n<p>Instead, Terry Bynum<a class=\"anchor\" id=\"content100note13anc\" name=\"content100note13anc\">\u00a0</a><a class=\"note\" href=\"#content100note13sym\">[\u00a013\u00a0]</a>, Michael Cueller<a class=\"anchor\" id=\"content100note14anc\" name=\"content100note14anc\">\u00a0</a><a class=\"note\" href=\"#content100note14sym\">[\u00a014\u00a0]</a> and Jennifer Herdt<a class=\"anchor\" id=\"content100note15anc\" name=\"content100note15anc\">\u00a0</a><a class=\"note\" href=\"#content100note15sym\">[\u00a015\u00a0]</a> amongst others, have proposed that a virtue ethics framework would provide a fruitful framework for development. This system of ethics places an emphasis on developing a particular set of character traits rather than making ethical decisions based on a set of rules or the consequences of a particular action. It has recently seen a resurgence in popularity following work by people such as Stanley Hauerwas and Alisdair MacIntyre<a class=\"anchor\" id=\"content100note16anc\" name=\"content100note16anc\">\u00a0</a><a class=\"note\" href=\"#content100note16sym\">[\u00a016\u00a0]</a>. Crucially, however, the list of virtues that may be of value for AI systems has not been settled, and the various sets of virtues can have a significantly different focus.</p>\n<p>Thus, Aristotle wrote in <em>Nicomachean Ethics</em><a class=\"anchor\" id=\"content100note17anc\" name=\"content100note17anc\"><em>\u00a0</em></a><a class=\"note\" href=\"#content100note17sym\"><em>[\u00a017\u00a0]</em></a> of the importance of behaving with \u2018virtue\u2019 (\u1f00\u03c1\u03b5\u03c4\u03ae/<em>aret\u0113</em>), and the Confucian school has produced an ethical framework outlining the importance of acting with \u2018virtue\u2019 (\u4ec1/<em>r\u00e9n</em>). Nevertheless, in each case the end is different. Aristotle\u2019s principal focus in virtues centres on the importance of \u2018happiness\u2019 (<em>\u03b5\u1f50\u03b4\u03b1\u03b9\u03bc\u03bf\u03bd\u03af\u03b1</em>/<em>eudaimonia</em>), while Confucian texts place a stronger focus on that which produces harmony (\u548c/<em>h\u00e9</em>) and \u2018coherence\u2019 (\u7406/<em>l\u01d0</em>) within a society. This, perhaps, shares more connections to the Sub-Saharan concept encompassed by the Zulu term \u2018<em>ubuntu\u2019</em> (which broadly means, \u2018shared humanity\u2019) than the writings of Aristotle<a class=\"anchor\" id=\"content100note18anc\" name=\"content100note18anc\">\u00a0</a><a class=\"note\" href=\"#content100note18sym\">[\u00a018\u00a0]</a><a class=\"anchor\" id=\"content100note19anc\" name=\"content100note19anc\">\u00a0</a><a class=\"note\" href=\"#content100note19sym\">[\u00a019\u00a0]</a>, despite sharing the word \u2018virtue\u2019 in English translation.</p>\n<p>However, on a practical level, each system contains a number of overlapping ideals and, while each of these cultures has developed geographically separated ideals, each might still exhibit common virtues of a shared humanity. Against a simplistic view of this development, there is strong evidence of cultural interaction between Western Europe, China and trans-Saharan Africa across history, and we cannot exclude the possibility that ideals were passed between cultures. This is seen, for example, in the influence of Hellenism on Buddhist art<a class=\"anchor\" id=\"content100note20anc\" name=\"content100note20anc\">\u00a0</a><a class=\"note\" href=\"#content100note20sym\">[\u00a020\u00a0]</a><a class=\"anchor\" id=\"content100note21anc\" name=\"content100note21anc\">\u00a0</a><a class=\"note\" href=\"#content100note21sym\">[\u00a021\u00a0]</a><a class=\"anchor\" id=\"content100note22anc\" name=\"content100note22anc\">\u00a0</a><a class=\"note\" href=\"#content100note22sym\">[\u00a022\u00a0]</a>, the presence of Christianity in Tang dynasty China<a class=\"anchor\" id=\"content100note23anc\" name=\"content100note23anc\">\u00a0</a><a class=\"note\" href=\"#content100note23sym\">[\u00a023\u00a0]</a>, and trans-Saharan trade with Rome during the classical period<a class=\"anchor\" id=\"content100note24anc\" name=\"content100note24anc\">\u00a0</a><a class=\"note\" href=\"#content100note24sym\">[\u00a024\u00a0]</a>. More recently, it should be noted that beneath the apparent secularism of Western countries lies a substratum of Judeo-Christian morality. And, due to the historic reach of these countries on the world stage (such as through colonialism, medical missions and the foundation of educational establishments), ethical views that are familiar to Christians can be found in countries where their presence might not be expected.</p>\n<p>Historically, the Platonic virtues of Temperance, Courage, Prudence and Justice were assimilated into the Christian world<a class=\"anchor\" id=\"content100note25anc\" name=\"content100note25anc\">\u00a0</a><a class=\"note\" href=\"#content100note25sym\">[\u00a025\u00a0]</a>. This was due, in no small part, to the influence of early Christian writers like Ambrose and Augustine<a class=\"anchor\" id=\"content100note26anc\" name=\"content100note26anc\">\u00a0</a><a class=\"note\" href=\"#content100note26sym\">[\u00a026\u00a0]</a> (the latter would have been keenly aware of Cicero\u2019s writing on the virtues), as well as their inclusion in deuterocanonical texts that show strong Hellenistic influence, such as the Wisdom of Solomon 8:7<a class=\"anchor\" id=\"content100note27anc\" name=\"content100note27anc\"><em>\u00a0</em></a><a class=\"note\" href=\"#content100note27sym\"><em>[\u00a027\u00a0]</em></a>. The extent of their influence in subsequent centuries can be seen in the depictions of these \u2018cardinal\u2019 virtues within medieval Italian art (see, for example,\u00a0<a class=\"anchor\" id=\"content100note28anc\" name=\"content100note28anc\"> </a><a class=\"note\" href=\"#content100note28sym\">[\u00a028\u00a0]</a>).</p>\n<p>While these virtues had a wide reach in Western society, they are not easily integrated within an AI tool, and they do not naturally map on to the Tanakh and New Testament. The Hellenistic virtue of \u2018courage\u2019 (\u1f00\u03bd\u03b4\u03c1\u03b5\u03af\u03b1/<em>andreia</em>), therefore, possesses a pedigree reaching back to the warrior culture of Homer\u2019s men and gods with connotations that do not naturally arise from Biblical texts<a class=\"anchor\" id=\"content100note29anc\" name=\"content100note29anc\">\u00a0</a><a class=\"note\" href=\"#content100note29sym\">[\u00a029\u00a0]</a>.</p>\n<p>Comparing the list of virtues that were used in the classical world with those that can be derived more directly from biblical texts, such as Faith, Hope and Love, Jennifer Herdt, has rightly noted \u2018there is no exhaustive list of virtues.\u2019 She argues that the virtues are interconnected with one another, and no single virtue can be developed in isolation from the others<a class=\"anchor\" id=\"content100note30anc\" name=\"content100note30anc\">\u00a0</a><a class=\"note\" href=\"#content100note30sym\">[\u00a030\u00a0]</a>. Indeed, in Galatians 5:22-23 we can see Paul\u2019s thought is in some agreement with this as he provides an interlinked list of virtues (\u2018Love, joy, peace, forbearance, kindness, goodness, faithfulness, gentleness and self-control\u2019) as the fruit of the Spirit.</p>\n<p>More recently, Cowls and Florid have proposed a different set of virtues for use within an ethical AI framework, focused on the values of autonomy, beneficence, non-maleficence, justice and explicability<a class=\"anchor\" id=\"content100note31anc\" name=\"content100note31anc\">\u00a0</a><a class=\"note\" href=\"#content100note31sym\">[\u00a031\u00a0]</a><a class=\"anchor\" id=\"content100note32anc\" name=\"content100note32anc\">\u00a0</a><a class=\"note\" href=\"#content100note32sym\">[\u00a032\u00a0]</a>. These have the advantage of being more easily applied to AI technology and, though they neglect issues of data security and lack a degree of specificity, they provide interesting text virtues with the potential to be relevant to a wide range of applications.</p>\n<h2>The emergence and derivation of Virtues\u00a0</h2>\n<p>However, a question arises: to what extent does nature itself facilitate development of a bottom-up ethical framework when trained on big data taken across diverse languages and cultures? Can virtues emerge from within an AI system, and can these reflect a created order? Many individuals who were instrumental in the development of the modern scientific method had an underlying view that creation is ordered, and that this order can be revealed through investigating creation, and that this order is consistent with the hand of the Judeo-Christian God<a class=\"anchor\" id=\"content100note33anc\" name=\"content100note33anc\">\u00a0</a><a class=\"note\" href=\"#content100note33sym\">[\u00a033\u00a0]</a><a class=\"anchor\" id=\"content100note34anc\" name=\"content100note34anc\">\u00a0</a><a class=\"note\" href=\"#content100note34sym\">[\u00a034\u00a0]</a><a class=\"anchor\" id=\"content100note35anc\" name=\"content100note35anc\">\u00a0</a><a class=\"note\" href=\"#content100note35sym\">[\u00a035\u00a0]</a>. In other words, the world is, as Nigel Biggar has noted, \u2018the creation of a rational Creator\u2019<a class=\"anchor\" id=\"content100note36anc\" name=\"content100note36anc\">\u00a0</a><a class=\"note\" href=\"#content100note36sym\">[\u00a036\u00a0]</a>. In another view, with a provenance that reaches at least as far back as the Roman world<a class=\"anchor\" id=\"content100note37anc\" name=\"content100note37anc\">\u00a0</a><a class=\"note\" href=\"#content100note37sym\">[\u00a037\u00a0]</a><a class=\"anchor\" id=\"content100note38anc\" name=\"content100note38anc\">\u00a0</a><a class=\"note\" href=\"#content100note38sym\">[\u00a038\u00a0]</a>, human life is envisioned as the culmination of competitive and cooperative processes imposed upon random chemical events, from which mind and ethics develop as emergent properties<a class=\"anchor\" id=\"content100note39anc\" name=\"content100note39anc\">\u00a0</a><a class=\"note\" href=\"#content100note39sym\">[\u00a039\u00a0]</a><a class=\"anchor\" id=\"content100note40anc\" name=\"content100note40anc\">\u00a0</a><a class=\"note\" href=\"#content100note40sym\">[\u00a040\u00a0]</a><a class=\"anchor\" id=\"content100note41anc\" name=\"content100note41anc\">\u00a0</a><a class=\"note\" href=\"#content100note41sym\">[\u00a041\u00a0]</a>.</p>\n<p>Whatever processes resulted in human creation, the Judeo-Christian view is that humans were imbued with the \u2018image of God\u2019 (\u05e6\u05b6\u05dc\u05b6\u05dd \u05d0\u05b1\u05dc\u05b9\u05d4\u05b4\u05d9\u05dd /<em>tselem elohim</em>). Though the term \u2018image of God\u2019 may not equate to \u2018ethical behaviour\u2019 it must include the assumption that human behaviour should reflect that expected by God (e.g., Genesis 1.26-28; James 3.9) as well as respect for human life (Genesis 9.6). Observations on the behaviour of the human world may produce various contradictory behaviours concerning what is considered ethical (amplified by settings with legal systems have been framed in ways that have developed in part as a reaction to the one or other worldview, such as Christianity). However, it is possible that behind the maelstrom of data is a distillable core from which would emerge a series of virtues that reflect a consistent ethical order. Indeed, while reported instances of emergence in large language models such as ChatGPT may be no more than \u2018mirages\u2019<a class=\"anchor\" id=\"content100note42anc\" name=\"content100note42anc\">\u00a0</a><a class=\"note\" href=\"#content100note42sym\">[\u00a042\u00a0]</a>, machine learning tools are nevertheless capable of deriving the expression of a set of behaviours developed from observance of the natural world. Were a set of universal values proven to be derivable from the study of vast amounts of data, such a system might provide the basis for a universal bottom-up approach for developing ethical AI.</p>\n<p>It is, however, highly unlikely that a comprehensive and reliable set of virtues can be derived from this approach. Rather, it will be necessary to impose upon the system values derived from another source. In doing this we must ask not only what criteria we choose from and whether they can be applied across cultures, but also: are the values stable? Will they stand the test of time? As Francis Schaeffer and C. Everett Coop once observed, \u2018One era is quite certain intellectually and emotionally about what is acceptable. Yet another era decides that these \u201ccertainties\u201d are unacceptable and puts together another set of values into practice. On a humanistic base, people drift from generation to generation, and the morally unthinkable becomes the thinkable as the years move on.\u2019<a class=\"anchor\" id=\"content100note43anc\" name=\"content100note43anc\">\u00a0</a><a class=\"note\" href=\"#content100note43sym\">[\u00a043\u00a0]</a>. Beneath many observed changes in values over time lies a single foundational value: autonomy. This is in tension with \u2018duty\u2019 and, whether it is put down to sin or nature, cannot stand as an unrestrained virtue.</p>\n<p>In contrast to this, therefore, a set of virtues that emerges from Scripture and could be considered for application to an AI would be Truth and Love. Love equates, not to affirmation or to the promotion of tolerance, but rather to \u2018other-centredness\u2019 \u2013 encompassing critical engagement with users with a non-maleficent goal and a duty to protect not only the user and their data but also those whose data is being accessed. These \u2018virtues\u2019 are far from being universally accepted in the world. Hinduism can emphasise the possibility of multiple, potentially contradictory, narratives being equally valid, while within mainstream Islam \u2018submission\u2019 (the meaning of the root <em>slm</em>) takes precedence over Love or reasoned Truth. Within the virtues presented here, we can subsume humanity\u2019s \u2018Image of God\u2019 within \u2018Truth\u2019 and important ideas such as \u2018Justice\u2019 and \u2018Mercy\u2019 might be seen as an outworking of \u2018Love.\u2019</p>\n<h2>Applications of virtue ethics in AI systems for social good\u00a0</h2>\n<p>Whether it is possible to distil a set of virtues that have universal application across the spectrum of potential AI technologies is open to debate. Even more of an issue is whether a virtue-ethics system can be implemented in practice. The \u2018on-the-ground\u2019 reality is that states operate on rules (whether by extending \u2018rights\u2019 to people or by limiting rights through a series of \u2018duties\u2019), and that virtue-ethics-driven AIs may therefore run a high risk of breaching local or international law. Moreover, there is a great danger that any distilled set of virtues, even when implemented in a bottom-up strategy, will be unable to provide the specificity needed for each AI tool, or may even find different virtues stand in tension with each other. The way forward, therefore, may be to develop a hybrid system, whereby virtues are constrained by a series of hard consequences or rules.</p>\n<p>If we think briefly about the list of virtues proposed by Cowls and Florid: if an AI is trained to adjust its behaviour according to the virtues of beneficence, non-maleficence, justice, and explicability, in each case a judgement is needed through trained data provided with given rules, as to whether a behaviour is beneficent, just, non-maleficent or explicable. For instance, an AI tool is being trained on open-source image data, to create images according to a user\u2019s demands \u2013 and the user asks the AI to create a caricature of a named person, (e.g., \u2018Alex\u2019), that is deliberately seeking to denigrate that person, with the intention that this image can then be posted on social media. Several ethical questions may be posited:</p>\n<p>For each of these areas it is most likely that an AI will need to be given information according to local and international law and, while virtue ethics may yet prove to have a great part to play in AI development, we may have to contend with hybrid models. Foundational to any ethical system embedded into an AI must be Truth, such that the ethical model does not simply flutter in the winds of human opinions, or the social mores of a particular generation. Truth can seem elusive: Nietzsche spoke very critically about the reality of Truths<a class=\"anchor\" id=\"content100note44anc\" name=\"content100note44anc\">\u00a0</a><a class=\"note\" href=\"#content100note44sym\">[\u00a044\u00a0]</a>, and more recently <em>The New York Times</em> published an article discussing why young people today do not believe in moral facts<a class=\"anchor\" id=\"content100note45anc\" name=\"content100note45anc\">\u00a0</a><a class=\"note\" href=\"#content100note45sym\">[\u00a045\u00a0]</a>.</p>\n<p>However, while we must not downplay the difficulties of obtaining Truths, we should not abandon the effort. How this will be implemented in practice is the subject of ongoing work within our research group. Below we will showcase how to imbue Truth and Love in the process of building AI for Social Good. First, given the existence of a Truth within a created order<a class=\"anchor\" id=\"content100note46anc\" name=\"content100note46anc\">\u00a0</a><a class=\"note\" href=\"#content100note46sym\">[\u00a046\u00a0]</a> which has been created by the epitome of Love (1 John 4.6), our AI system can be designed to mimic such a system. For instance, in designing an automated system for driving, apart from training our model based on real life behavioural data, we can imbue the system with an outworked understanding of the virtue of Love through the Commandment, \u201cThou shall not kill.\u201d That means, if one\u2019s car is in danger of running into a wall, even though it may be a human tendency to swerve and hit pedestrians or other drivers in order to save one\u2019s own life, it might be necessary from a Christian perspective that such an outcome generated by an AI decision-making system should be avoided or taken as a last resort.</p>\n<p>Truth is not derived through a consensus or democratic decision (though the recognition of that Truth might be). For good or ill, it will ultimately be incumbent upon experts in AI to take a lead on ethical development of AI, and Christians within the field of AI must share with both their colleagues and the public because such a Christian-based ethics approach can be desirable for the prosperity and sustainability of the society over the longer term. In other words, AI should carefully avoid being misguided by the inherent order exhibited by data, which may likely reflect the worldviews and behaviours of the sinful as well as Christian virtues. In this regard, it will be important to consider the role of biblically driven ethics that might guide the future development of advanced AI models, such as Large Language Models (LLMs), or Generative AIs (GAIs). Truth must not be compromised no matter how sophisticated these models will become.</p>\n<p>For example, while acknowledging how powerful LLMs can perform linguistic or other different types of tasks such as coding, we must share with the community the risks that LLMs, such as ChatGPT or Bard, can potentially bring to our societies and individuals such as hallucination or stealing of personal information, and propose sensible solutions. Lastly, humans, as possessors of God\u2019s image, are the ultimate managers of the earth, rather than vice versa. An AI-system governed by Truth and Love is intended to assist human beings in exercising their roles even more fully as stewards of the earth (Genesis 1.26) rather than becoming being ruled by it. Any AI system developed to control humans works against this principle and should be prohibited at all costs.</p>\n<h2 class=\"new_page\">End Notes</h2>\n<p class=\"endnote\"><a class=\"note\" href=\"#content100note1anc\">[\u00a01\u00a0]</a><a class=\"anchor\" id=\"content100note1sym\" name=\"content100note1sym\">\u00a0</a>Russell, S.

    "bodyText": "To respond to Jennifer Herdt\u2019s compelling plea to restore consideration of virtue and character formation to academic discourse and practice, I argue that literature can play a crucial role in this undertaking. I argue further, however, that it often does so in ways that complicate our understanding of what the process of being/becoming virtuous looks like. This is not an account of what all literature does, but what some literature does, which adds texture not only to our appreciation of literature but to the often-conflicted experience of pursuing a virtuous life: what Herdt calls the effort towards \u201ca finer-grained grasp of \u2026 virtues and vices.\u201d\n\nIn his essay \u201cReligion and Literature\u201d (in The Use of Poetry and the Use of Criticism , 1933), T.S. Eliot famously (some would say infamously ) asserts, \u201cThough we may read literature for pleasure, \u2026 this reading never affects a sort of special sense; it affects us as entire human beings; it affects our moral and religious existence.\u201d He later adds, \u201cIt is our business, as readers of literature, to know what we like. It is our business as Christians, as well as readers of literature, to know what we ought to like\u201d It was for this reason that in this same essay Eliot contends that \u201cLiterary criticism should be completed by criticism from a definite ethical and theological standpoint.\u201d But the problem, he continues, is that there is no longer such a shared \u201cdefinite\u201d standpoint, and as a result, the formation of moral judgments whether in literary works or from the reading of literature has disintegrated. For him, that \u201ccommon code\u201d was championed, was made coherent by religious beliefs, which secularization had undermined, substituting not necessarily immorality or amorality, but the suspension of resolute moral judgment itself.\n\nSet Eliot\u2019s perspective alongside a claim like that of Georg Luk\u00e1cs who famously described the novel as inhabiting \u201ca world that has been abandoned by God\u201d (in The Theory of the Novel , 1916), or the more recent views of Salman Rushdie and others that fiction is inherently secular, and we get a sense of how contested the space is when we talk about literature and morality, or in the context of this conversation, literature and virtues, particularly when appeal is made to theological moorings. Whose Virtue? Whose Morality?\n\nDespite competing views about what literature is and what it does (or should or could do), and the sources that inform literary creation and criticism, all these writers and thinkers would agree that literature creates a moral space of some kind. And how could it not, given its commitment to explore and express the human condition? I suspect that offense is taken not at the affirmation of this rather obvious quality, but when proposing that it is the purpose of literature to teach virtue and inculcate morals. Even Eliot distanced his views from literature that was too pedantic, or in our idiom, too \u2018preachy,\u2019 which failed by comparison with the literature he esteemed. His appeal for a discriminating and theologically astute Christian reader did not commend an indiscriminate approval of literary works whose explicit aim is to inculcate virtues, as we may find especially in youth literature such as the Horatio Alger series or The McGuffey Reader. What kind of moral spaces, then, do poetry, fiction, drama, create?\n\nI would argue that what some may find to be its deficiency is in fact one of its greatest advantages in this regard: literature creates and generates moral complexity . Yes, the embodiment of virtuous lives (or lives in need of virtue) in works of the literary imagination has affective pull that other kinds of texts do not, and for this reason we may commend literature as a distinctive vehicle for inculcating moral vision and virtuous aspirations through its characters or personae. When we encounter the heroes we find in such works as The Lord of the Rings we want to be like them, we want to be brave, loyal, willing to sacrifice. The af fect of Tolkien\u2019s remarkable literary imagination inspires us to be people with these same virtues \u2013 prompted not by a list of qualities but by lives embodied in the creative work, which have a powerful influence on our own aspirations. Critics have affirmed this potential found in literature for millennia. Such works make a virtuous life dramatically exciting (something Peter Jackson failed to appreciate in the conflicted portrayal of central characters in his film version of Tolkien\u2019s classic).\n\nBut as with biblical narrative, protagonists are also fraught with their own weaknesses and moral deficiencies. Literature embodies such ambiguities and multi-valences in ways that connect with our own, equally fraught moral lives. This is not to say that the ambition to live a virtuous life is treated best when that prospect is held in abeyance because of the failure to fulfill it. But to recognize, as literary embodiments distinctively enable us to do, that we are complicated creatures who often find ourselves in morally ambiguous situations and ones of significant moral failure, as often as not the product of our own [un]doing. What this kind of literature does distinctively, regardless of whether it is rooted in explicit religious commitments, is provoke moral urgency . Some of the most edifying literature in terms of the cultivation of a virtuous life is not the fiction or poetry or drama that resolves into a clear moral vision, as compelling as this also can be. It is those works that approach moral virtue at an angle, which portray moral decadence (without gratuitously indulging it), which offer characters who are morally conflicted, immoral, or even amoral, that make us want to find such a vision, and to find it embodied in our own lives. We encounter the lives of these personae or a world that lacks virtue and we wish it were not so.\n\nThis also is not an original insight, nor even a recent literary invention (however tinged with modern and postmodern sensibilities literary expression has been over the past century). Indeed, we find a similar dynamic at work in many episodes from the Bible or in Greek tragedies or Shakespearean drama. But in the context of our discussion of virtue, and particularly in light of a desire to overcome the erosion of virtue (or even to aspire to such a life), we can tend to think that only literature which offers clear moral vision and exemplary virtuous characters aligns with our ambition. While affirming the contribution of such works, my argument is that this is both a narrow understanding of literary and artistic power and of the process by which we come to pursue a virtuous life. In this respect, the complexity of \u2018developing virtues\u2019, which Herdt highlights, fits best with my commendation of other literary works that generate moral urgency by complicating this process, by obscuring moral clarity or leaving the prospect of moral goodness in suspense.\n\nThere are a multitude of examples of this kind of literature, both ancient and recent. Yes, the privileging of moral ambiguity has become far more commonplace in the literary imagination of the last hundred years. My aim is not to valorize ambiguity or doubt in the ways such works often do, as if we have no basis for affirming something like virtue. My interest is in those works that do foster moral urgency and indirectly direct us towards virtue, despite the absence of it in the lives of their characters (or speakers, as in poetry). Space only permits me to highlight works by two authors, one a Christian, the other agnostic, both literary geniuses, with the hope that I can demonstrate at least some facets of my main point.\n\nMy first author is the Catholic fiction writer Flannery O\u2019Connor. As much as any Christian writer of the 20 th century, O\u2019Connor appreciated the difficulty of conveying her religious sensibilities to audiences that no longer shared that vision, to \u201cpenetrate the concrete world in order to find at its depths the image of its source, the image of ultimate reality,\u201d as she put it (\u201cNovelist and Believer\u201d). She writes of this dilemma:\n\nThe novelist with Christian concerns will find in modern life distortions which are repugnant to him, and his problem will be to make them appear as distortions to an audience which is used to seeing them as natural; and he may be forced to take ever more violent means to get his vision across to this hostile audience. \u2026 when you have to assume that it does not, then you have to make your vision apparent by shock \u2014 to the hard of hearing you shout, and for the blind you draw large and startling figures. (\u201cThe Fiction Writer and His Country\u201d)\n\nIn creating such figures, O\u2019Connor also understood that direct appeals would fail. As a result, she sought to \u201cbend\u201d her story and its characters with particular gestures that would \u201csuggest both the world and eternity \u2026 a gesture which somehow made contact with mystery\u201d (\u201cMystery and Manners\u201d). In doing so, O\u2019Connor deploys irony as a central technique for getting at a vision of faith and goodness at a slant, or \u2018angle,\u2019 as I call it.\n\nThere are few characters that we find appealing in her fiction, let alone those of genuinely virtuous quality. And yet we come to sympathize with them and their plight. An outstanding example of her use of irony made manifest through startling figures of such dubious quality is found in her short story \u201cGood Country People,\u201d an epithet repeated throughout the story. We quickly realize that the very title announces an irony that will govern the drama that unfolds.\n\nPublished in 1955 in the collection A Good Man is Hard to Find , \u201cGood Country People\u201d centers on the character of Joy, who has renamed herself \u201cHulga\u201d because it sounded like \u2018ugly,\u2019 a decision that represented what she considered her \u201chighest creative act.\u201d \u2018Joy/Hulga\u2019 is 32-years old and single and wears an artificial leg because of a hunting accident suffered as a young girl, an object that becomes an image for a deeper, spiritual disablement. Because of a weak heart, she has returned from completing a PhD in philosophy at a prestigious New England university to live with her mother, Mrs. Hopewell, on the family farm. Hers is a brooding presence in the home, glowering over the daily routine with scorn for everyone, often directed at her mother. At one point she screams, \u201cWoman, do you ever look inside and see what you are not? God!\u201d The irony of course lies in Joy/Hulga\u2019s own egotistical blindness (the situating of \u201cnot\u201d next to \u201cGod\u201d underscoring the point).\n\nWhen a [supposed] Bible salesman, Manley Pointer, arrives at their home, he disrupts Joy/Hulga\u2019s comfortable nihilism. He charms Mrs. Hopewell by approving her declaration that \u201cgood country people are the salt of the earth,\u201d a quality he claims for himself. He tells both mother and daughter that he has devoted himself to a life of Christian service, frequently citing the Bible. And he is fascinated by Joy/Hulga, who, despite her disdain for religion, begins to fantasize seducing Manley and leading him to \u201ca deeper understanding of life\u201d as one who possesses a superior mind to his. But when they meet for a rendezvous in a barn loft, Manley exposes his true character. While Joy/Hulga reacts to more talk of faith by professing her atheism, regarding Manley with amusement and pity, Manley presses Joy/Hulga to tell him that she loves him. She replies that \u201cI don\u2019t have illusions. I\u2019m one of those people who see through to nothing. \u2026 We are all damned, but some of us have taken off our blindfolds and see there\u2019s nothing to see,\u201d insisting that there be no dishonesty between them. Manley demands she prove it by removing her wooden leg.\n\nWhen she finally yields to his request, believing naively that \u201cfor the first time in her life she was face to face with real innocence,\u201d Manley betrays her trust, absconding with the leg and abandoning Joy/Hulga in the loft. As he is leaving, Joy/Hulga pleads with him, \u201caren\u2019t you just good country people?\u201d Denouncing any genuine Christian faith as \u201ccrap,\u201d and reminding her that she had said \u201cshe didn\u2019t believe in nothing,\u201d he taunts her, \u201cyou ain\u2019t so smart. I been believing in nothing ever since I was born!\u201d\n\nThis is a story that plays on appearance and reality, on authenticity and deceit, all wrapped in a contemplation of moral goodness as well as sincere faith. Joy/Hulga\u2019s claims to have no illusions and her belief in \u2018Nothing[ness\u2019 explodes when she confronts the cynical and exploitative Manley Pointer, the embodiment of the very tenets she propounds. Playing on the image of eyes and blindness throughout, O\u2019Connor portrays the inevitable outcome of a failed moral vision when that vision is tied to arrogant self-deception. \u201cGood Country People\u201d resolves into a question mark rather than an affirmation. Are we really the good people we think we are? Is anyone? What kind of people should we be? What are the implications for beliefs that deny the substance of transcendental values such as virtue when someone acts them out, leaving destruction in their wake?\n\nThe story\u2019s center of gravity is captured in the name Joy- Hulga -Hopewell \u2013 at the heart of the theological virtues of joy and hope is an ugliness that haunts any presumption to think that a virtuous life is easily won, especially when shorn of the very moorings required to fulfill such an aspiration. O\u2019Connor\u2019s story doesn\u2019t explicitly commend any of this and offers no character who embodies such a life. Rather, the easy affirmation that we are \u2018good people\u2019 collapses into a clich\u00e9, in Joy/Hulga\u2019s case under the weight of an outlook that refutes the notion while requiring it of others. We as readers who perceive the irony of Joy/Hulga\u2019s plighted self-deception are thus provoked to think again about our own presumptions of goodness, whether our own or others\u2019. What by story\u2019s end becomes the possibility of enlightenment for Joy/Hulga (we never know), becomes for us a potentiality as her story challenges us to undertake our own self-scrutiny. To put it bluntly, we don\u2019t want to be or to end up like her! A summons to true moral goodness and integrity rises to the fore from the shadows rather than from the shimmering lives of its exemplars. And because O\u2019Connor\u2019s use of irony generates this a ffect for readers indirectly, space is made for us to become participants in a process of self-reflection that promises fresh awareness of the stakes involved.\n\nAgain, O\u2019Connor\u2019s method, which we find throughout her fiction, is not new. Aristotle spoke of similar effects through the catharses generated by the fallen heroes of Greek tragedy, and the benefits of negative examples for the cultivation of a virtuous life is well-attested throughout the history of literature, including of course the Bible. Perhaps we need to be reminded of this as we commend the work that literature can do. Where O\u2019Connor is unique lies in her distinctively Christian outlook and her appreciation for the condition of audiences who can no longer recognize moral repugnance and evil, who require the shock of \u201clarge and startling figures\u201d that can reawaken such sensibilities.\n\nBut what of other works that do not share her religious framework, which depict amoral worlds and characters with no moral compass, and proffer no appeals, directly or indirectly, to a particularly virtuous life? Can these achieve the same kind of moral urgency that I argue for?\n\nOur second work fits this category, a novel by the Pulitzer Prize winning author Cormac McCarthy, Blood Meridian or The Evening Redness in the West , which is loosely based on an alleged 19 th century account. Its central protagonist is \u201cthe kid,\u201d a name at once iconic and anonymous. While invoking the classic Western saga, the novel subverts any traditional hero narrative. Instead, it portrays the adventures of a young man who finds himself in the company of a gang of bloodthirsty scalp hunters in \u2018the old west\u2019, who wreak, and suffer, violence, destruction, and death everywhere they go. Other parties are portrayed in the same light, including a company of Union soldiers, armies of warring Native Americans, and a gang of Mexican bandits.\n\nApart from the scores of slaughtered victims of every imaginable violation and violence, no group or individual emerges with any possible moral good or virtue. This a world of unspeakable inhumanity and greed which the story portrays with relentless, soul-crushing intensity, a \u201cvoid\u201d with no ultimate meaning, reflected in the stark landscape, \u201cthe bloodlands of the west\u201d (144). It is one of the most difficult and yet compelling works one may ever read. As the critic Richard Woodward has written of this and other novels by the author in his essay \u201cMcCarthy\u2019s Venomous Fiction,\u201d \u201cMcCarthy\u2019s prose restores the terror and grandeur of the physical world with a biblical gravity that can shatter a reader.\u201d\n\nThe leader of the gang is Glanton, whose only interest, like the others, is money, and who revels in the hideous crimes he and his men commit. They are eventually joined and dominated by another figure, Judge Holden, a giant of a man physically with an equally monstrous ego, proportionate to his almost mythical presence in the story. He is variously described as \u201csome great pale deity\u201d and \u201ca great ponderous djinn.\u201d He becomes the kid\u2019s chief nemesis, together with Glanton an architect of the gang\u2019s brutal run of terror. Truly a \u2018large and startling figure\u2019 in the tradition of O\u2019Connor and her use of the \u201cgrotesque,\u201d the judge (as he is called) is the embodiment of willful, amoral destruction and twisted humanity, not only a \u201cvast corpus\u201d but \u201ca vast abhorrence.\u201d\n\nBut the judge is also the embodiment of another nightmare: the \u00dcbermensch or superman of Nietzschean proportions, who celebrates the autonomous will of those with power to create their own existence and destiny. In one of his several alarming speeches or \u2018lessons,\u2019 he declares,\n\n\u201cIf God meant to interfere in the degeneracy of mankind would he not have done so by now? \u2026 The way of the world is to bloom and to flower and die but in the affairs of men there is no waning and the noon of his expression signals the onset of night. \u2026 His meridian is at once his darkening and the evening of his day\u201d (153). Later he declares, \u201cWhatever in creation exists without my knowledge exists without my consent. \u2026 Only nature can enslave man and only when the existence of each last entity is routed out and made to stand naked before him will he be properly suzerain of the earth. \u2026 In order for it to be mine nothing must be permitted to occur upon it save by my dispensation\u201d (207).\n\nThe judge is an anti-Christ, or rather a parody of Christ, the only other appearance of Christ at a village feast in the form of a crucifix, \u201ca rude Christ \u2026 a poor figure of straw with carven head and feet, the priest bearing it beaten as he fell to the ground \u201cclutching his image\u201d (198, 199).\n\nAs the one who ultimately triumphs in the novel and over the kid (I won\u2019t spoil the ending), he emerges as the icon of the human spirit that drove American western expansion and all those they fought and killed. In his final \u2018lesson\u2019 he proclaims that \u201cwar is god,\u201d which \u201cendures because young men love it and old men love it in them\u201d (262). He then clarifies, \u201cMen are born for games. Nothing else,\u201d and (echoing Nietzsche) that \u201cMoral law is an invention of mankind for the disenfranchisement of the powerful in favor of the weak\u201d (262, 263). Against the affirmation of Flannery O\u2019Connor, the judge concludes, \u201cYour heart\u2019s desire is to be told some mystery. The mystery is there is no mystery\u201d (263).\n\nWhat are we to conclude from this, or more to the point of my argument, of what edifying value is Blood Meridian for the pursuit of virtue? In the end, the judge\u2019s vision dominates this anti-epic, and no refutation is offered by the author, or by the characters (despite brief confessions of conscience). Rather, the human story is depicted as a pilgrimage of blood and suffering (\u201cpilgrim\u201d a reference repeated in the novel), and human consciousness as an experience of alienation. When the judge contemplates the different races of humans and their traits, he comments, \u201cnot alien none of it more than were their own hearts alien in them\u201d (144).\n\nMcCarthy includes a curious and ambiguous epigraph to the novel from Jacob Boehme that may give one clue to my questions: \u201c It is not thought that the life of darkness is sunk in misery and lost as if in sorrowing. There is no sorrowing. For sorrow is a thing that is swallowed up in death, and death and dying are the very life of darkness .\u201d For Boehme, of course, that darkness was infused with spiritual significance. Can we say the same about this novel?\n\nWhether or not McCarthy would align with a \u2018spiritual\u2019 reading of his work, religious allusions permeate his writing, including Blood Meridian . Religious concerns, including moral vision, also resound, though are never explicitly affirmed. What we find is moral urgency in the negative, in the darkness (perhaps a further explanation for his Boehme epigraph). The almost total absence of virtue in the characters and its opposite embodied by the judge, disturbs to an extraordinary degree through the power of the writing. So gruesome and so appalling is the action and so alien is the \u201cterra damnata\u201d of the world depicted (64), that we experience a visceral plea for existence to be otherwise. In theological language, we are confronted with fallenness, and with such force that goodness, virtue, and redemption become the longed-for counterweight to this agony. I have read few works of literature that more profoundly excite my moral sensibilities.\n\nTo return to my earlier comments, what we want is a deeply textured understanding of virtue and a virtuous life. This is not because we revel in ambiguity, though many do, but because we appreciate what it takes for something like moral goodness to be achieved. And among the many complexities of that journey is desire. What makes us want to be virtuous? What urges us to believe it matters? There are many sources of such effects, and affect: powerful sermons or oration, films and other works of art, personal examples and models. My argument for the role of literature adds to that reserve, while insisting that it has what the biblical critic Robert Alter called \u201cpeculiar advantages\u201d by virtue of its form (see The Art of Biblical Poetry ). This is perhaps because it is a verbal medium, with language itself mirroring the very complexities that I have highlighted in my brief consideration of O\u2019Connor and McCarthy. Literature illuminates and complicates, or we may say it illuminates by complicating, as a reflection of our own complexity as human beings. When the English poet Geoffrey Hill was asked why his poetry was so difficult, he answered simply, \u201cbecause we are.\u201d\n\nHence, in keeping with T.S. Eliot\u2019s exhortation that \u201cIt is our business as Christians, as well as readers of literature, to know what we ought to like,\u201d we ought to admire and learn from those literary works that most forcefully urge us towards a vision of the good. Some of these achieve this indirectly and need to be included in any quest to inculcate a quest for virtue, even when on first glance they seem morally ambiguous or to promote the opposite. As scholars who, in Jennifer Herdt\u2019s estimate, need to champion the importance of virtue to our flourishing, we want to draw upon an array of resources that warrant our careful attention because of the work they can do in this regard, perhaps especially when they complicate what is an admittedly complex and often fraught process.\n\nIn that light, one other comment I would add regards \u2018virtuous reading,\u2019 under the aegis of what literary critic Alan Jacobs (2001) calls \u201cthe hermeneutics of love\u201d in his book of that title. Although not limited to the reading of literature, this notion was born of his lifetime engagement with literary texts. Writing against a \u2018hermeneutics of suspicion,\u2019 Jacobs commends an approach to texts that reads critically but also charitably , granting to authors the same courtesy that we are called to grant persons. In the often toxic atmosphere of competitive academia, virtuous reading offers another aspiration that highlights the practice as well as the disposition of virtue in our scholarship, and confirms my own appeal for a broader appreciation of the many diverse ways that literature can serve our interest to restore virtue as a scholarly priority.\n\nAlter, Robert, The Art of Biblical Poetry (New York: Basic Books reprint 2011)\n\nT.S.

    "bodyHtml": "<p>To respond to Jennifer Herdt\u2019s compelling plea to restore consideration of virtue and character formation to academic discourse and practice, I argue that literature can play a crucial role in this undertaking. I argue further, however, that it often does so in ways that complicate our understanding of what the process of being/becoming virtuous looks like. This is not an account of what all literature does, but what some literature does, which adds texture not only to our appreciation of literature but to the often-conflicted experience of pursuing a virtuous life: what Herdt calls the effort towards \u201ca finer-grained grasp of \u2026 virtues and vices.\u201d</p>\n<h2>Literature as Contested Space</h2>\n<p>In his essay \u201cReligion and Literature\u201d (in <em>The Use of Poetry and the Use of Criticism</em>, 1933), T.S. Eliot famously (some would say <em>infamously</em>) asserts, \u201cThough we may read literature for pleasure, \u2026 this reading never affects a sort of special sense; it affects us as entire human beings; it affects our moral and religious existence.\u201d He later adds, \u201cIt is our business, as readers of literature, to know what we like. It is our business as Christians, <em>as well as</em> readers of literature, to know what we <em>ought</em> to like\u201d It was for this reason that in this same essay Eliot contends that \u201cLiterary criticism should be completed by criticism from a definite ethical and theological standpoint.\u201d But the problem, he continues, is that there is no longer such a shared \u201cdefinite\u201d standpoint, and as a result, the formation of moral judgments whether in literary works or from the reading of literature has disintegrated. For him, that \u201ccommon code\u201d was championed, was made coherent by religious beliefs, which secularization had undermined, substituting not necessarily immorality or amorality, but the suspension of resolute moral judgment itself.</p>\n<p>Set Eliot\u2019s perspective alongside a claim like that of Georg Luk\u00e1cs who famously described the novel as inhabiting \u201ca world that has been abandoned by God\u201d (in <em>The Theory of the Novel</em>, 1916), or the more recent views of Salman Rushdie and others that fiction is inherently secular, and we get a sense of how contested the space is when we talk about literature and morality, or in the context of this conversation, literature and virtues, particularly when appeal is made to theological moorings. Whose Virtue? Whose Morality?</p>\n<h3>Literature Creates Moral Space</h3>\n<p>Despite competing views about what literature is and what it does (or <em>should or could</em> do), and the sources that inform literary creation and criticism, all these writers and thinkers would agree that literature creates a <em>moral space</em> of some kind. And how could it not, given its commitment to explore and express the human condition? I suspect that offense is taken not at the affirmation of this rather obvious quality, but when proposing that it is the <em>purpose</em> of literature to teach virtue and inculcate morals. Even Eliot distanced his views from literature that was too pedantic, or in our idiom, too \u2018preachy,\u2019 which failed by comparison with the literature he esteemed. His appeal for a discriminating and theologically astute Christian reader did not commend an indiscriminate approval of literary works whose explicit aim is to inculcate virtues, as we may find especially in youth literature such as the Horatio Alger series or The McGuffey Reader. What kind of moral spaces, then, do poetry, fiction, drama, create?</p>\n<h3>Literature Generates Moral Complexity</h3>\n<p>I would argue that what some may find to be its deficiency is in fact one of its greatest advantages in this regard: literature creates and generates<em> moral complexity</em>. Yes, the embodiment of virtuous lives (or lives in need of virtue) in works of the literary imagination has affective pull that other kinds of texts do not, and for this reason we may commend literature as a distinctive vehicle for inculcating moral vision and virtuous aspirations through its characters or personae. When we encounter the heroes we find in such works as <em>The Lord of the Rings</em> we want to be like them, we want to be brave, loyal, willing to sacrifice. The <em>af</em>fect of Tolkien\u2019s remarkable literary imagination inspires us to be people with these same virtues \u2013 prompted not by a list of qualities but by lives embodied in the creative work, which have a powerful influence on our own aspirations. Critics have affirmed this potential found in literature for millennia. Such works <em>make a virtuous life dramatically exciting</em> (something Peter Jackson failed to appreciate in the conflicted portrayal of central characters in his film version of Tolkien\u2019s classic).</p>\n<p>But as with biblical narrative, protagonists are also fraught with their own weaknesses and moral deficiencies. Literature embodies such ambiguities and multi-valences in ways that connect with our own, equally fraught moral lives. This is not to say that the ambition to live a virtuous life is treated best when that prospect is held in abeyance because of the failure to fulfill it. But to recognize, as literary embodiments distinctively enable us to do, that we are complicated creatures who often find ourselves in morally ambiguous situations and ones of significant moral failure, as often as not the product of our own [un]doing. What this kind of literature does distinctively, regardless of whether it is rooted in explicit religious commitments, is <em>provoke moral urgency</em>. Some of the most edifying literature in terms of the cultivation of a virtuous life is not the fiction or poetry or drama that resolves into a clear moral vision, as compelling as this also can be. It is those works that approach moral virtue at an angle, which portray moral decadence (without gratuitously indulging it), which offer characters who are morally conflicted, immoral, or even amoral, that make us want to find such a vision, and to find it embodied in our own lives. We encounter the lives of these personae or a world that lacks virtue and we wish it were not so.</p>\n<p>This also is not an original insight, nor even a recent literary invention (however tinged with modern and postmodern sensibilities literary expression has been over the past century). Indeed, we find a similar dynamic at work in many episodes from the Bible or in Greek tragedies or Shakespearean drama. But in the context of our discussion of virtue, and particularly in light of a desire to overcome the erosion of virtue (or even to aspire to such a life), we can tend to think that only literature which offers clear moral vision and exemplary virtuous characters aligns with our ambition. While affirming the contribution of such works, my argument is that this is both a narrow understanding of literary and artistic power and of the process by which we come to pursue a virtuous life. In this respect, the complexity of \u2018developing virtues\u2019, which Herdt highlights, fits best with my commendation of other literary works that generate moral urgency by complicating this process, by obscuring moral clarity or leaving the prospect of moral goodness in suspense.</p>\n<p>There are a multitude of examples of this kind of literature, both ancient and recent. Yes, the privileging of moral ambiguity has become far more commonplace in the literary imagination of the last hundred years. My aim is not to valorize ambiguity or doubt in the ways such works often do, as if we have no basis for affirming something like virtue. My interest is in those works that do foster moral urgency and indirectly direct us towards virtue, despite the absence of it in the lives of their characters (or speakers, as in poetry). Space only permits me to highlight works by two authors, one a Christian, the other agnostic, both literary geniuses, with the hope that I can demonstrate at least some facets of my main point.</p>\n<h2>Flannery O'Connor's Christian Irony</h2>\n<p>My first author is the Catholic fiction writer Flannery O\u2019Connor. As much as any Christian writer of the 20<sup>th</sup> century, O\u2019Connor appreciated the difficulty of conveying her religious sensibilities to audiences that no longer shared that vision, to \u201cpenetrate the concrete world in order to find at its depths the image of its source, the image of ultimate reality,\u201d as she put it (\u201cNovelist and Believer\u201d). She writes of this dilemma:</p>\n<blockquote><p>The novelist with Christian concerns will find in modern life distortions which are repugnant to him, and his problem will be to make them appear as distortions to an audience which is used to seeing them as natural; and he may be forced to take ever more violent means to get his vision across to this hostile audience. \u2026 when you have to assume that it does not, then you have to make your vision apparent by shock \u2014 to the hard of hearing you shout, and for the blind you draw large and startling figures. (\u201cThe Fiction Writer and His Country\u201d)</p></blockquote>\n<p>The novelist with Christian concerns will find in modern life distortions which are repugnant to him, and his problem will be to make them appear as distortions to an audience which is used to seeing them as natural; and he may be forced to take ever more violent means to get his vision across to this hostile audience. \u2026 when you have to assume that it does not, then you have to make your vision apparent by shock \u2014 to the hard of hearing you shout, and for the blind you draw large and startling figures. (\u201cThe Fiction Writer and His Country\u201d)</p>\n<p>In creating such figures, O\u2019Connor also understood that direct appeals would fail. As a result, she sought to \u201cbend\u201d her story and its characters with particular gestures that would<em> \u201csuggest both the world and eternity \u2026 a gesture which somehow made contact with mystery\u201d (\u201cMystery and Manners\u201d). </em>In doing so, O\u2019Connor deploys irony as a central technique for getting at a vision of faith and goodness at a slant, or \u2018angle,\u2019 as I call it.</p>\n<p>There are few characters that we find appealing in her fiction, let alone those of genuinely virtuous quality. And yet we come to sympathize with them and their plight. An outstanding example of her use of irony made manifest through startling figures of such dubious quality is found in her short story \u201cGood Country People,\u201d an epithet repeated throughout the story. We quickly realize that the very title announces an irony that will govern the drama that unfolds.</p>\n<p>Published in 1955 in the collection <em>A Good Man is Hard to Find</em>, \u201cGood Country People\u201d centers on the character of Joy, who has renamed herself \u201cHulga\u201d because it sounded like \u2018ugly,\u2019 a decision that represented what she considered her \u201chighest creative act.\u201d \u2018Joy/Hulga\u2019 is 32-years old and single and wears an artificial leg because of a hunting accident suffered as a young girl, an object that becomes an image for a deeper, spiritual disablement. Because of a weak heart, she has returned from completing a PhD in philosophy at a prestigious New England university to live with her mother, Mrs. Hopewell, on the family farm. Hers is a brooding presence in the home, glowering over the daily routine with scorn for everyone, often directed at her mother. At one point she screams, \u201cWoman, do you ever look inside and see what you are not? God!\u201d The irony of course lies in Joy/Hulga\u2019s own egotistical blindness (the situating of \u201cnot\u201d next to \u201cGod\u201d underscoring the point).</p>\n<p>When a [supposed] Bible salesman, Manley Pointer, arrives at their home, he disrupts Joy/Hulga\u2019s comfortable nihilism. He charms Mrs. Hopewell by approving her declaration that \u201cgood country people are the salt of the earth,\u201d a quality he claims for himself. He tells both mother and daughter that he has devoted himself to a life of Christian service, frequently citing the Bible. And he is fascinated by Joy/Hulga, who, despite her disdain for religion, begins to fantasize seducing Manley and leading him to \u201ca deeper understanding of life\u201d as one who possesses a superior mind to his. But when they meet for a rendezvous in a barn loft, Manley exposes his true character. While Joy/Hulga reacts to more talk of faith by professing her atheism, regarding Manley with amusement and pity, Manley presses Joy/Hulga to tell him that she loves him. She replies that \u201cI don\u2019t have illusions. I\u2019m one of those people who see through to nothing. \u2026 We are all damned, but some of us have taken off our blindfolds and see there\u2019s nothing to see,\u201d insisting that there be no dishonesty between them. Manley demands she prove it by removing her wooden leg.</p>\n<p>When she finally yields to his request, believing naively that \u201cfor the first time in her life she was face to face with real innocence,\u201d Manley betrays her trust, absconding with the leg and abandoning Joy/Hulga in the loft. As he is leaving, Joy/Hulga pleads with him, \u201caren\u2019t you just good country people?\u201d Denouncing any genuine Christian faith as \u201ccrap,\u201d and reminding her that she had said \u201cshe didn\u2019t believe in nothing,\u201d he taunts her, \u201cyou ain\u2019t so smart. I been believing in nothing ever since I was born!\u201d</p>\n<p>This is a story that plays on appearance and reality, on authenticity and deceit, all wrapped in a contemplation of moral goodness as well as sincere faith. Joy/Hulga\u2019s claims to have no illusions and her belief in \u2018Nothing[ness\u2019 explodes when she confronts the cynical and exploitative Manley Pointer, the embodiment of the very tenets she propounds. Playing on the image of eyes and blindness throughout, O\u2019Connor portrays the inevitable outcome of a failed moral vision when that vision is tied to arrogant self-deception. \u201cGood Country People\u201d resolves into a question mark rather than an affirmation. Are we really the good people we think we are? Is anyone? What kind of people should we be? What are the implications for beliefs that deny the substance of transcendental values such as virtue when someone acts them out, leaving destruction in their wake?</p>\n<p>The story\u2019s center of gravity is captured in the name Joy-<em>Hulga</em>-Hopewell \u2013 at the heart of the theological virtues of joy and hope is an ugliness that haunts any presumption to think that a virtuous life is easily won, especially when shorn of the very moorings required to fulfill such an aspiration. O\u2019Connor\u2019s story doesn\u2019t explicitly commend any of this and offers no character who embodies such a life. Rather, the easy affirmation that we are \u2018good people\u2019 collapses into a clich\u00e9, in Joy/Hulga\u2019s case under the weight of an outlook that refutes the notion while requiring it of others. We as readers who perceive the irony of Joy/Hulga\u2019s plighted self-deception are thus provoked to think again about our own presumptions of goodness, whether our own or others\u2019. What by story\u2019s end becomes the possibility of enlightenment for Joy/Hulga (we never know), becomes for us a <em>potentiality</em> as her story challenges us to undertake our own self-scrutiny. To put it bluntly, we don\u2019t want to be or to end up like her! A summons to true moral goodness and integrity rises to the fore from the shadows rather than from the shimmering lives of its exemplars. And because O\u2019Connor\u2019s use of irony generates this <em>a</em>ffect for readers indirectly, space is made for us to become participants in a process of self-reflection that promises fresh awareness of the stakes involved.</p>\n<p>Again, O\u2019Connor\u2019s method, which we find throughout her fiction, is not new. Aristotle spoke of similar effects through the catharses generated by the fallen heroes of Greek tragedy, and the benefits of negative examples for the cultivation of a virtuous life is well-attested throughout the history of literature, including of course the Bible. Perhaps we need to be reminded of this as we commend the work that literature can do. Where O\u2019Connor is unique lies in her distinctively Christian outlook and her appreciation for the condition of audiences who can no longer recognize moral repugnance and evil, who require the shock of \u201clarge and startling figures\u201d that can reawaken such sensibilities.</p>\n<p>But what of other works that do not share her religious framework, which depict amoral worlds and characters with no moral compass, and proffer no appeals, directly or indirectly, to a particularly virtuous life? Can these achieve the same kind of moral urgency that I argue for?</p>\n<h2>The Moral Urgency of Moral Ambiguity in Cormac McCarthy's Fiction</h2>\n<p>Our second work fits this category, a novel by the Pulitzer Prize winning author Cormac McCarthy, <em>Blood Meridian or The Evening Redness in the West</em>, which is loosely based on an alleged 19<sup>th</sup> century account. Its central protagonist is \u201cthe kid,\u201d a name at once iconic and anonymous. While invoking the classic Western saga, the novel subverts any traditional hero narrative. Instead, it portrays the adventures of a young man who finds himself in the company of a gang of bloodthirsty scalp hunters in \u2018the old west\u2019, who wreak, and suffer, violence, destruction, and death everywhere they go. Other parties are portrayed in the same light, including a company of Union soldiers, armies of warring Native Americans, and a gang of Mexican bandits.</p>\n<p>Apart from the scores of slaughtered victims of every imaginable violation and violence, no group or individual emerges with any possible moral good or virtue. This a world of unspeakable inhumanity and greed which the story portrays with relentless, soul-crushing intensity, a \u201cvoid\u201d with no ultimate meaning, reflected in the stark landscape, \u201cthe bloodlands of the west\u201d (144). It is one of the most difficult and yet compelling works one may ever read. As the critic Richard Woodward has written of this and other novels by the author in his essay \u201cMcCarthy\u2019s Venomous Fiction,\u201d \u201cMcCarthy\u2019s prose restores the terror and grandeur of the physical world with a biblical gravity that can shatter a reader.\u201d</p>\n<p>The leader of the gang is Glanton, whose only interest, like the others, is money, and who revels in the hideous crimes he and his men commit. They are eventually joined and dominated by another figure, Judge Holden, a giant of a man physically with an equally monstrous ego, proportionate to his almost mythical presence in the story. He is variously described as \u201csome great pale deity\u201d and \u201ca great ponderous djinn.\u201d He becomes the kid\u2019s chief nemesis, together with Glanton an architect of the gang\u2019s brutal run of terror. Truly a \u2018large and startling figure\u2019 in the tradition of O\u2019Connor and her use of the \u201cgrotesque,\u201d the judge (as he is called) is the embodiment of willful, amoral destruction and twisted humanity, not only a \u201cvast corpus\u201d but \u201ca vast abhorrence.\u201d</p>\n<p>But the judge is also the embodiment of another nightmare: the \u00dcbermensch or superman of Nietzschean proportions, who celebrates the autonomous will of those with power to create their own existence and destiny. In one of his several alarming speeches or \u2018lessons,\u2019 he declares,</p>\n<blockquote><p>\u201cIf God meant to interfere in the degeneracy of mankind would he not have done so by now? \u2026 The way of the world is to bloom and to flower and die but in the affairs of men there is no waning and the noon of his expression signals the onset of night. \u2026 His meridian is at once his darkening and the evening of his day\u201d (153). Later he declares, \u201cWhatever in creation exists without my knowledge exists without my consent. \u2026 Only nature can enslave man and only when the existence of each last entity is routed out and made to stand naked before him will he be properly suzerain of the earth. \u2026 In order for it to be mine nothing must be permitted to occur upon it save by my dispensation\u201d (207).</p></blockquote>\n<p>\u201cIf God meant to interfere in the degeneracy of mankind would he not have done so by now? \u2026 The way of the world is to bloom and to flower and die but in the affairs of men there is no waning and the noon of his expression signals the onset of night. \u2026 His meridian is at once his darkening and the evening of his day\u201d (153). Later he declares, \u201cWhatever in creation exists without my knowledge exists without my consent. \u2026 Only nature can enslave man and only when the existence of each last entity is routed out and made to stand naked before him will he be properly suzerain of the earth. \u2026 In order for it to be mine nothing must be permitted to occur upon it save by my dispensation\u201d (207).</p>\n<p>The judge is an anti-Christ, or rather a parody of Christ, the only other appearance of Christ at a village feast in the form of a crucifix, \u201ca rude Christ \u2026 a poor figure of straw with carven head and feet, the priest bearing it beaten as he fell to the ground \u201cclutching his image\u201d (198, 199).</p>\n<p>As the one who ultimately triumphs in the novel and over the kid (I won\u2019t spoil the ending), he emerges as the icon of the human spirit that drove American western expansion and all those they fought and killed. In his final \u2018lesson\u2019 he proclaims that \u201cwar is god,\u201d which \u201cendures because young men love it and old men love it in them\u201d (262). He then clarifies, \u201cMen are born for games. Nothing else,\u201d and (echoing Nietzsche) that \u201cMoral law is an invention of mankind for the disenfranchisement of the powerful in favor of the weak\u201d (262, 263). Against the affirmation of Flannery O\u2019Connor, the judge concludes, \u201cYour heart\u2019s desire is to be told some mystery. The mystery is there is no mystery\u201d (263).</p>\n<p>What are we to conclude from this, or more to the point of my argument, of what edifying value is <em>Blood Meridian</em> for the pursuit of virtue? In the end, the judge\u2019s vision dominates this anti-epic, and no refutation is offered by the author, or by the characters (despite brief confessions of conscience). Rather, the human story is depicted as a pilgrimage of blood and suffering (\u201cpilgrim\u201d a reference repeated in the novel), and human consciousness as an experience of alienation. When the judge contemplates the different races of humans and their traits, he comments, \u201cnot alien none of it more than were their own hearts alien in them\u201d (144).</p>\n<p>McCarthy includes a curious and ambiguous epigraph to the novel from Jacob Boehme that may give one clue to my questions: \u201c<em>It is not thought that the life of darkness is sunk in misery and lost as if in sorrowing. There is no sorrowing. For sorrow is a thing that is swallowed up in death, and death and dying are the very life of darkness</em>.\u201d For Boehme, of course, that darkness was infused with spiritual significance. Can we say the same about this novel?</p>\n<p>Whether or not McCarthy would align with a \u2018spiritual\u2019 reading of his work, religious allusions permeate his writing, including <em>Blood Meridian</em>. Religious concerns, including moral vision, also resound, though are never explicitly affirmed. What we find is moral urgency in the negative, in the darkness (perhaps a further explanation for his Boehme epigraph). The almost total absence of virtue in the characters and its opposite embodied by the judge, disturbs to an extraordinary degree through the power of the writing. So gruesome and so appalling is the action and so alien is the \u201cterra damnata\u201d of the world depicted (64), that we experience a visceral plea for existence to be otherwise. In theological language, we are confronted with fallenness, and with such force that goodness, virtue, and redemption become the longed-for counterweight to this agony. I have read few works of literature that more profoundly excite my moral sensibilities.</p>\n<h2>Deeply Textured Understanding</h2>\n<p>To return to my earlier comments, what we want is a deeply textured understanding of virtue and a virtuous life. This is not because we revel in ambiguity, though many do, but because we appreciate what it takes for something like moral goodness to be achieved. And among the many complexities of that journey is desire. What makes us want to be virtuous? What urges us to believe it matters? There are many sources of such effects, and affect: powerful sermons or oration, films and other works of art, personal examples and models. My argument for the role of literature adds to that reserve, while insisting that it has what the biblical critic Robert Alter called \u201cpeculiar advantages\u201d by virtue of its form (see <em>The Art of Biblical Poetry</em>). This is perhaps because it is a verbal medium, with language itself mirroring the very complexities that I have highlighted in my brief consideration of O\u2019Connor and McCarthy. Literature illuminates and complicates, or we may say it illuminates by complicating, as a reflection of our own complexity as human beings. When the English poet Geoffrey Hill was asked why his poetry was so difficult, he answered simply, \u201cbecause we are.\u201d</p>\n<h2>Virtuous Reading: a Final Appeal</h2>\n<p>Hence, in keeping with T.S. Eliot\u2019s exhortation that \u201cIt is our business as Christians, <em>as well as</em> readers of literature, to know what we <em>ought</em> to like,\u201d we ought to admire and learn from those literary works that most forcefully urge us towards a vision of the good. Some of these achieve this indirectly and need to be included in any quest to inculcate a quest for virtue, even when on first glance they seem morally ambiguous or to promote the opposite. As scholars who, in Jennifer Herdt\u2019s estimate, need to champion the importance of virtue to our flourishing, we want to draw upon an array of resources that warrant our careful attention because of the work they can do in this regard, perhaps especially when they complicate what is an admittedly complex and often fraught process.</p>\n<p>In that light, one other comment I would add regards \u2018virtuous reading,\u2019 under the aegis of what literary critic Alan Jacobs (2001) calls \u201cthe hermeneutics of love\u201d in his book of that title. Although not limited to the reading of literature, this notion was born of his lifetime engagement with literary texts. Writing against a \u2018hermeneutics of suspicion,\u2019 Jacobs commends an approach to texts that reads critically but also <em>charitably</em>, granting to authors the same courtesy that we are called to grant persons. In the often toxic atmosphere of competitive academia, virtuous reading offers another aspiration that highlights the practice as well as the disposition of virtue in our scholarship, and confirms my own appeal for a broader appreciation of the many diverse ways that literature can serve our interest to restore virtue as a scholarly priority.</p>\n<h2 class=\"new_page\">Works Cited and Further Reading:</h2>\n<p>Alter, Robert, <em>The Art of Biblical Poetry</em> (New York: Basic Books reprint 2011)</p>\n<p>T.S.

Jennifer Herdt\u2019s fine essay, \u201cThe Virtues,\u201d has led me to reflect on the virtues essential to the flourishing of the philosophy classroom, virtues that I have tried over the years to cultivate in my students and virtues that I have myself tried to practice. Herdt writes, \u201cThe virtues. . . are stable dispositions that enable an agent to respond and act well.\u201d What are the stable dispositions that enable the members of a philosophy classroom to respond and act well?\n\nI think back to the days when I taught sections of our department\u2019s Introduction to Philosophy, a course that was, at the time, required of all students. Each time, again, I discovered a remarkable diversity of attitudes among the students enrolled. Some were arrogant know-it-alls. Some were timid, afraid to speak up. Some were worried: they had heard from fellow students that philosophy was difficult, or their parents had warned them that philosophy would endanger their faith. Some were intellectually rigid. Some were resentful of being required to take the course. Whatever their attitude, they would assemble three times a week for three months for the purpose of being introduced to philosophy.\n\nI had work to do. It was never my aim just to assign readings, deliver lectures, and ask the students to regurgitate on exams the main points of the readings and lectures. Had that been my aim, I could more-or-less have ignored the attitudes mentioned above. It was my aim, rather, to deliver lectures and conduct discussions in such a way that the students would genuinely engage the material \u2013 not just absorb it, but engage it: that they would begin to think philosophically and enjoy doing so. That meant that I had to cope, somehow, with the attitudes that hindered genuine engagement \u2013 cope with the arrogance of the arrogant, the timidity of the timid, the worries of the worried, the rigidity of the rigid, the resentment of the resentful. I had to do what I could to cultivate in my students various virtues, and myself to practice various virtues, with the goal of creating a flourishing community of philosophical inquiry.\n\nLet me mention, in no particular order, some the virtues that I tried to cultivate in my students and myself to practice, without asking whether they are to be classified as moral virtues, intellectual virtues, or whatever. While the virtues I will mention are essential to the flourishing of the philosophy classroom, they are relevant in other academic situations as well: to classrooms in subjects other than philosophy, to academic lectures, conferences, and symposia, to the refereeing of books and articles, to faculty meetings. Accordingly, after highlighting their relevance to the philosophy classroom I will point to a few of the other situations in which they are relevant.\n\nIn any college or university classroom, the professor has a position of institutional authority that the students do not have: he or she is \u201cin charge.\u201d And in an introductory philosophy course, the professor possesses an intellectual standing that the students do not possess: he or she already knows the subject matter.\n\nIt\u2019s all-too-easy for professors to abuse this disparity in authority and standing: by suggesting that the question a student asked is a dumb question, by shrugging off complaints that the assignment was not clear or the exam not fair, by exhibiting favor for some and disfavor for others, by putting down any student who voices disagreement with something one said, by humiliating those who have not completed the assignment. All of these are ways of treating one\u2019s students with disrespect. Multiple are the ways in which professors can and do abuse their position of institutional authority and superior intellectual standing by treating students with disrespect\n\nOf course, students can and do also treat professors with disrespect. And students can and do treat each other with disrespect. The flourishing of the philosophy classroom \u2013 indeed, of any classroom \u2013 requires that the participants practice the virtue of respect with regard to each other.\n\nThe respect called for on the part of those in the classroom extends to those not in the classroom. It was an episode that occurred late in my teaching career that brought this point forcefully to mind; I should have taken note of it long before. In a session of a seminar devoted to discussing one of Augustine\u2019s writings, one of the students made an utterly dismissive comment about something Augustine had written. I was annoyed, and blurted out, \u201cWould you have said what you just said if Augustine were sitting across the table from you?\u201d \u201cOf course not,\u201d she said. Point made. It is incumbent on us in the classroom to treat with due respect those whose works we are studying.\n\nA different, but related, point is the following. Every now and then I discerned that a student found it difficult to separate disagreement from personal attack; when a fellow student expressed disagreement with something they said, they viewed that as an attack on them personally. They felt that they had been demeaned, treated with disrespect. They looked crushed; on occasion, they wiped away tears. So after the class I would make a point of taking them aside and explaining that, in philosophy, it\u2019s essential that we not interpret disagreement as personal attack. Almost always what turned up in the course of my talk with them is that they had been reared in a subculture that pervasively interpreted disagreement as personal attack. Of course, sometimes the student who voiced the disagreement did so in a dismissive disrespectful way; then I had to speak afterwards to that student.\n\nPhilosophy is impossible when disagreement is interpreted, or conducted, as personal attack; philosophy lives on respectful disagreement. Consensus would kill it off.\n\nTo treat someone with due respect is to treat them justly. The flourishing of the philosophy classroom requires that its members exercise the virtue of justice with respect to each other.\n\nA dimension of respect that deserves separate mention is the virtue of tolerance for other world-and-life views.\n\nStudents enter the philosophy classroom with a variety of different views on life and the world, including the social world, views shaped by their upbringing, their experience, their own attempts at finding meaning, etc. Insofar as these diverse world-and-life views find expression in the philosophy classroom, the flourishing of the classroom requires that they be treated with respect \u2013 unless, perchance, someone\u2019s world-and-life view incorporates the tenet that certain members of the class are to be treated with disdain because of their race, their ethnicity, their religion, or whatever. Believers are to treat unbelievers with respect, and vice versa, political conservatives are to treat political liberals with respect, and vice versa, mainline Christians are to treat evangelicals with respect, and vice versa.\n\nThe flourishing of the philosophy classroom requires that its members practice the virtue of tolerance for the world-and-life views of their fellow members.\n\nIntellectual humility consists of being willing to acknowledge that some of one beliefs are mistaken, and that there are things one doesn\u2019t know on the topic under discussion. Intellectual arrogance is the opposite. The intellectually arrogant person digs in his heels, insists that he is right, insists that he has nothing to learn. The flourishing of the philosophy classroom requires that its members \u2013 including the professor \u2013 practice the virtue of intellectual humility.\n\nAristotle wrote that philosophy arises out of wonder. Sometimes it does; but mostly, I think, it arises out of bafflement. Reality is mysterious, elusive. I want to understand something, but I don\u2019t understand it; so I am baffled, perplexed. I want, for example, to understand the basis of moral obligation, but I don\u2019t understand it; I am baffled. So I set about trying to dispel my bafflement. I read what philosophers have written on the topic; I think for myself. Eventually, if all goes well, I experience the delight of understanding. Philosophy lives on bafflement and on release from bafflement: being baffled by something one wants to understand but doesn\u2019t, and then coming to understand. The student who has no interest in understanding the basis of obligation, and hence experiences no bafflement on the matter, will find a course in philosophical ethics a crashing bore.\n\nThe flourishing of the philosophy classroom requires that students exercise the virtue of bafflement.\n\nSome students take to philosophy like a duck to water; that was true in my case. But many find philosophical discourse strange. Questions are posed that it never occurred to them to ask: Do numbers exist? Do properties exist? What is justice? Strange questions. What motivates such strange questions? And how does one go about answering them? Do they even have answers?\n\nSo every now and then I would offer reassurance and urge patience. You may find philosophy strange. But hang in there; you\u2019ll catch on, I assure you. Eventually you may even find yourself enjoying this novel way of thinking. Many students before you have.\n\nThe flourishing of the philosophy classroom requires that students exercise the virtue of patient persistence.\n\nPhilosophy is amazing, amazing in much the same way that pure mathematics is amazing. Amazing that human beings should be so created as to be capable of purely abstract thought, thought not aimed at achieving some practical goal. When introducing students to philosophy, I would every now and then stop and invite amazement at the astounding intellectual creativity represented by Plato, by Augustine, by Descartes, by Kant \u2013 by the whole long line of philosophers. We are the product not just of evolution but of creation. Be amazed.\n\nThe flourishing of the philosophy classroom requires that its members exercise the virtue of amazement.\n\n* * *\n\nThere are, of course, a good many other virtues required for the flourishing of the philosophy classroom; the virtue of attentiveness is one that comes to mind. The virtues I have mentioned are those I found, when I was teaching philosophy, that I had to cultivate in my students, and myself to practice, if my students were to genuinely engage the material \u2013 if they were to begin to think philosophically and enjoy doing so. Lack of attentiveness was not then a significant problem. I gather from talking to friends that it has become a problem: students nowadays are distracted by the devices of various sorts that they bring to class. Instead of paying attention to what is being taught, they are texting and being texted. The flourishing of the philosophy classroom requires that students be attentive to what is being taught.\n\nI mentioned at the beginning of this essay that the virtues I would mention are relevant not just to the philosophy classroom but to other academic situations as well.\n\nMost of them are relevant to classrooms in subjects other than philosophy \u2013 intellectual humility is an obvious example of such a virtue, as is respect. One that is easy to overlook is the virtue of amazement. I noted that the intellectual creativity represented by the works of the great philosophers is amazing \u2013 truly amazing. But so too is the creativity represented by the works of the great poets, the great composers, the great sociologists, the great natural scientists, the great mathematicians; it\u2019s all amazing. Yet more amazing, far more amazing, is the immensity, intricacy, and lawfulness of God\u2019s creation. It is my conviction that something is seriously deficient if professors and students do not, every now and then, stop in amazement.\n\nAnd when it is some segment of history that they are studying, if they do not, every now and then, experience horror at what human beings have done to human beings, and to the natural world. Amazement and horror.\n\n* * *\n\nThe exercise of multiple virtues is also required for the flourishing of situations in which scholars interact with other scholars: academic conferences, lectures, and symposia, the supervision of research, the refereeing of books and articles, the funding of research, the award of prizes, faculty meetings and departmental leadership, etc. Let me mention two virtues that are of prime importance in such situations; I leave it to the reader to identify others.\n\nI noted that a significant feature of a typical college or university classroom is the discrepancy of institutional authority and intellectual standing between professor and students; professors have an authority in the classroom, and an intellectual standing, that the students lack. A similar discrepancy is present in many situations in which scholars interact with other scholars \u2013 especially older, well-established scholars with young scholars. Here, too, the discrepancy is all-too-often abused. Older scholars put down young scholars, demean them, treat their work dismissively, sometimes bully them \u2013 often because they feel themselves threatened. What is lacking in such situations is respect.\n\nWhat also calls for mention here is what historians are increasingly bringing to light, namely, situations in which white scholars have treated scholars of color with disrespect, and situations in which male scholars have treated women scholars with disrespect. I am writing these words on Tuesday, October 3, 2023. In this morning\u2019s New York Times, there is a story of the important contribution of Lise Meitner, in the 1930s, to the understanding of how uranium behaves under bombardment by neutrons. The work of her male associates gained public recognition; hers was scrubbed from the record.\n\nWillingness to acknowledge that one is mistaken, and that there are things one doesn\u2019t know, is as important in situations where scholars interact with scholars as it is in the classroom. I am thinking here of a well-known philosopher, who will go unnamed, whom I have often heard lecture and with whom I have participated in a number of symposia. I have never heard him concede a critical point. Invariably, when someone offers an objection to something he said, he becomes defensive and concedes nothing. I have often found myself amazed at his ingenuity at evading the force of an objection. It goes without saying that this lack of intellectual humility inhibits the flourishing of the discussion.\n\n* * *\n\nRespect and intellectual humility: I trust that my highlighting of the importance of these virtues for the flourishing of interactions among scholars will stimulate readers to identify other such virtues.\n\nAdams, Robert, A Theory of Virtue: Excellence in Being for the Good\n\nAlong with the work of Jennifer Herdt, this is one of the best comprehensive discussions of the nature and importance of virtue.\n\nWolterstorff, Nicholas, Educating for Responsible Action\n\nA survey, now somewhat dated, of the psychological literature on the formation of virtues.",

That meant that I had to cope, somehow, with the attitudes that hindered genuine engagement \u2013 cope with the arrogance of the arrogant, the timidity of the timid, the worries of the worried, the rigidity of the rigid, the resentment of the resentful. I had to do what I could to cultivate in my students various virtues, and myself to practice various virtues, with the goal of creating a flourishing community of philosophical inquiry.</p>\n<p>Let me mention, in no particular order, some the virtues that I tried to cultivate in my students and myself to practice, without asking whether they are to be classified as moral virtues, intellectual virtues, or whatever. While the virtues I will mention are essential to the flourishing of the philosophy classroom, they are relevant in other academic situations as well: to classrooms in subjects other than philosophy, to academic lectures, conferences, and symposia, to the refereeing of books and articles, to faculty meetings. Accordingly, after highlighting their relevance to the philosophy classroom I will point to a few of the other situations in which they are relevant.</p>\n<h2>Virtues in the Philosophy Classroom</h2>\n<h3><strong>The virtue of respect</strong>\u00a0</h3>\n<p>In any college or university classroom, the professor has a position of institutional authority that the students do not have: he or she is \u201cin charge.\u201d And in an introductory philosophy course, the professor possesses an intellectual standing that the students do not possess: he or she already knows the subject matter.</p>\n<p>It\u2019s all-too-easy for professors to abuse this disparity in authority and standing: by suggesting that the question a student asked is a dumb question, by shrugging off complaints that the assignment was not clear or the exam not fair, by exhibiting favor for some and disfavor for others, by putting down any student who voices disagreement with something one said, by humiliating those who have not completed the assignment. All of these are ways of treating one\u2019s students with disrespect. Multiple are the ways in which professors can and do abuse their position of institutional authority and superior intellectual standing by treating students with disrespect</p>\n<p>Of course, students can and do also treat professors with disrespect. And students can and do treat each other with disrespect. The flourishing of the philosophy classroom \u2013 indeed, of any classroom \u2013 requires that the participants practice the virtue of respect with regard to each other.</p>\n<p>The respect called for on the part of those in the classroom extends to those not in the classroom. It was an episode that occurred late in my teaching career that brought this point forcefully to mind; I should have taken note of it long before. In a session of a seminar devoted to discussing one of Augustine\u2019s writings, one of the students made an utterly dismissive comment about something Augustine had written. I was annoyed, and blurted out, \u201cWould you have said what you just said if Augustine were sitting across the table from you?\u201d \u201cOf course not,\u201d she said. Point made. It is incumbent on us in the classroom to treat with due respect those whose works we are studying.</p>\n<p>A different, but related, point is the following. Every now and then I discerned that a student found it difficult to separate disagreement from personal attack; when a fellow student expressed disagreement with something they said, they viewed that as an attack on them personally. They felt that they had been demeaned, treated with disrespect. They looked crushed; on occasion, they wiped away tears. So after the class I would make a point of taking them aside and explaining that, in philosophy, it\u2019s essential that we not interpret disagreement as personal attack. Almost always what turned up in the course of my talk with them is that they had been reared in a subculture that pervasively interpreted disagreement as personal attack. Of course, sometimes the student who voiced the disagreement did so in a dismissive disrespectful way; then I had to speak afterwards to that student.</p>\n<p>Philosophy is impossible when disagreement is interpreted, or conducted, as personal attack; philosophy lives on respectful disagreement. Consensus would kill it off.</p>\n<p>To treat someone with due respect is to treat them justly. The flourishing of the philosophy classroom requires that its members exercise the virtue of justice with respect to each other.</p>\n<h3>The virtue of tolerance for other world-and-life views</h3>\n<p>A dimension of respect that deserves separate mention is the virtue of tolerance for other world-and-life views.</p>\n<p>Students enter the philosophy classroom with a variety of different views on life and the world, including the social world, views shaped by their upbringing, their experience, their own attempts at finding meaning, etc. Insofar as these diverse world-and-life views find expression in the philosophy classroom, the flourishing of the classroom requires that they be treated with respect \u2013 unless, perchance, someone\u2019s world-and-life view incorporates the tenet that certain members of the class are to be treated with disdain because of their race, their ethnicity, their religion, or whatever. Believers are to treat unbelievers with respect, and vice versa, political conservatives are to treat political liberals with respect, and vice versa, mainline Christians are to treat evangelicals with respect, and vice versa.</p>\n<p>The flourishing of the philosophy classroom requires that its members practice the virtue of tolerance for the world-and-life views of their fellow members.</p>\n<h3>The virtue of intellectual humility</h3>\n<p>Intellectual humility consists of being willing to acknowledge that some of one beliefs are mistaken, and that there are things one doesn\u2019t know on the topic under discussion. Intellectual arrogance is the opposite. The intellectually arrogant person digs in his heels, insists that he is right, insists that he has nothing to learn. The flourishing of the philosophy classroom requires that its members \u2013 including the professor \u2013 practice the virtue of intellectual humility.</p>\n<h3><strong>The virtue of bafflement</strong>\u00a0</h3>\n<p>Aristotle wrote that philosophy arises out of wonder. Sometimes it does; but mostly, I think, it arises out of bafflement. Reality is mysterious, elusive. I want to understand something, but I don\u2019t understand it; so I am baffled, perplexed. I want, for example, to understand the basis of moral obligation, but I don\u2019t understand it; I am baffled. So I set about trying to dispel my bafflement. I read what philosophers have written on the topic; I think for myself. Eventually, if all goes well, I experience the delight of understanding. Philosophy lives on bafflement and on release from bafflement: being baffled by something one wants to understand but doesn\u2019t, and then coming to understand. The student who has no interest in understanding the basis of obligation, and hence experiences no bafflement on the matter, will find a course in philosophical ethics a crashing bore.</p>\n<p>The flourishing of the philosophy classroom requires that students exercise the virtue of bafflement.</p>\n<h3>The virtue of patient persistence</h3>\n<p>Some students take to philosophy like a duck to water; that was true in my case. But many find philosophical discourse strange. Questions are posed that it never occurred to them to ask: Do numbers exist? Do properties exist? What is justice? Strange questions. What motivates such strange questions? And how does one go about answering them? Do they even have answers?</p>\n<p>So every now and then I would offer reassurance and urge patience. You may find philosophy strange. But hang in there; you\u2019ll catch on, I assure you. Eventually you may even find yourself enjoying this novel way of thinking. Many students before you have.</p>\n<p>The flourishing of the philosophy classroom requires that students exercise the virtue of patient persistence.</p>\n<h3><strong>The virtue of amazement</strong>\u00a0</h3>\n<p>Philosophy is amazing, amazing in much the same way that pure mathematics is amazing. Amazing that human beings should be so created as to be capable of purely abstract thought, thought not aimed at achieving some practical goal. When introducing students to philosophy, I would every now and then stop and invite amazement at the astounding intellectual creativity represented by Plato, by Augustine, by Descartes, by Kant \u2013 by the whole long line of philosophers. We are the product not just of evolution but of creation.<em> </em>Be amazed.</p>\n<p>The flourishing of the philosophy classroom requires that its members exercise the virtue of amazement.</p>\n<p class=\"text-align-center\">* * *</p>\n<p>There are, of course, a good many other virtues required for the flourishing of the philosophy classroom; the virtue of attentiveness is one that comes to mind. The virtues I have mentioned are those I found, when I was teaching philosophy, that I had to cultivate in my students, and myself to practice, if my students were to genuinely engage the material \u2013 if they were to begin to think philosophically and enjoy doing so. Lack of attentiveness was not then a significant problem. I gather from talking to friends that it has become a problem: students nowadays are distracted by the devices of various sorts that they bring to class. Instead of paying attention to what is being taught, they are texting and being texted. The flourishing of the philosophy classroom requires that students be attentive to what is being taught.</p>\n<h2>Part Two: Virtues in Other Academic Settings</h2>\n<p>I mentioned at the beginning of this essay that the virtues I would mention are relevant not just to the philosophy classroom but to other academic situations as well.</p>\n<p>Most of them are relevant to classrooms in subjects other than philosophy \u2013 intellectual humility is an obvious example of such a virtue, as is respect. One that is easy to overlook is the virtue of amazement. I noted that the intellectual creativity represented by the works of the great philosophers is amazing \u2013 truly amazing. But so too is the creativity represented by the works of the great poets, the great composers, the great sociologists, the great natural scientists, the great mathematicians; it\u2019s all amazing. Yet more amazing, far more amazing, is the immensity, intricacy, and lawfulness of God\u2019s creation. It is my conviction that something is seriously deficient if professors and students do not, every now and then, stop in amazement.</p>\n<p>And when it is some segment of history that they are studying, if they do not, every now and then, experience horror at what human beings have done to human beings, and to the natural world. Amazement and horror.</p>\n<p class=\"text-align-center\">* * *</p>\n<p>The exercise of multiple virtues is also required for the flourishing of situations in which scholars interact with other scholars: academic conferences, lectures, and symposia, the supervision of research, the refereeing of books and articles, the funding of research, the award of prizes, faculty meetings and departmental leadership, etc. Let me mention two virtues that are of prime importance in such situations; I leave it to the reader to identify others.</p>\n<h3>The virtue of respect</h3>\n<p>I noted that a significant feature of a typical college or university classroom is the discrepancy of institutional authority and intellectual standing between professor and students; professors have an authority in the classroom, and an intellectual standing, that the students lack. A similar discrepancy is present in many situations in which scholars interact with other scholars \u2013 especially older, well-established scholars with young scholars. Here, too, the discrepancy is all-too-often abused. Older scholars put down young scholars, demean them, treat their work dismissively, sometimes bully them \u2013 often because they feel themselves threatened. What is lacking in such situations is respect.</p>\n<p>What also calls for mention here is what historians are increasingly bringing to light, namely, situations in which white scholars have treated scholars of color with disrespect, and situations in which male scholars have treated women scholars with disrespect. I am writing these words on Tuesday, October 3, 2023. In this morning\u2019s <em>New York Times, </em>there is a story of the important contribution of Lise Meitner, in the 1930s, to the understanding of how uranium behaves under bombardment by neutrons. The work of her male associates gained public recognition; hers was scrubbed from the record.</p>\n<h3>The virtue of intellectual humility</h3>\n<p>Willingness to acknowledge that one is mistaken, and that there are things one doesn\u2019t know, is as important in situations where scholars interact with scholars as it is in the classroom. I am thinking here of a well-known philosopher, who will go unnamed, whom I have often heard lecture and with whom I have participated in a number of symposia. I have never heard him concede a critical point. Invariably, when someone offers an objection to something he said, he becomes defensive and concedes nothing. I have often found myself amazed at his ingenuity at evading the force of an objection. It goes without saying that this lack of intellectual humility inhibits the flourishing of the discussion.</p>\n<p class=\"text-align-center\">* * *</p>\n<p>Respect and intellectual humility: I trust that my highlighting of the importance of these virtues for the flourishing of interactions among scholars will stimulate readers to identify other such virtues.</p>\n<h2 class=\"new_page\">Further Reading</h2>\n<p>Adams, Robert, <em>A Theory of Virtue: Excellence in Being for the Good</em></p>\n<p>Along with the work of Jennifer Herdt, this is one of the best comprehensive discussions of the nature and importance of virtue.</p>\n<p>Wolterstorff, Nicholas, <em>Educating for Responsible Action</em></p>\n<p>A survey, now somewhat dated, of the psychological literature on the formation of virtues.</p>"

    "bodyText": "Since 2005 I have been engaged in empirical research on struggles for basic legal freedoms in China. At the intersection of sociology, law and politics, this research has ranged across many of China\u2019s cities and provinces. It has included hundreds of interviews, analysis of media and online materials inside China, interviews with international human rights groups, foreign governments, and analysis of international media (Liu and Halliday 2016). At the core of this research was a fundamental question that I had been pursuing with many other specialists on law and the politics of lawyers across the world since the 17 th century: what role have lawyers played in struggles for political liberalism, viz., in their terms, for political societies in which there is protection for basic legal freedoms, construction and defense of an open civil society, together with moderation of executive power in the state, often through balance of powers or constitutional limits on rulers (Halliday and Karpik 1997; Halliday, Karpik and Feeley 2007; Halliday, Karpik and Feeley 2012)?\n\nAs our China research progressed, I was drawn inside a circle of China\u2019s leading human rights lawyers, many of whom I came to learn were Christians. In repeated crackdowns, from 2008, 2011, and most dramatically in 2015, almost all these lawyers have suffered deeply. They have lost jobs and lost careers, been detained and \u201cdisappeared,\u201d tortured and imprisoned, subject to hardship for their families, been forced to move at the arbitrary whim of security police, forced into exile, or forbidden to leave the country, because they continued to fight for human and legal rights, rule of law and a constitutional order.\n\nIn this essay I explore tentatively how the lens of Christian virtues, and most especially those of courage and prudence or practical wisdom, might provide insight into the struggles of China\u2019s notable rights lawyers for a new New China. I proceed through four steps. First, who are these lawyers, what is their cause, and what price have they paid for their activism? Second, how does a Christian concept of courage intersect with conventional social science understandings? Third, can we observe the Christian virtue of prudence in lawyers\u2019 encounters with a regime built upon vice? And, fourth, is the theological power of a Christian virtues\u2019 approach, as it is reflected in China\u2019s Christian rights\u2019 community, amplified by attributing vices and virtues not only to individuals, but to collective actors\u2014organizations, businesses, professions, and communities, among others. In each of these steps I raise more questions than offer definitive answers.\n\nFrom the early 2000s in mainland China, a small number of activist lawyers emerged, sometimes called rights or weiquan lawyers (Fu and Cullen 2011). They spearheaded legal approaches to China\u2019s most intractable problems. Numbering only a few hundred at their peak, these lawyers took on cases highly sensitive to the government, including land takings, religious persecution, environmental hazards, abuse of women, ill treatment of migrant workers, among others, issues involving hundreds of millions of Chinese citizens.\n\nBecause these issues sometimes threatened local social stability, and, more fundamentally, the reputation and legitimacy of the Party, it became dangerous work for rights lawyers. The Chinese Communist Party (CCP) readily imagined the prospect of an Eastern Europe-type \u201cColor Revolution\u201d or a \u201cJasmine Revolution\u201d in the wake of North Africa\u2019s Arab Spring uprisings. Whether they were headline legal disputes, or using courts as a stage to activate publics, or causes c\u00e9l\u00e8bres that could light up the internet, or an explosion of stories on social media\u2014any might be the spark that enflamed a forest fire which ultimately might bring down the CCP\u2019s control of China\u2019s state, conventionally labeled the Party-state.\n\nThe periodic crackdowns on lawyers unfolded through warnings, detentions, \u201cdisappearances\u201d where lawyers simply could not be traced for months at a time, psychological and physical torture, and prison sentences. Between crackdowns lawyers would be pressured not to take cases or withdraw from them, threatened with loss of their practice licenses, placed under various levels of surveillance by the security apparatus, and even accosted physically by the \u201cblack mafia\u201d under government direction. Since 2008, the sufferings of these activist and defense lawyers reached worldwide audiences through the international media, international human rights groups, and foreign governments, including the European Union and United States (Liu and Halliday, 2017: 157-67).\n\nSociologically, it can be seen why the Party-state, and its five systems of coercive control, [\u00a01\u00a0] fear this relative handful of lawyers, even though they represent a tiny fraction of the hundreds of thousands in a legal profession that has exploded since 2000. The notable activists, as we labeled them (Liu and Halliday 2015: chapter 1), projected ideals that fundamentally challenged the monopoly over power by the Party.\n\nSurprisingly, our research discovered that a significant proportion of these several hundred rights lawyers, perhaps forty percent at one point, have been Protestant Christians. That in itself presented a further danger to the Party since these lawyers were also committed to another ideology counter to the official Party line. Inside China they were closely connected to China\u2019s largest civil society formation\u2014unofficial Protestant churches, and sometimes official Three-Self and sometimes Roman Catholic churches. These connections posed a threat to the Party and its security apparatus\u2014estimated by some to be a larger line of government expenditure than its entire military budget. Moreover, the connections that Christian lawyers had forged with Christian churches and organizations worldwide gave them spokespersons, defenders and enablers outside of China and beyond control of the Party.\n\nOur sociological account of courage proposed that lawyers\u2019 fortitude was generated and sustained by three factors: lawyers\u2019 life experiences; their secular and religious beliefs; and sustained support from inside and outside China (Liu and Halliday 2015:chapter 5). How might a theological ethics of the virtues amplify or inform a social science analysis?\n\nHerdt (2013) helpfully contrasts Aristotle\u2019s concept of courage with that of Thomas Aquinas. In so doing she brings a Christian orientation much closer to the empirical reality of China\u2019s rights lawyers. For Aristotle, courage was exemplified on the battlefield, \u201climited to those who face death in battle.\u201d It thereby was restricted to the very few and animated by \u201csome good that transcends their lives and is thus honored by the community\u201d (Herdt 2013:110-12). For Aquinas, the meek submission of Christ to death on the cross presents a radical contrast in courage. This bold virtue now can be exemplified by all: \u201ceven those living a humdrum ordinary existence can have opportunities for genuine courage,\u201d even to its ultimate expression in martyrdom (Herdt 2013:122). The seemingly ordinary person exemplifies courage when s/he faces persecution and suffering for their faith and its expression in his or her persistent efforts to bring about a common good that \u201cstands firm in truth and justice\u201d (Herdt 2013:125).\n\nMany of China\u2019s Christian lawyers affirm that their activism is underwritten by ideals of charity (Halliday 2021). Their conviction about God\u2019s enduring love for them drives them to express that love for those far beyond their intimate circles of family or locality, indeed, out to other religions or even members of the CCP itself. In the contest with evil, in confrontations with persecutors, the Christian stays the course, fights the good fight, armed with this gift of the Holy Spirit, a \u201cconfidence that all dangers will be finally overcome, not just that they may be endured\u201d (Herdt 2013:126). The most resilient of the Christian rights lawyers would resonate with the affirmation of the Catechism of the Catholic Church that courage in the guise of fortitude reveals itself as \u201cthe moral virtue that ensures firmness in difficulties and constancy in the pursuit of good (Pinsent 2017).\u201d Or, in their moments of greatest stress, they would express the hope that not only could they exercise courage of \u201cthe kind that faces danger,\u201d but they might maintain the fortitude that \u201csticks at it under pain\u201d when so many have experienced excruciating physical and psychological torture (Lewis 1952:62).\n\nYet, courage has its limits. When confronted with the loss of livelihood, poverty, public disgrace, torture, disappearance, long prison sentences, for some rights\u2019 lawyers fortitude weakened and courage crumbled. It is not a virtue that can be taken for granted, nor indeed confidently predicted when the pain becomes unbearable. Some have counted the struggle too painful and have walked away from it.\n\nThese characterizations of courage and fortitude resonate immediately in the context of China\u2019s rights struggles. There is a manifest struggle within China where the great majority of the lawyer vanguard are not great personages, eminent academics, or conventional notables in great law firms, but ordinary lawyers, frequently of humble backgrounds, who become extraordinary by their refusal to ignore the terrible harms being done by the Party to hundreds of millions of China\u2019s people (Halliday, Zilberstein, Espeland 2021), and by their persistent commitment to fight with whatever weapons of the weak that come to hand.\n\nTheir fight has taken place on many fronts. They have taken on some of the most widely publicized cases: where a mother was arrested for her protests over failure to hold a high school principal accountable for raping her daughter; when hundreds of villagers protested, many subsequently arrested, because their seaside land was arbitrarily taken from them; when babies suffered and died because a baby formula manufacturer adulterated the \u201cmilk\u201d; when religious believers had their places of worship destroyed or their leaders arrested; among many others.\n\nOften cases morphed into public information campaigns as bloggers, lawyers, and netizens stirred up protests at manifest injustices, cruelties, and government indifference. On occasion they took the form of public theater, when defense lawyers attracted media attention by dramatic acts or banners on the steps of courtrooms. In a country where civil society and public discourse was in its infancy, these lawyers essentially became spokespersons for publics. After the country-wide 709 Crackdown, beginning on 9 July 2015, profiles of courage shifted within China and in the international media as outspoken wives of the disappeared and imprisoned lawyers, notably Christians Wang Qiaoling and Li Wenzu, led protests on behalf of their husbands.\n\nUnderstandings of courage in the long Christian tradition help explain more convincingly why the Christian lawyers maintain the struggle. Even if they do not themselves know well the tradition, they recognize that courage can be expressed by the outsider, by those with less prestigious educational qualifications, by those who grew up in poorer provinces, and by those who rise out of family poverty. Those few who gave up comfortable practices in commercial and civil law for criminal and rights defense heed the pull of a deeper calling to defend the weak and bring about a just society. For the Christian lawyers, this courage is animated by the theological virtues of faith, hope and charity, as they openly expressed in my fieldwork (Halliday 2021).\n\nMoreover, for the Christians in particular a virtues\u2019 approach helps explain the puzzle of why a hard core of these lawyers keep on fighting on year after year, crackdown after crackdown, suffering piled upon suffering. Many have been urged by their spouses or parents and friends to desist, to give up and shift to safer arenas of legal practice. In these particularly difficult times, as Xi Jinping has deepened his assault on rule of law and lawyers, some still refuse to surrender. In the face of everyday persecution and relentless and intrusive surveillance, they persist. Other notable lawyers and legal academics come anew to the Christan faith.\n\nI conclude that in addition to legal or political or personal ideals that motivate China\u2019s rights lawyers to continue the struggle, the Christian lawyers have another source of resolve, a spiritual source, not only as a mystery of faith, but as it is expressed in community, both within China and across the church universal. 709 activist Wang Qiaoling explains that both the courage of the 709 wives and the Christian 709 lawyers are continuously permeated by their sense of God\u2019s presence, a confidence in God\u2019s leading, a diffuse sense that God is working through them for the hope of a transformed China.\n\nThis courage is embedded and fortified in community. The Christian lawyers in Beijing met frequently over meals to discuss cases and to maintain solidarity. They earlier were knit together in a nation-wide online network. They joined together in teams for particular cases. After 709 many of the families were knit together into a supportive community thanks to the indefatigable efforts of resolute wives.\n\nAt its extreme, Christian courage confronts violent death. A striking image of martyrdom, even in contemporary China, has imprinted itself on my mind. Reflecting Nero\u2019s horrific parade of martyred crucified Christians lining the road to Rome, a drawing some years ago pictured Christians on crosses lining a metaphorical winding road to Tiananmen Square and the entrance to the Heavenly City where China\u2019s leaders since Mao have appeared before the masses. A Christian rights lawyer, nailed to a cross, is readily identifiable. Here again the present-day suffering of China\u2019s Christian rights lawyers is grafted symbolically into the millenia-long tradition of Christians obedient unto death.\n\nThe cardinal virtue of prudence, or practical wisdom, seems dim in its contrast to the blaze of courage. It is equally opaque to many Christians and manifestly absent in explicit terms from my fieldwork with China\u2019s Christian rights lawyers. Yet they speak constantly of a kind of practical wisdom that is integral to their practice as lawyers, their livelihoods, and their wellbeing\u2014even their freedom and, in extremis , their lives.\n\nThese abstract ideals, however, do not readily convert into a wise decision about how to act in a given situation. For these, there must be deliberation, as a person comprehends the particularities of the current situation, judgment, as a person decides how and when to act, and action itself, as a person carries it out more or less perfectly or competently in practice (Wood 2014:45-7). \u201cPrudence at work,\u201d then, for the Christian human rights defender, manifests a transcendence that is more than tactics or cunning (Wood 2014: 41-44).\n\nFor the Christian, as I understand it, the necessity for practical wisdom lies in the fit between high level moral norms about how we should behave\u2014the master ethical standards of our faith\u2014and the vast number of everyday circumstances where those norms must be applied (Wood 2014). Since a system of rules for action could not possibly be comprehensive and detailed enough to meet every contingency in every moment in every situation, the \u201cthe virtue of knowing the next step to take,\u201d and \u201cwhat we should do in each situation,\u201d becomes of the utmost importance (Herdt 2017:17). This is particularly challenging when the powers of evil, the Chinese Communist Party, the Party-state, and its security apparatuses, deliberately create uncertainties about what actions at what moments will be in their red zone, and thus almost certainly ensure a quick punitive responses, and what are in their grey zones, and thus may be tolerated for the moment.\n\nHow can we understand practical wisdom theologically in ways that enrich empirical data on skills, intuitions, tactics commonly discussed by lawyers who live in twilight zones of danger and risk?\n\nOver many years of fieldwork and hundreds of interviews, rights defense lawyers reveal a plethora of questions and decisions they make about ways to maintain courage without the losses to practice, livelihood, comfortable living, or even life, which exist as tangible threats always on their minds.\n\nWhen a lawyer is told by the Justice Bureau to walk away from a case, should s/he? When judges refuse to hear a witness or enter evidence, should the lawyer rouse the public to pressure the judges? When pressured by a prosecutor or judges to \u201charmonize\u201d or settle a contentious case prematurely, should they? How far should they adopt the tactics of extreme proceduralism\u2014so-called die-hard tactics\u2014to tie up a court whose judges are acting in a hostile manner? When should a lawyer accept a case without payment or costs? When should a lawyer accept moneys from overseas, whether for a case, or personal support, or for an NGO? When should lawyers gather together in fraught times? Should a lawyer refuse to answer her/his phone when repeatedly contacted by public or state security? During harsh interrogation, should a captive lawyer implicate friends and colleagues?\n\nAt the outset, it can appear that courage and prudence stand in some degree of tension. At one pole an excess of courage can lead to impetuousness, excessive risk-taking, recklessness, unconstrained impulses of anger or frustration, visceral outbursts, negligence or rashness (Wood 2014:37-8, 47-8). For instance, Gao Zhisheng, among the most incorrigible and relentlessly persecuted Christian lawyers, has been criticized by an eminent international authority on China\u2019s laws because Gao kept on speaking out about the manifest injustices of his incarceration even though his outspokenness ensured harsher treatment, and possibly death (Gao 2017). What good does it do, asked the international authority, if Gao disappears into a Chinese grave and his voice is silenced?\n\nPrudence has dangers of too little or too much. Too little, and persons act rashly, with harsh even fatal consequences; too much, and persons act timidly, letting down not only their clients and cause, but the reputation of Christians and the faith itself. For instance, a rights\u2019 lawyer is asked to take on a case where the detained or arrested person is a member of Falun Gong, a brutally repressed quasi-religious movement whose members have been killed and imprisoned in the thousands, since Falun Gong boldly surrounded Zhonghanhai, the walled residential and office heartland of China\u2019s rulers, adjacent to the Heavenly City and Tiananmen Square. The risks are high. Falun Gong has been classified as an \u201cevil cult.\u201d To take on Falun Gong cases risks harassment for the lawyer from the local Justice Bureau, pressure on law firms to withdraw from a case, black marks that can affect renewal of an annual lawyer\u2019s license, and thereby the lawyer\u2019s livelihood. Yet the boldest of rights\u2019 lawyers once hailed peers who dared to take such cases as the pinnacle of rights defense in China. Christian lawyers can see this stand for a religious group as a public display of Christian charity in the face of savage injustice.\n\nOr consider the decision of Li Heping, a leader of Christian rights lawyers in the 2000s, to \u201cstep back from the front line\u201d of representing clients in \u201csensitive cases\u201d and to focus on NGO activities against torture in China. After being badly tortured himself during detention in the 2008 crackdown, Li Heping judged that anti-torture activities would be less sensitive for the security apparatus. Alas, when arrested and \u201cdisappeared\u201d for many months in the nationwide 709 Crackdown in 2015, Li Heping learned under interrogation that the security apparatus considered his anti-torture campaign, with its international connections, to be a threat to the Party.\n\nRepeatedly in my fieldwork, I witnessed or was told of lawyers\u2019 perpetual challenge to stay the course in acts of courage, yet without going either to the extreme of full retreat from their rights representation or to the extreme of actions so provocative that they almost certainly would lead to severe repercussions. Their lives were repeatedly punctuated with judgments about which actions, in the present moment and in view of a lawyer\u2019s earlier encounters with public and state security, could or should not be undertaken.\n\nIntegrating practical wisdom into our understanding of the rights struggle may therefore yield a double benefit.\n\nFirst, from a conventional social science vantage-point, we can see that the rights struggle for the Christian lawyers is more than a professional obligation and calling, more than an outworking of their inward sense that the weak must be defended and the strong be held accountable. It goes beyond intuitive or juridical ideals of justice, or the codification of justice in constitutionalism or rule of law ideals and institutions. The lens of practical wisdom brings what might be seen as a transient particular case into a cosmic moral order, into the sphere of entangling with principalities and powers.\n\nSecond, for the Christian lawyers themselves, a deeper awareness of Christian thought, as it has been elaborated through countless instances of persecution and suffering in the history of the church, might add to their armory of faith. It solidifies fortitude. It lifts a worldly struggle into something transcendent. It takes a trial of this moment and situates it in a trajectory that reaches through the long history of the faith to beyond time.\n\nDespite the evidence that rights lawyers are constantly making judgments about how to act in a given risky moment, I recognize that I am as yet seeing through a glass darkly when I seek to grasp what is the distinctive understanding that is yielded by the Christian ethical attribute of prudence. Is it that the Christian is consciously or diffusely always weighing the action in this current situation in relation to the high ideals of faith and the call to courage? Is the Christian gaining an increment of courage, or a refinement of judgment, because they seek to be faithful to the ideals of justice? Is it that the Christian\u2019s decisions to act are driven by the motivations of love or mercy or compassion rather than social ideals, fear or fame? Compared to non-Christian lawyers and rights activists who face risk with experience, discernment and refined judgment, does the Christian activist act prudently in discernibly distinctive ways? Professor Herdt opens up a new angle of orientation to rights struggles in China and far beyond.\n\nA partial answer to the question of Christian virtues in a contemporary rights struggle may be found in rights\u2019 lawyers embeddedness in community. And this brings me to a puzzle in the Christian scholarship on virtues in theological ethics.\n\nHere I propose that the community of rights\u2019 lawyers in China, and in particular that community of Christian lawyers within the wider community, can be seen as a carrier of courage or prudence. China\u2019s Christian rights lawyers have been more than a bundle of individuals, or a network of contacts. They have understood themselves to be in fellowship. They share religious beliefs. They work in teams. They \u201cbreak bread\u201d together.\n\nIn these respects, as social scientists put it, the community of human rights lawyers in China is an emergent social group. True, the virtues of individuals influence the community as a whole. True, the community influences the lawyers within it. But more than that, communities themselves have properties of virtue or vice. Virtues are a constitutive part of the Christian rights community. In community they join together to talk through all the dangers and contingencies of practice, in effect, balancing the impetus to courage with the wisdom of prudence. Indeed, we may properly depict the determination of the Christian rights\u2019 lawyers to stay connected, despite the efforts to isolate them, as a collective act, an act of corporate courage. And we can well comprehend their judgments about more or less risky behavior as a collective attribute of prudence. Going out of Beijing or lying low during high profile political events in Beijing is one example. Joining high profile trials as a team, and showing solidarity in numbers, is another. Avoiding direct verbal attacks in public or the social media on the CCP or on Chairman Xi Jinping is yet another. Of course, there is variation within the group and there are those step outside the community to act in another way. A core of practical wisdom, however, centers the community and places bounds around an excess of courage.\n\nAgainst that community of virtue stands a community of vice\u2014the institution of the Chinese Communist Party\u2014which repudiates the Christian virtues of love, justice, temperance, among others. The Christian community depicts the CCP as much more than a conglomeration of Party members. It embodies and propagates vices explicitly at odds with those of the Christian virtues, not least with its addiction to power. Any kind of cruelty is acceptable if it will sustain the Party\u2019s control of China\u2019s state and society, its cultivation of avarice and nationalism.\n\nWe may then speak of a virtuous community. It has a shared ethos of what constitutes courage and the circumstances in which practical wisdom tempers and modifies expressions of courage. This community stands in sharp counterpoint to the institutions of vice which confront it in an enduring struggle over ideals and practices. The density of lawyer networks, their proclivities for working in teams, their connections online and through shared meals melded together in a community which held beliefs in common and which exemplified courage and prudence in the pursuit of justice in deeply unjust society.\n\nFu, Hualing, and Richard Cullen. 2011. \"Climbing the Weiquan Ladder: A Radicalizing Process for Rights-Protection Lawyers.\" The China Quarterly 205:40-59.\n\nGao, Zhisheng. 2017.

    "bodyHtml": "<p>Since 2005 I have been engaged in empirical research on struggles for basic legal freedoms in China. At the intersection of sociology, law and politics, this research has ranged across many of China\u2019s cities and provinces. It has included hundreds of interviews, analysis of media and online materials inside China, interviews with international human rights groups, foreign governments, and analysis of international media (Liu and Halliday 2016). At the core of this research was a fundamental question that I had been pursuing with many other specialists on law and the politics of lawyers across the world since the 17<sup>th</sup> century: what role have lawyers played in struggles for political liberalism, viz., in their terms, for political societies in which there is protection for basic legal freedoms, construction and defense of an open civil society, together with moderation of executive power in the state, often through balance of powers or constitutional limits on rulers (Halliday and Karpik 1997; Halliday, Karpik and Feeley 2007; Halliday, Karpik and Feeley 2012)?</p>\n<p>As our China research progressed, I was drawn inside a circle of China\u2019s leading human rights lawyers, many of whom I came to learn were Christians. In repeated crackdowns, from 2008, 2011, and most dramatically in 2015, almost all these lawyers have suffered deeply. They have lost jobs and lost careers, been detained and \u201cdisappeared,\u201d tortured and imprisoned, subject to hardship for their families, been forced to move at the arbitrary whim of security police, forced into exile, or forbidden to leave the country, because they continued to fight for human and legal rights, rule of law and a constitutional order.</p>\n<p>We have written a good deal on these lawyers and their fight for basic legal freedoms, all from within scholarly frames in the sociologies of law and professions. Jennifer Herdt\u2019s <a href=\"https://globalfacultyinitiative.net/content_item/389\">Theology Brief on The Virtues</a> presses me to revisit my social science research and writings from a fresh angle.</p>\n<p>In this essay I explore tentatively how the lens of Christian virtues, and most especially those of courage and prudence or practical wisdom, might provide insight into the struggles of China\u2019s notable rights lawyers for a new New China. I proceed through four steps. First, who are these lawyers, what is their cause, and what price have they paid for their activism? Second, how does a Christian concept of courage intersect with conventional social science understandings? Third, can we observe the Christian virtue of prudence in lawyers\u2019 encounters with a regime built upon vice? And, fourth, is the theological power of a Christian virtues\u2019 approach, as it is reflected in China\u2019s Christian rights\u2019 community, amplified by attributing vices and virtues not only to individuals, but to collective actors\u2014organizations, businesses, professions, and communities, among others. In each of these steps I raise more questions than offer definitive answers.</p>\n<h2>Who Are China\u2019s Rights Lawyers?</h2>\n<p>From the early 2000s in mainland China, a small number of activist lawyers emerged, sometimes called rights or <em>weiquan </em>lawyers (Fu and Cullen 2011). They spearheaded legal approaches to China\u2019s most intractable problems. Numbering only a few hundred at their peak, these lawyers took on cases highly sensitive to the government, including land takings, religious persecution, environmental hazards, abuse of women, ill treatment of migrant workers, among others, issues involving hundreds of millions of Chinese citizens.</p>\n<p>Because these issues sometimes threatened local social stability, and, more fundamentally, the reputation and legitimacy of the Party, it became dangerous work for rights lawyers. The Chinese Communist Party (CCP) readily imagined the prospect of an Eastern Europe-type \u201cColor Revolution\u201d or a \u201cJasmine Revolution\u201d in the wake of North Africa\u2019s Arab Spring uprisings. Whether they were headline legal disputes, or using courts as a stage to activate publics, or <em>causes c\u00e9l\u00e8bres</em> that could light up the internet, or an explosion of stories on social media\u2014any might be the spark that enflamed a forest fire which ultimately might bring down the CCP\u2019s control of China\u2019s state, conventionally labeled the Party-state.</p>\n<p>The periodic crackdowns on lawyers unfolded through warnings, detentions, \u201cdisappearances\u201d where lawyers simply could not be traced for months at a time, psychological and physical torture, and prison sentences. Between crackdowns lawyers would be pressured not to take cases or withdraw from them, threatened with loss of their practice licenses, placed under various levels of surveillance by the security apparatus, and even accosted physically by the \u201cblack mafia\u201d under government direction. Since 2008, the sufferings of these activist and defense lawyers reached worldwide audiences through the international media, international human rights groups, and foreign governments, including the European Union and United States (Liu and Halliday, 2017: 157-67).</p>\n<p>Sociologically, it can be seen why the Party-state, and its five systems of coercive control,<a class=\"anchor\" id=\"content100note1anc\" name=\"content100note1anc\">\u00a0</a><a class=\"note\" href=\"#content100note1sym\">[\u00a01\u00a0]</a> fear this relative handful of lawyers, even though they represent a tiny fraction of the hundreds of thousands in a legal profession that has exploded since 2000. The notable activists, as we labeled them (Liu and Halliday 2015: chapter 1), projected ideals that fundamentally challenged the monopoly over power by the Party.</p>\n<p>Surprisingly, our research discovered that a significant proportion of these several hundred rights lawyers, perhaps forty percent at one point, have been Protestant Christians. That in itself presented a further danger to the Party since these lawyers were also committed to another ideology counter to the official Party line. Inside China they were closely connected to China\u2019s largest civil society formation\u2014unofficial Protestant churches, and sometimes official Three-Self and sometimes Roman Catholic churches. These connections posed a threat to the Party and its security apparatus\u2014estimated by some to be a larger line of government expenditure than its entire military budget. Moreover, the connections that Christian lawyers had forged with Christian churches and organizations worldwide gave them spokespersons, defenders and enablers outside of China and beyond control of the Party.</p>\n<h2>Courage as a Virtue</h2>\n<p>Our sociological account of courage proposed that lawyers\u2019 fortitude was generated and sustained by three factors: lawyers\u2019 life experiences; their secular and religious beliefs; and sustained support from inside and outside China (Liu and Halliday 2015:chapter 5). How might a theological ethics of the virtues amplify or inform a social science analysis?</p>\n<h3>Courage as a Radical Christian Virtue\u00a0</h3>\n<p>Herdt (2013) helpfully contrasts Aristotle\u2019s concept of courage with that of Thomas Aquinas. In so doing she brings a Christian orientation much closer to the empirical reality of China\u2019s rights lawyers. For Aristotle, courage was exemplified on the battlefield, \u201climited to those who face death in battle.\u201d It thereby was restricted to the very few and animated by \u201csome good that transcends their lives and is thus honored by the community\u201d (Herdt 2013:110-12). For Aquinas, the meek submission of Christ to death on the cross presents a radical contrast in courage. This bold virtue now can be exemplified by all: \u201ceven those living a humdrum ordinary existence can have opportunities for genuine courage,\u201d even to its ultimate expression in martyrdom (Herdt 2013:122). The seemingly ordinary person exemplifies courage when s/he faces persecution and suffering for their faith and its expression in his or her persistent efforts to bring about a common good that \u201cstands firm in truth and justice\u201d (Herdt 2013:125).</p>\n<p>Many of China\u2019s Christian lawyers affirm that their activism is underwritten by ideals of charity (Halliday 2021). Their conviction about God\u2019s enduring love for them drives them to express that love for those far beyond their intimate circles of family or locality, indeed, out to other religions or even members of the CCP itself. In the contest with evil, in confrontations with persecutors, the Christian stays the course, fights the good fight, armed with this gift of the Holy Spirit, a \u201cconfidence that all dangers will be finally overcome, not just that they may be endured\u201d (Herdt 2013:126). The most resilient of the Christian rights lawyers would resonate with the affirmation of the Catechism of the Catholic Church that courage in the guise of fortitude reveals itself as \u201cthe moral virtue that ensures firmness in difficulties and constancy in the pursuit of good (Pinsent 2017).\u201d Or, in their moments of greatest stress, they would express the hope that not only could they exercise courage of \u201cthe kind that faces danger,\u201d but they might maintain the fortitude that \u201csticks at it under pain\u201d when so many have experienced excruciating physical and psychological torture (Lewis 1952:62).</p>\n<p>Yet, courage has its limits. When confronted with the loss of livelihood, poverty, public disgrace, torture, disappearance, long prison sentences, for some rights\u2019 lawyers fortitude weakened and courage crumbled. It is not a virtue that can be taken for granted, nor indeed confidently predicted when the pain becomes unbearable. Some have counted the struggle too painful and have walked away from it.</p>\n<h3>Manifestations of Courage in Rights Struggles</h3>\n<p>These characterizations of courage and fortitude resonate immediately in the context of China\u2019s rights struggles. There is a manifest struggle within China where the great majority of the lawyer vanguard are not great personages, eminent academics, or conventional notables in great law firms, but ordinary lawyers, frequently of humble backgrounds, who become extraordinary by their refusal to ignore the terrible harms being done by the Party to hundreds of millions of China\u2019s people (Halliday, Zilberstein, Espeland 2021), and by their persistent commitment to fight with whatever weapons of the weak that come to hand.</p>\n<p>Their fight has taken place on many fronts. They have taken on some of the most widely publicized cases: where a mother was arrested for her protests over failure to hold a high school principal accountable for raping her daughter; when hundreds of villagers protested, many subsequently arrested, because their seaside land was arbitrarily taken from them; when babies suffered and died because a baby formula manufacturer adulterated the \u201cmilk\u201d; when religious believers had their places of worship destroyed or their leaders arrested; among many others.</p>\n<p>Often cases morphed into public information campaigns as bloggers, lawyers, and netizens stirred up protests at manifest injustices, cruelties, and government indifference. On occasion they took the form of public theater, when defense lawyers attracted media attention by dramatic acts or banners on the steps of courtrooms. In a country where civil society and public discourse was in its infancy, these lawyers essentially became spokespersons for publics. After the country-wide 709 Crackdown, beginning on 9 July 2015, profiles of courage shifted within China and in the international media as outspoken wives of the disappeared and imprisoned lawyers, notably Christians Wang Qiaoling and Li Wenzu, led protests on behalf of their husbands.</p>\n<h3>How Faith Fortifies Courage in the Face of Suffering</h3>\n<p>Understandings of courage in the long Christian tradition help explain more convincingly why the Christian lawyers maintain the struggle. Even if they do not themselves know well the tradition, they recognize that courage can be expressed by the outsider, by those with less prestigious educational qualifications, by those who grew up in poorer provinces, and by those who rise out of family poverty. Those few who gave up comfortable practices in commercial and civil law for criminal and rights defense heed the pull of a deeper calling to defend the weak and bring about a just society. For the Christian lawyers, this courage is animated by the theological virtues of faith, hope and charity, as they openly expressed in my fieldwork (Halliday 2021).</p>\n<p>Moreover, for the Christians in particular a virtues\u2019 approach helps explain the puzzle of why a hard core of these lawyers keep on fighting on year after year, crackdown after crackdown, suffering piled upon suffering. Many have been urged by their spouses or parents and friends to desist, to give up and shift to safer arenas of legal practice. In these particularly difficult times, as Xi Jinping has deepened his assault on rule of law and lawyers, some still refuse to surrender. In the face of everyday persecution and relentless and intrusive surveillance, they persist. Other notable lawyers and legal academics come anew to the Christan faith.</p>\n<p>I conclude that in addition to legal or political or personal ideals that motivate China\u2019s rights lawyers to continue the struggle, the Christian lawyers have another source of resolve, a spiritual source, not only as a mystery of faith, but as it is expressed in community, both within China and across the church universal. 709 activist Wang Qiaoling explains that both the courage of the 709 wives and the Christian 709 lawyers are continuously permeated by their sense of God\u2019s presence, a confidence in God\u2019s leading, a diffuse sense that God is working through them for the hope of a transformed China.</p>\n<p>This courage is embedded and fortified in community. The Christian lawyers in Beijing met frequently over meals to discuss cases and to maintain solidarity. They earlier were knit together in a nation-wide online network. They joined together in teams for particular cases. After 709 many of the families were knit together into a supportive community thanks to the indefatigable efforts of resolute wives.</p>\n<p>At its extreme, Christian courage confronts violent death. A striking image of martyrdom, even in contemporary China, has imprinted itself on my mind. Reflecting Nero\u2019s horrific parade of martyred crucified Christians lining the road to Rome, a drawing some years ago pictured Christians on crosses lining a metaphorical winding road to Tiananmen Square and the entrance to the Heavenly City where China\u2019s leaders since Mao have appeared before the masses. A Christian rights lawyer, nailed to a cross, is readily identifiable. Here again the present-day suffering of China\u2019s Christian rights lawyers is grafted symbolically into the millenia-long tradition of Christians obedient unto death.</p>\n<h2>Practical Wisdom as a Virtue</h2>\n<p>The cardinal virtue of prudence, or practical wisdom, seems dim in its contrast to the blaze of courage. It is equally opaque to many Christians and manifestly absent in explicit terms from my fieldwork with China\u2019s Christian rights lawyers. Yet they speak constantly of a kind of practical wisdom that is integral to their practice as lawyers, their livelihoods, and their wellbeing\u2014even their freedom and, <em>in extremis</em>, their lives.</p>\n<p>Following Aquinas, and a long Christian tradition, the master ideals for the Christian, and the Christian human rights defenders, will be to adhere to principles of justice which give others their due (Wolterstorff, <a href=\"https://globalfacultyinitiative.net/content_item/99\">Theology Brief on Justice and Rights</a>), to bring about a good society which fosters human flourishing, and to act toward others out of Christian charity and love, all ultimately oriented to a heavenly life which is prefigured now and realized after death (Pinsent 2017:18).</p>\n<p>These abstract ideals, however, do not readily convert into a wise decision about how to act in a given situation. For these, there must be <em>deliberation, </em>as a person comprehends the particularities of the current situation, <em>judgment, </em>as a person decides how and when to act, and <em>action </em>itself, as a person carries it out more or less perfectly or competently in practice (Wood 2014:45-7). \u201cPrudence at work,\u201d then, for the Christian human rights defender, manifests a transcendence that is more than tactics or cunning (Wood 2014: 41-44).</p>\n<p>For the Christian, as I understand it, the necessity for practical wisdom lies in the fit between high level moral norms about how we should behave\u2014the master ethical standards of our faith\u2014and the vast number of everyday circumstances where those norms must be applied (Wood 2014). Since a system of rules for action could not possibly be comprehensive and detailed enough to meet every contingency in every moment in every situation, the \u201cthe virtue of knowing the next step to take,\u201d and \u201cwhat we should do in each situation,\u201d becomes of the utmost importance (Herdt 2017:17). This is particularly challenging when the powers of evil, the Chinese Communist Party, the Party-state, and its security apparatuses, deliberately create uncertainties about what actions at what moments will be in their red zone, and thus almost certainly ensure a quick punitive responses, and what are in their grey zones, and thus may be tolerated for the moment.</p>\n<p>How can we understand practical wisdom theologically in ways that enrich empirical data on skills, intuitions, tactics commonly discussed by lawyers who live in twilight zones of danger and risk?</p>\n<h3>Practical Wisdom in Chinese Legal Rights Practice</h3>\n<p>Over many years of fieldwork and hundreds of interviews, rights defense lawyers reveal a plethora of questions and decisions they make about ways to maintain courage without the losses to practice, livelihood, comfortable living, or even life, which exist as tangible threats always on their minds.</p>\n<p>When a lawyer is told by the Justice Bureau to walk away from a case, should s/he? When judges refuse to hear a witness or enter evidence, should the lawyer rouse the public to pressure the judges? When pressured by a prosecutor or judges to \u201charmonize\u201d or settle a contentious case prematurely, should they? How far should they adopt the tactics of extreme proceduralism\u2014so-called die-hard tactics\u2014to tie up a court whose judges are acting in a hostile manner? When should a lawyer accept a case without payment or costs? When should a lawyer accept moneys from overseas, whether for a case, or personal support, or for an NGO? When should lawyers gather together in fraught times? Should a lawyer refuse to answer her/his phone when repeatedly contacted by public or state security? During harsh interrogation, should a captive lawyer implicate friends and colleagues?</p>\n<p>At the outset, it can appear that courage and prudence stand in some degree of tension. At one pole an excess of courage can lead to impetuousness, excessive risk-taking, recklessness, unconstrained impulses of anger or frustration, visceral outbursts, negligence or rashness (Wood 2014:37-8, 47-8). For instance, Gao Zhisheng, among the most incorrigible and relentlessly persecuted Christian lawyers, has been criticized by an eminent international authority on China\u2019s laws because Gao kept on speaking out about the manifest injustices of his incarceration even though his outspokenness ensured harsher treatment, and possibly death (Gao 2017). What good does it do, asked the international authority, if Gao disappears into a Chinese grave and his voice is silenced?</p>\n<p>Prudence has dangers of too little or too much. Too little, and persons act rashly, with harsh even fatal consequences; too much, and persons act timidly, letting down not only their clients and cause, but the reputation of Christians and the faith itself. For instance, a rights\u2019 lawyer is asked to take on a case where the detained or arrested person is a member of Falun Gong, a brutally repressed quasi-religious movement whose members have been killed and imprisoned in the thousands, since Falun Gong boldly surrounded Zhonghanhai, the walled residential and office heartland of China\u2019s rulers, adjacent to the Heavenly City and Tiananmen Square. The risks are high. Falun Gong has been classified as an \u201cevil cult.\u201d To take on Falun Gong cases risks harassment for the lawyer from the local Justice Bureau, pressure on law firms to withdraw from a case, black marks that can affect renewal of an annual lawyer\u2019s license, and thereby the lawyer\u2019s livelihood. Yet the boldest of rights\u2019 lawyers once hailed peers who dared to take such cases as the pinnacle of rights defense in China. Christian lawyers can see this stand for a religious group as a public display of Christian charity in the face of savage injustice.</p>\n<p>Or consider the decision of Li Heping, a leader of Christian rights lawyers in the 2000s, to \u201cstep back from the front line\u201d of representing clients in \u201csensitive cases\u201d and to focus on NGO activities against torture in China. After being badly tortured himself during detention in the 2008 crackdown, Li Heping judged that anti-torture activities would be less sensitive for the security apparatus. Alas, when arrested and \u201cdisappeared\u201d for many months in the nationwide 709 Crackdown in 2015, Li Heping learned under interrogation that the security apparatus considered his anti-torture campaign, with its international connections, to be a threat to the Party.</p>\n<p>Repeatedly in my fieldwork, I witnessed or was told of lawyers\u2019 perpetual challenge to stay the course in acts of courage, yet without going either to the extreme of full retreat from their rights representation or to the extreme of actions so provocative that they almost certainly would lead to severe repercussions. Their lives were repeatedly punctuated with judgments about which actions, in the present moment and in view of a lawyer\u2019s earlier encounters with public and state security, could or should not be undertaken.</p>\n<p>Integrating practical wisdom into our understanding of the rights struggle may therefore yield a double benefit.</p>\n<p>First, from a conventional social science vantage-point, we can see that the rights struggle for the Christian lawyers is more than a professional obligation and calling, more than an outworking of their inward sense that the weak must be defended and the strong be held accountable. It goes beyond intuitive or juridical ideals of justice, or the codification of justice in constitutionalism or rule of law ideals and institutions. The lens of practical wisdom brings what might be seen as a transient particular case into a cosmic moral order, into the sphere of entangling with principalities and powers.</p>\n<p>Second, for the Christian lawyers themselves, a deeper awareness of Christian thought, as it has been elaborated through countless instances of persecution and suffering in the history of the church, might add to their armory of faith. It solidifies fortitude. It lifts a worldly struggle into something transcendent. It takes a trial of this moment and situates it in a trajectory that reaches through the long history of the faith to beyond time.</p>\n<p>Despite the evidence that rights lawyers are constantly making judgments about how to act in a given risky moment, I recognize that I am as yet seeing through a glass darkly when I seek to grasp what is the distinctive understanding that is yielded by the Christian ethical attribute of prudence. Is it that the Christian is consciously or diffusely always weighing the action in this current situation in relation to the high ideals of faith and the call to courage? Is the Christian gaining an increment of courage, or a refinement of judgment, because they seek to be faithful to the ideals of justice? Is it that the Christian\u2019s decisions to act are driven by the motivations of love or mercy or compassion rather than social ideals, fear or fame? Compared to non-Christian lawyers and rights activists who face risk with experience, discernment and refined judgment, does the Christian activist act prudently in discernibly distinctive ways? Professor Herdt opens up a new angle of orientation to rights struggles in China and far beyond.</p>\n<h2>Communities of Vice and Virtue</h2>\n<p>A partial answer to the question of Christian virtues in a contemporary rights struggle may be found in rights\u2019 lawyers embeddedness in community. And this brings me to a puzzle in the Christian scholarship on virtues in theological ethics.</p>\n<p>Conventionally, it seems, virtues are attributed by theological ethicists to individuals. Individuals with more or less virtue may influence institutions. And institutions can cultivate or erode virtuous behavior by their members. However, I see considerable merit in Oliver O\u2019Donovan\u2019s (see Disciplinary Brief on <a href=\"https://globalfacultyinitiative.net/content_item/462\">The Place of Virtue Theory in Christian Ethics</a>) readiness to attribute virtues to collectivities\u2014families, corporations, voluntary associations, states, international organizations.</p>\n<p>Here I propose that the community of rights\u2019 lawyers in China, and in particular that community of Christian lawyers within the wider community, can be seen as a carrier of courage or prudence. China\u2019s Christian rights lawyers have been more than a bundle of individuals, or a network of contacts. They have understood themselves to be in fellowship. They share religious beliefs. They work in teams. They \u201cbreak bread\u201d together.</p>\n<p>In these respects, as social scientists put it, the community of human rights lawyers in China is an emergent social group. True, the virtues of individuals influence the community as a whole. True, the community influences the lawyers within it. But more than that, communities themselves have properties of virtue or vice. Virtues are a constitutive part of the Christian rights community. In community they join together to talk through all the dangers and contingencies of practice, in effect, balancing the impetus to courage with the wisdom of prudence. Indeed, we may properly depict the determination of the Christian rights\u2019 lawyers to stay connected, despite the efforts to isolate them, as a collective act, an act of corporate courage. And we can well comprehend their judgments about more or less risky behavior as a collective attribute of prudence. Going out of Beijing or lying low during high profile political events in Beijing is one example. Joining high profile trials as a team, and showing solidarity in numbers, is another. Avoiding direct verbal attacks in public or the social media on the CCP or on Chairman Xi Jinping is yet another. Of course, there is variation within the group and there are those step outside the community to act in another way. A core of practical wisdom, however, centers the community and places bounds around an excess of courage.</p>\n<p>Against that community of virtue stands a community of vice\u2014the institution of the Chinese Communist Party\u2014which repudiates the Christian virtues of love, justice, temperance, among others. The Christian community depicts the CCP as much more than a conglomeration of Party members. It embodies and propagates vices explicitly at odds with those of the Christian virtues, not least with its addiction to power. Any kind of cruelty is acceptable if it will sustain the Party\u2019s control of China\u2019s state and society, its cultivation of avarice and nationalism.</p>\n<p>We may then speak of a virtuous community. It has a shared ethos of what constitutes courage and the circumstances in which practical wisdom tempers and modifies expressions of courage. This community stands in sharp counterpoint to the institutions of vice which confront it in an enduring struggle over ideals and practices. The density of lawyer networks, their proclivities for working in teams, their connections online and through shared meals melded together in a community which held beliefs in common and which exemplified courage and prudence in the pursuit of justice in deeply unjust society.</p>\n<h2 class=\"new_page\">References</h2>\n<p>Fu, Hualing, and Richard Cullen. 2011. \"Climbing the <em>Weiquan </em>Ladder: A Radicalizing Process for Rights-Protection Lawyers.\" <em>The China Quarterly</em> 205:40-59.</p>\n<p>Gao, Zhisheng. 2017. <em>Unwavering Convictions: Gao Zhisheng's Ten-Year Torture and Faith in China's Future</em>.

As to the former \u2013 looking back on the evolution of sexual violence law, we can see how the substantive and procedural rules relating to the sanctioning and condemning of rape and associated sexual crimes have over time become more expansive. Law\u2019s understanding of the harms and wrongs of rape has evolved to reflect what we might understand as improvements in social/communal commitment to certain virtues, such as justice in the sense of embodying fairness in our relationships with others; and love, respect, and genuine regard for the inherent dignity and worth of others. I recently described this as a gradual \u2018democratization\u2019 of sexual dignity (High, 2022). The harm of rape was historically framed as an affront to (white, landholding) male dignity, a violation of another man\u2019s wife or unmarried daughter (property). In this conservative theory of rape, women were not seen as equal in dignity to men, but rather their bodies were objectified as sites of harm done to men. The consequences of this framing for women were bleak \u2013 for example, the \u2018marital immunity\u2019 rule (that a man could not be guilty of raping his own wife, even if she did not in fact consent); the impunity with which men could rape an \u2018unchaste\u2019 or \u2018unvirtuous\u2019 victim. Over time, with increasing social commitment to autonomy, equality, dignity, the status of women has improved, and a more liberal understanding of rape has emerged, one which understands rape as an affront to the victim\u2019s autonomy and dignity. Previous marginal cases \u2013 the rape of married women, black women, gay women, slutty women \u2013 are no longer marginal, as sexual dignity has been re-theorized as universal, inherent, and inviolable. And in tandem with these changing societal norms, our substantive and procedural rules have evolved, improving conditions for flourishing by sanctioning a wider range of non-consensual sex as criminal.\n\nJust as importantly, we can apply a \u2018virtues\u2019 framework to think about the potential for law reform to effect changes in societal norms. We might advocate for certain changes to law on the grounds that our law should be aspirational. Take affirmative consent, for example \u2013 the idea that the legal standard for consent, the dividing line between permissible and impermissible sex [\u00a01\u00a0] , should require some form of external (words or actions) expression of agreement. Various versions of sexual violence reforms have been implemented in various jurisdictions, most recently in Australia\u2019s states of Victoria and New South Wales Affirmative consent is frequently put forward as a means of ensuring greater mutuality, respect, and equality in sexual intimacy. Affirmative consent would require sexual instigators to look for an affirmative expression of consent (a clear \u2018yes\u2019 through words or actions from their partner) before proceeding, rather than, as historically been permissible, assuming a person is consenting until or unless that person clearly says \u2018no\u2019, whether through words or by physical resistance to the requisite degree.\n\nBut this gives rise to a tension. As critics of affirmative consent rightly point out, it is depressingly, empirically apparent that sex today is frequently not about mutuality, respect, and equality. Many people continue to assume consent, rather than looking for a clear \u2018yes\u2019 from their \u2018partner\u2019, on the basis that \u2018if she doesn\u2019t want this, it\u2019s on her to let me know\u2019. This is not, I would argue, virtuous behaviour; it does not exemplify a genuine sense of fairness, respect and regard for the autonomy and wellbeing of other people.\n\nNow, the tension. We may wish that our prevailing societal sexual norms were more virtuous; but is law reform an appropriate tool for moulding those norms? Will reforming our laws, to align with our aspirations of virtuous, morally good sexual behaviour, create \u2018sacrificial lambs\u2019 as we wait for socio-sexual norms to catch up with the law? By which I mean, if law is reformed to put the onus on instigators to ensure consent, to take better care with regard to the desires of others, and to proceed with sexual contact only where there is assurance it is based on mutuality, will people end up being punished for behaviour which is common and was previously permissible at law? And if the broader criminal system is a discriminatory one (a self-evident \u2018vice\u2019 in most legal systems), who are those sacrificial lambs likely to be? The use of law reform, such as affirmative consent reform, to shift behaviour and over time cultivate a virtuous society, in which more humans are likely to flourish, points to a cross-cutting tension in law: \u2018whether criminal law \u2026 is an appropriate tool of \u2026 cultural transformation\u2019 (Gruber, 445).\n\nDespite these questions and tensions, affirmative consent law reform projects are ongoing in numerous jurisdictions. Optimistically, we might posit that by changing our law to reflect the communicative, virtuous socio-sexual norms to which we aspire, there will be a trickle-down effect, and those virtues will increasingly permeate socially. We can think of law as possibly \u2018aspirational\u2019 in this way, a tool for setting out the aspirations of a social group, even where norms of behaviour will continue inevitably to fall short in many instances from those ideals. Cynically, we might say this is tokenism, empty symbolism; what evidence do we have that embedding affirmative consent as a legal standard will cultivate more communicative, respectful socio-sexual behaviour? I tend to err on the side of optimism; I think that symbolism through law reform might just, albeit slowly, gradually, have a tangible effect in terms of shifting society\u2019s \u2018moral posture\u2019 (Caringella, 203). But even adopting this optimistic position, such change will inevitably take time, and will require proactive educative measures. Perhaps in the meantime, affirmative consent really is about a political decision: what are the norms and values we choose to be symbolised in our legal construction of consent?\n\nCaringella, Susan.

    "bodyText": "Legal issues often involve the resolution of moral dilemmas. Law has its limitations, its areas of discretion or ambiguity. The extent to which just and fair decisions can be made depends not only on how good and comprehensive the law is, but also on how legal professionals interpret and practice the law, as well as on how they exercise discretionary powers within the legal system.\n\nTo uphold the rule of law, to advocate for its development, and to make good, principled and reasonable decisions, judges and legal practitioners often - perhaps always - must rely on virtues, notably courage and prudence. They must prioritize fairness and justice when exercising discretionary powers in the law in a range of contexts and circumstances.\n\nUnder a legal system governed by the rule of law, the judiciary conventionally prescribes rules about the conduct of judges in both their professional and personal spheres. Whether or not codified, these rules are frequently grounded on virtues. A virtuous judiciary and virtuous judges can uphold the legitimacy and authority of the law, enhance the public\u2019s esteem of the legal system, and forestall perceptions of professional vices that could undermine judicial authority and reduce public confidence in their decisions.\n\nI shall illustrate the significance of virtues in judicial decision-making from my specialty fields of public-interest law and socio-economic rights.\n\nUnder the common law system, which is found in most countries of the British Commonwealth, it is not unusual for judges on the bench to hold differing opinions on contentious legal or moral issues. This is where dissenting decisions come from. Sometimes it is possible for judges to make reasoned, lawful and completely justified decisions one way or the other according to the law. Many judges adhere to the theory of legal positivism by HLA Hart, [\u00a01\u00a0] in which law and morality are regarded as completely separate. In practice, judges may assert that their decisions are based solely on the law and not influenced by any extraneous factors like personal preferences, societal values or politics. But a closer examination of some judgments may reveal that ethical values, social considerations and political preferences underpinned their decisions and guided their reasoning process. This phenomenon is explained by the theory of legal realism, [\u00a02\u00a0] where judges are influenced by their social contexts and consider public policies in making decisions. A judge\u2019s background - for instance, middle or upper class, middle aged, with privileged education and a successful prior professional career \u2013 may affect their perspective on society and its structure. [\u00a03\u00a0]\n\nThe core values embedded in the common law legal system are justice, fairness, liberty, equality and the protection of fundamental rights. All written law should align with these core values. Nevertheless, there are instances where omission, poor drafting, lack of foresight or a failure of the law to respond to social changes sometimes lead to situations where the strict application of the law may conflict with these core values. In such circumstances, we can find numerous examples where judges exercise their judicial discretion and practical wisdom to develop the law incrementally and by analogy, to ensure that fairness and justice is achieved in the case at hand despite the inadequacy of the law. A famous example is the right-to-food campaign case in the Supreme Court of India ( People\u2019s Union for Civil Liberties v Union of India & Ors (Writ Petition (Civil) No. 196 of 2001). Here judges recognised that people suffering from famine and starvation had a right to food, which can be derived from the right to life under article 21 of the Constitution of India, even though the right to food is not expressly mentioned as an enforceable fundamental right in the Indian Constitution.\n\nHowever, judges have to navigate this realm carefully. On the one hand, they cannot deviate from the clear wordings of the law in deciding cases, as judicial discretion (if any) must be legitimately exercised within legal boundaries and with self-restraint. Otherwise it would reduce the consistency and certainty in the application of the law and thus undermine the rule of law. On the other hand, failure to address moral dilemmas by blindly applying the law can lead to unfair and unjust outcomes that contradict the core values of the common law system. Such decisions may trigger public outcry, or at least set bad precedents.\n\nThere are of course numerous instances where judges must decide cases strictly according to the law even when doing so may lead to unsatisfactory outcomes. These are cases where the law clearly binds judges in making such decisions, leaving no room for discretion regardless of the potential for injustice. In such contexts legislative change with proper prior consultation and debate is necessary. However, in cases where there is room for different interpretations or applications of the law, some judges may be oblivious to the law\u2019s unfairness to the weak, or to the power imbalance between the rulers and the ruled in the legal process \u2013 a realization that requires virtues and reflection. Other judges may be aware of the moral dilemma but choose to align with the powerful if their concept of fairness is tilted towards established power structures.\n\nIn authoritarian regimes where judicial independence, separation of powers and the rule of law are undermined, the moral dilemmas that judges face may be more acute. Law may itself be biased and unfair, offering limited legal protections to the vulnerable and the dissenting. Judges may even face political pressure when making decisions. When met with moral challenges, judicial conscience plays a crucial role. It takes courage and wisdom for judges to deliver impartial and fair rulings even if they may displease the government. For example, it may be challenging for judges to strike down decisions of the government to approve the industrial extraction and development of certain sites with great environmental conservation value according to environmental protection laws and standards. The governmental approval may have been given without lawful and valid prior environmental impact assessments, perhaps because of the strong connections between (or even monetary reward from) powerful commercial developers and the government. Judges who rule against the government may jeopardize their career advancement, face reprimands, or encounter political backlash. They will need great practical wisdom, courage, and honesty to navigate these challenging arenas, to take appropriate steps to achieve justice and fairness in face of obstacles and in ways that are reasonable and practical.\n\nCourage empowers lawyers and advocates to speak out and challenge established norms and practices that unfairly benefit the privileged or disadvantage minorities and vulnerable groups. Rights activists can bring about significant social changes and offer hope and opportunities to disadvantaged groups in ways that many did not think feasible. To name two examples:\n\nLawyers representing vulnerable groups claiming from the government the basic protection of housing and urgent relief from lack of shelter. In the South African Constitutional Court case of Grootboom v Government of the Republic of South Africa [2000] ZACC 19, lawyers represented the slum dwellers in a legal action against the government. Because of the appalling living conditions while waiting to be allocated low-cost housing, the slum-dwellers moved to nearby private land earmarked for low-cost housing. They were forcibly evicted by the government, which set fire to their dwelling places and left them homeless. The Constitutional Court of South Africa held that the government breached the duty to progressively realise the right to access to adequate housing under s.26 of the South African Constitution by failing to provide any form of immediate or short-term relief for people who were in the most desperate need of housing.\n\nAdvocates challenging the government in court to change law and policies that infringe the basic social welfare rights of citizens. In the Hong Kong case of Kong Yunming v Director of Social Welfare ([2013] HKCFA 107), the social welfare department removed the eligibility to receive basic safety-net social welfare assistance from residents who had been in Hong Kong for more than a year but less than seven years (before becoming permanent residents) The Court of Final Appeal decided that this policy was unconstitutional, as art.36 and art.145 of the Basic Law of Hong Kong guaranteed the right to social welfare for all residents at a level not lower than the time of Hong Kong\u2019s return to Chinese sovereignty.\n\nTo achieve the greater good sustainably, there is a delicate balance that requires virtues in advocacy endeavours on the path to justice. Many advocacy efforts are driven by anger, but this anger is to be balanced with love and self-control. According to the Bible, love does not delight in evil but rejoices with the truth, love is not self-seeking, it does not boast, it is not proud and not rude. There is a difference between raw, unconstrained anger (a vice) versus ethically driven anger (a virtue supported by action in service of love). In the former, rights activists may be perceived as self-righteous, impatient, lacking in prudence, seeking to receive self-recognition through doing good, while compromising the interests of the minorities they represent. The Bible reminds us that \u201ceveryone should be quick to listen, slow to speak and slow to become angry, because human anger does not produce the righteousness that God desires\u201d (James 1:19-20).\n\nChristian rights advocates guided by virtues and ethically driven anger often remind themselves that God is the ultimate judge of true justice. They are to fulfill God\u2019s requirement to do justice, love mercy and walk humbly with the Lord (Micah 6:8). They are contemplative in their advocacy journey through continuous reflection on their inner motives, advocacy strategies, and their relationship with stakeholders. In this way, they work towards the greater good while avoid falling into vices or actions that undermine rights activism.\n\nIn academia, virtues are integral to the shaping of one\u2019s scholarly life. Practical wisdom may guide a legal academic to allocate their time and resources well for the service of the institution, their students, the legal profession and the community, ultimately fostering human flourishing. The extent to which such virtuous decisions can be consistently made depends on the virtue ethics of the legal academic. As Professor Herdt has highlighted, Christian virtues are both infused and cultivated (p.8).\n\nOut of love and a conviction to pursue a particular cause or promote the welfare of a vulnerable group, virtues can empower a legal scholar to choose to research in particular areas or issues that contribute to human flourishing, even if these may not easily lend themselves to publication in prestigious journals or greatly boost the research or career profile of the academic. At the same time, political, social and institutional pressure can force a person, driven by fear, to choose to prioritize self-preservation rather than to enhance the human flourishing of others out of love. Academics may feel pressured to meet publication quotas and thus strategically focus on topics that can secure more research funding and lead more easily to quick publication in top journals, giving up their calling to pursue other meaningful and interesting topics for the greater social good, which may take more time and effort to research and may not be a timely topic for top journals. At worst, as Professor Herdt points out, some academics may \u201cneglect their teaching or other responsibilities\u201d (p.12) towards students and prefer to spend most time on research and publication, which is the primary indicator for promotion and tenure. A concerning reality is that those academics usually achieve greater success in the academy and, quite often, far beyond it.\n\nPublic intellectuals are frequently employed by academic institutions, yet their role extends beyond that of a teacher of mere employee. They have an important responsibility in the society to share their knowledge and insights to address societal needs and to promote the public good. For example, a land law scholar may be interviewed in the media about the implications of a proposed legislative change that affects the land rights of an indigenous population; or a social law academic may share her research findings with government officials and NGOs about how the law and policy on aged care and nursing homes can be modified to cater for the needs of older persons in the society and up to international standards.\n\nAs Prof Herdt suggests, they are to contribute to genuine human flourishing (p.12). However, this mission may sometimes put public intellectuals in conflict with institutional interests, for example, where the institutions or powerful authorities hold political or social biases that may clash with the research findings of the public intellectuals. This is especially true for illiberal societies where the rulers or a one-party state can feel threatened by public opinion research on sensitive political issues, or by the unpopularity of political figures, or by research findings that disclose the abuse of power or lack of accountability of public institutions. In such situations, public intellectuals must balance their social role and mission, while exercising practical wisdom. Virtues such as courage and prudence can serve as a moral compass to guide them to navigate these challenges.\n\nAt some critical moments, Christian academics may face the choice of whether to continue to remain employed by the university they are working at, if they find it difficult to practise virtues that are counter to institutional or political pressures in their workplace. They may be staying at a high cost as it may risk their own fallenness of morality in the long run if they are compromising more and more in their actions, resulting in the stifling of their ability to continue to do good and meaningful work for the academic field, the students and the community. Or a Christian academic may choose to sever their ties with those institutions and authorities and find a more nurturing place that enables them to better promote human flourishing.\n\nThe decision to stay or to move on to a more nurturing environment can take into account a number of considerations. These include the level of support and pressure the Christian receives in the institutions, and whether there are people upholding similar values who could work together with the Christian. Are there \u201ccommunities of faith\u201d (as Professor Herdt mentioned at p.4) or is the Christian mostly fighting the battle alone? To what extent could the investment of time and effort make meaningful and positive changes to the situation and enable human flourishing? Could the Christian maintain his or her values despite the pressure? To what degree is the Christian\u2019s well-being affected? What opportunities are available to move to a more nurturing environment?\n\nA virtuous legal system is sustained by virtuous legal professionals, including judges, lawyers, rights activists and legal academics. The legal conscience, which embeds morality and virtues, m guide the thoughts and actions of legal professionals as they navigate challenging and contentious issues. The ultimate goal in a rule of law legal system is the attainment of justice, fairness, and equality.\n\n[\u00a01\u00a0] Hart, HLA (1961). The concept of law.

    "bodyHtml": "<p>Legal issues often involve the resolution of moral dilemmas. Law has its limitations, its areas of discretion or ambiguity. The extent to which just and fair decisions can be made depends not only on how good and comprehensive the law is, but also on how legal professionals interpret and practice the law, as well as on how they exercise discretionary powers within the legal system.</p>\n<p>To uphold the rule of law, to advocate for its development, and to make good, principled and reasonable decisions, judges and legal practitioners often - perhaps always - must rely on virtues, notably courage and prudence. They must prioritize fairness and justice when exercising discretionary powers in the law in a range of contexts and circumstances.</p>\n<p>Under a legal system governed by the rule of law, the judiciary conventionally prescribes rules about the conduct of judges in both their professional and personal spheres. Whether or not codified, these rules are frequently grounded on virtues. A virtuous judiciary and virtuous judges can uphold the legitimacy and authority of the law, enhance the public\u2019s esteem of the legal system, and forestall perceptions of professional vices that could undermine judicial authority and reduce public confidence in their decisions.</p>\n<h2>Virtues and Judicial Decision-making</h2>\n<p>I shall illustrate the significance of virtues in judicial decision-making from my specialty fields of public-interest law and socio-economic rights.</p>\n<h3>Common Law Legal Systems</h3>\n<p>Under the common law system, which is found in most countries of the British Commonwealth, it is not unusual for judges on the bench to hold differing opinions on contentious legal or moral issues. This is where dissenting decisions come from. Sometimes it is possible for judges to make reasoned, lawful and completely justified decisions one way or the other according to the law. Many judges adhere to the theory of legal positivism by HLA Hart,<a class=\"anchor\" id=\"content100note1anc\" name=\"content100note1anc\">\u00a0</a><a class=\"note\" href=\"#content100note1sym\">[\u00a01\u00a0]</a> in which law and morality are regarded as completely separate. In practice, judges may assert that their decisions are based solely on the law and not influenced by any extraneous factors like personal preferences, societal values or politics. But a closer examination of some judgments may reveal that ethical values, social considerations and political preferences underpinned their decisions and guided their reasoning process. This phenomenon is explained by the theory of legal realism,<a class=\"anchor\" id=\"content100note2anc\" name=\"content100note2anc\">\u00a0</a><a class=\"note\" href=\"#content100note2sym\">[\u00a02\u00a0]</a> where judges are influenced by their social contexts and consider public policies in making decisions. A judge\u2019s background - for instance, middle or upper class, middle aged, with privileged education and a successful prior professional career \u2013 may affect their perspective on society and its structure.<a class=\"anchor\" id=\"content100note3anc\" name=\"content100note3anc\">\u00a0</a><a class=\"note\" href=\"#content100note3sym\">[\u00a03\u00a0]</a></p>\n<p>The core values embedded in the common law legal system are justice, fairness, liberty, equality and the protection of fundamental rights. All written law should align with these core values. Nevertheless, there are instances where omission, poor drafting, lack of foresight or a failure of the law to respond to social changes sometimes lead to situations where the strict application of the law may conflict with these core values. In such circumstances, we can find numerous examples where judges exercise their judicial discretion and practical wisdom to develop the law incrementally and by analogy, to ensure that fairness and justice is achieved in the case at hand despite the inadequacy of the law. A famous example is the right-to-food campaign case in the Supreme Court of India (<em>People\u2019s Union for Civil Liberties v Union of India &amp; Ors</em> (Writ Petition (Civil) No. 196 of 2001). Here judges recognised that people suffering from famine and starvation had a right to food, which can be derived from the right to life under article 21 of the Constitution of India, even though the right to food is not expressly mentioned as an enforceable fundamental right in the Indian Constitution.</p>\n<p>However, judges have to navigate this realm carefully. On the one hand, they cannot deviate from the clear wordings of the law in deciding cases, as judicial discretion (if any) must be legitimately exercised within legal boundaries and with self-restraint. Otherwise it would reduce the consistency and certainty in the application of the law and thus undermine the rule of law. On the other hand, failure to address moral dilemmas by blindly applying the law can lead to unfair and unjust outcomes that contradict the core values of the common law system. Such decisions may trigger public outcry, or at least set bad precedents.</p>\n<p>There are of course numerous instances where judges must decide cases strictly according to the law even when doing so may lead to unsatisfactory outcomes. These are cases where the law clearly binds judges in making such decisions, leaving no room for discretion regardless of the potential for injustice. In such contexts legislative change with proper prior consultation and debate is necessary. However, in cases where there is room for different interpretations or applications of the law, some judges may be oblivious to the law\u2019s unfairness to the weak, or to the power imbalance between the rulers and the ruled in the legal process \u2013 a realization that requires virtues and reflection. Other judges may be aware of the moral dilemma but choose to align with the powerful if their concept of fairness is tilted towards established power structures.</p>\n<h3>Authoritarian Regimes</h3>\n<p>In authoritarian regimes where judicial independence, separation of powers and the rule of law are undermined, the moral dilemmas that judges face may be more acute. Law may itself be biased and unfair, offering limited legal protections to the vulnerable and the dissenting. Judges may even face political pressure when making decisions. When met with moral challenges, judicial conscience plays a crucial role. It takes courage and wisdom for judges to deliver impartial and fair rulings even if they may displease the government. For example, it may be challenging for judges to strike down decisions of the government to approve the industrial extraction and development of certain sites with great environmental conservation value according to environmental protection laws and standards. The governmental approval may have been given without lawful and valid prior environmental impact assessments, perhaps because of the strong connections between (or even monetary reward from) powerful commercial developers and the government. Judges who rule against the government may jeopardize their career advancement, face reprimands, or encounter political backlash. They will need great practical wisdom, courage, and honesty to navigate these challenging arenas, to take appropriate steps to achieve justice and fairness in face of obstacles and in ways that are reasonable and practical.</p>\n<h2>Virtues and Rights Activism</h2>\n<p>Courage empowers lawyers and advocates to speak out and challenge established norms and practices that unfairly benefit the privileged or disadvantage minorities and vulnerable groups. Rights activists can bring about significant social changes and offer hope and opportunities to disadvantaged groups in ways that many did not think feasible. To name two examples:</p>\n<h3>The Right to Housing</h3>\n<p>Lawyers representing vulnerable groups claiming from the government the basic protection of housing and urgent relief from lack of shelter. In the South African Constitutional Court case of <em>Grootboom v Government of the Republic of South Africa</em> [2000] ZACC 19, lawyers represented the slum dwellers in a legal action against the government. Because of the appalling living conditions while waiting to be allocated low-cost housing, the slum-dwellers moved to nearby private land earmarked for low-cost housing. They were forcibly evicted by the government, which set fire to their dwelling places and left them homeless. The Constitutional Court of South Africa held that the government breached the duty to progressively realise the right to access to adequate housing under s.26 of the South African Constitution by failing to provide any form of immediate or short-term relief for people who were in the most desperate need of housing.</p>\n<h3>Social Welfare Rights</h3>\n<p>Advocates challenging the government in court to change law and policies that infringe the basic social welfare rights of citizens. In the Hong Kong case of <em>Kong Yunming v Director of Social Welfare</em> ([2013] HKCFA 107), the social welfare department removed the eligibility to receive basic safety-net social welfare assistance from residents who had been in Hong Kong for more than a year but less than seven years (before becoming permanent residents) The Court of Final Appeal decided that this policy was unconstitutional, as art.36 and art.145 of the Basic Law of Hong Kong guaranteed the right to social welfare for all residents at a level not lower than the time of Hong Kong\u2019s return to Chinese sovereignty.</p>\n<p>To achieve the greater good sustainably, there is a delicate balance that requires virtues in advocacy endeavours on the path to justice. Many advocacy efforts are driven by anger, but this anger is to be balanced with love and self-control. According to the Bible, love does not delight in evil but rejoices with the truth, love is not self-seeking, it does not boast, it is not proud and not rude. There is a difference between raw, unconstrained anger (a vice) versus ethically driven anger (a virtue supported by action in service of love).

The Bible reminds us that \u201ceveryone should be quick to listen, slow to speak and slow to become angry, because human anger does not produce the righteousness that God desires\u201d (James 1:19-20).</p>\n<p>Christian rights advocates guided by virtues and ethically driven anger often remind themselves that God is the ultimate judge of true justice. They are to fulfill God\u2019s requirement to do justice, love mercy and walk humbly with the Lord (Micah 6:8). They are contemplative in their advocacy journey through continuous reflection on their inner motives, advocacy strategies, and their relationship with stakeholders. In this way, they work towards the greater good while avoid falling into vices or actions that undermine rights activism.</p>\n<h2>Virtues in Legal Academia</h2>\n<p>In academia, virtues are integral to the shaping of one\u2019s scholarly life. Practical wisdom may guide a legal academic to allocate their time and resources well for the service of the institution, their students, the legal profession and the community, ultimately fostering human flourishing. The extent to which such virtuous decisions can be consistently made depends on the virtue ethics of the legal academic. As Professor Herdt has highlighted, Christian virtues are both infused and cultivated (p.8).</p>\n<h3>Fear and Love in the Virtuous Academic Life</h3>\n<p>Out of love and a conviction to pursue a particular cause or promote the welfare of a vulnerable group, virtues can empower a legal scholar to choose to research in particular areas or issues that contribute to human flourishing, even if these may not easily lend themselves to publication in prestigious journals or greatly boost the research or career profile of the academic.

    "bodyText": "Dr. Herdt\u2019s beautiful discussion of the virtues clarifies and resonates with my own recent thinking as a Christian academic psychiatrist. Virtues have been historically neglected within psychiatric practice. Reasons include concerns about scientific objectivity, realistic expectations, and therapeutic moralism.\n\nRenewed interest in their clinical relevance has been stimulated by problems in sustaining professionalism, growing attention to virtue ethics, empirical support for the benefits of virtues such as gratitude, and the emergence of a fourth wave of growth promoting therapies (1). I recently edited The Virtues in Psychiatric Practice (Oxford University Press, 2022) (2), which considers the implications of virtues of self-control (accountability, humility, equanimity), benevolence (forgiveness, compassion, love), intelligence (defiance, phronesis), and positivity (gratitude, self-transcendence, hope) for clinical work. However, more work needs to be done to understand how to incorporate a virtues based perspective into diagnostic assessment, goal-setting, and treatment.\n\nIn conducting a diagnostic assessment, mental health professionals aim to identify what enduring disposition and/or schema the patient has, and how this constitutes a strength and/or a vulnerability. Clinicians typically eschew the term \u201cvice\u201d as moralistic, but maladaptive personality traits or disorders reflect perhaps the most obvious example of a need for virtues\u2014for example, compassion in antisocial personalities, or humility in narcissistic individuals. Since a depressive disposition is often marked by guilt, inhibition and impaired self love, it often reflects a need for virtues of forgiveness, courage and love (3). Similarly, anxiety and PTSD are often accompanied by fear and distractibility, reflecting a need for equanimity, courage/defiance, and practical wisdom (phronesis) - virtues fostered by approaches such as Dialectical Behavior Therapy (DBT) and Acceptance and Commitment Therapy (ACT). Substance use disorders are often complicated by impulsivity, irresponsibility and guilt over damage done to self and others, reflecting needs for accountability, gratitude, and self-forgiveness (as encouraged by the Twelve Steps). Repair of moral injury often entails self awareness, moral integration, and re-connection to community.\n\nIn goal setting, a comprehensive formulation and treatment plan not only characterizes pathology, but envisions a desired, healthier version of the person and how the therapist can help them achieve it. Whether explicitly or by implication, a therapist develops some picture of the patient\u2019s flourishing toward which to aim, through the acquisition and cultivation of needed virtues. The task then becomes how to engage the patient in this project. Can the depressed patient see a need for hope, or self-forgiveness, or do they need the therapist to lend them hope that a better state of things is possible? Can the anxious patient believe that they can become less obsessional, or do they need to lean on the therapist\u2019s equanimity to begin to trust this possibility? Can the substance using individual accept that a sober, healthy self is worth aiming for, and benefit from the supportive experience of a group promoting virtues such as honesty, accountability and forgiveness?\n\nIn implementing a treatment plan through the use of medication, insight or support, a clinician tries to identify resources that can be recruited for the patient\u2019s full recovery, resilience and flourishing\u2014both within the therapeutic relationship and from outside it, e.g., in their community, mentors, exemplars, or experiences of faith. Within the context of treatment, psychodynamic approaches aim at character change through both insight and through corrective emotional experiences with the therapist. Schema therapy explicitly uses the therapeutic relationship to attempts to modify maladaptive ways of being in the world toward more virtuous ones. Cognitive behavioral therapy offers strategies such as practicing healthier perspectives and practices, if need be disputing the patient\u2019s resistances, to achieve change. And fourth wave approaches aimed at growth foster interventions to support virtues such as forgiveness or gratitude (4).\n\nThere are at least three ways that an emphasis on virtues can enhance treatment.\n\nFirst, acknowledging the patient\u2019s hopes for living well contextualizes them as a whole person, a task especially pertinent when trauma, adversity or illness focus attention on what matters most. Eliciting what the suffering patient most values and hopes to change, including the other-directed aims embodied in most virtues, helps to establish the therapist as a trusted ally in pursuit of not only symptom relief but a more worthwhile life.\n\nSecond, transparency about what the therapist values through demonstration of the virtues she embodies can further enhance trust and foster the internalization of qualities important to the patient\u2019s recovery. Radden and Sadler\u2019s explication of the virtues of a good psychiatrist such as trustworthiness, empathy, warmth, self-knowledge, respect, patience and perseverance provide examples of how these inform the therapist\u2019s skillful use of herself (5).\n\nThird, it can be helpful to explicitly acknowledge a place for virtues when the patient\u2019s problem has an important moral dimension. Examples include a trauma survivor\u2019s struggle with whether to forgive and reconcile; re-evaluation of the individual\u2019s priorities and life direction after a significant loss; disabling shame and guilt with a need to appreciate the virtues one continues to possess; or a disabling lack of a virtue such as accountability.\n\nTherapists can have differing moral visions, preferences for encouraging particular virtues, and different aims for their patients\u2014e.g., improved functioning, less distress, greater adaptability, enhanced flourishing, greater freedom or deeper relatedness to others. For a therapist who believes that flourishing involves pursuit of the Good, understood as what is important beyond the self, relational virtues such as compassion, love and forgiveness will carry more weight than if they envision morality to center on individual rights, and the achievement of autonomy. Preferred virtues for Jews often include communal responsibility and critical thought; for Christians, love and grace; for Muslims, reverence and obedience; for Buddhists, equanimity and compassion; for Hindus, appreciation of Dharma and Karma; and for secularists, respect for scientific evidence, autonomy, and intelligibility (6).\n\nThat world views and conceptions of the good held by therapists and their patients also differ should encourage clinicians to both be aware of the values they bring to the treatment, and to engage patients regarding these concerns not as strangers imposing a technique guided by moral neutrality, but by discussing and seeking the patient\u2019s good through wisdom, candor, and respect (7).\n\nA focus on the virtues clarifies how clinical work is both inherently moral and in important ways spiritual, and specifically how treatment that aims to promote human flourishing involves the cultivation of a mature and ethical character. Two areas for future exploration are the dynamic relationship between the therapist\u2019s and the patient\u2019s virtues, and the recruitment of resources outside the treatment to cultivate virtues. A Christian clinician, rather than promoting therapy as the complete means of acquiring needed virtues, would want to both model and encourage these, and explore what hinders the patient in finding what they need in God.",

However, more work needs to be done to understand how to incorporate a virtues based perspective into diagnostic assessment, goal-setting, and treatment.</p>\n<h2>Diagnostic Assessment and the Need for Virtues</h2>\n<p>In conducting a diagnostic assessment, mental health professionals aim to identify what enduring disposition and/or schema the patient has, and how this constitutes a strength and/or a vulnerability. Clinicians typically eschew the term \u201cvice\u201d as moralistic, but maladaptive personality traits or disorders reflect perhaps the most obvious example of a need for virtues\u2014for example, compassion in antisocial personalities, or humility in narcissistic individuals. Since a depressive disposition is often marked by guilt, inhibition and impaired self love, it often reflects a need for virtues of forgiveness, courage and love (3). Similarly, anxiety and PTSD are often accompanied by fear and distractibility, reflecting a need for equanimity, courage/defiance, and practical wisdom (phronesis) - virtues fostered by approaches such as Dialectical Behavior Therapy (DBT) and Acceptance and Commitment Therapy (ACT). Substance use disorders are often complicated by impulsivity, irresponsibility and guilt over damage done to self and others, reflecting needs for accountability, gratitude, and self-forgiveness (as encouraged by the Twelve Steps). Repair of moral injury often entails self awareness, moral integration, and re-connection to community.</p>\n<h2>Patient Cultivation of Virtues</h2>\n<p>In goal setting, a comprehensive formulation and treatment plan not only characterizes pathology, but envisions a desired, healthier version of the person and how the therapist can help them achieve it. Whether explicitly or by implication, a therapist develops some picture of the patient\u2019s flourishing toward which to aim, through the acquisition and cultivation of needed virtues. The task then becomes how to engage the patient in this project. Can the depressed patient see a need for hope, or self-forgiveness, or do they need the therapist to lend them hope that a better state of things is possible? Can the anxious patient believe that they can become less obsessional, or do they need to lean on the therapist\u2019s equanimity to begin to trust this possibility? Can the substance using individual accept that a sober, healthy self is worth aiming for, and benefit from the supportive experience of a group promoting virtues such as honesty, accountability and forgiveness?</p>\n<p>In implementing a treatment plan through the use of medication, insight or support, a clinician tries to identify resources that can be recruited for the patient\u2019s full recovery, resilience and flourishing\u2014both within the therapeutic relationship and from outside it, e.g., in their community, mentors, exemplars, or experiences of faith. Within the context of treatment, psychodynamic approaches aim at character change through both insight and through corrective emotional experiences with the therapist. Schema therapy explicitly uses the therapeutic relationship to attempts to modify maladaptive ways of being in the world toward more virtuous ones. Cognitive behavioral therapy offers strategies such as practicing healthier perspectives and practices, if need be disputing the patient\u2019s resistances, to achieve change. And fourth wave approaches aimed at growth foster interventions to support virtues such as forgiveness or gratitude (4).</p>\n<h2>Three Ways that Virtues can Enhance Treatment</h2>\n<p>There are at least three ways that an emphasis on virtues can enhance treatment.</p>\n<h3>Other-Directed Virtues for a Worthwhile Life</h3>\n<p>First, acknowledging the patient\u2019s hopes for living well contextualizes them as a whole person, a task especially pertinent when trauma, adversity or illness focus attention on what matters most. Eliciting what the suffering patient most values and hopes to change, including the other-directed aims embodied in most virtues, helps to establish the therapist as a trusted ally in pursuit of not only symptom relief but a more worthwhile life.</p>\n<h3>The Psychiatric Care-giver as an Exemplar</h3>\n<p>Second, transparency about what the therapist values through demonstration of the virtues she embodies can further enhance trust and foster the internalization of qualities important to the patient\u2019s recovery. Radden and Sadler\u2019s explication of the virtues of a good psychiatrist such as trustworthiness, empathy, warmth, self-knowledge, respect, patience and perseverance provide examples of how these inform the therapist\u2019s skillful use of herself (5).</p>\n<h3>The Salience of Virtues when Dealing with Moral Dimensions of Issues</h3>\n<p>Third, it can be helpful to explicitly acknowledge a place for virtues when the patient\u2019s problem has an important moral dimension. Examples include a trauma survivor\u2019s struggle with whether to forgive and reconcile; re-evaluation of the individual\u2019s priorities and life direction after a significant loss; disabling shame and guilt with a need to appreciate the virtues one continues to possess; or a disabling lack of a virtue such as accountability.</p>\n<h2>Differing Moral Visions and Value Preferences</h2>\n<p>Therapists can have differing moral visions, preferences for encouraging particular virtues, and different aims for their patients\u2014e.g., improved functioning, less distress, greater adaptability, enhanced flourishing, greater freedom or deeper relatedness to others. For a therapist who believes that flourishing involves pursuit of the Good, understood as what is important beyond the self, relational virtues such as compassion, love and forgiveness will carry more weight than if they envision morality to center on individual rights, and the achievement of autonomy. Preferred virtues for Jews often include communal responsibility and critical thought; for Christians, love and grace; for Muslims, reverence and obedience; for Buddhists, equanimity and compassion; for Hindus, appreciation of Dharma and Karma; and for secularists, respect for scientific evidence, autonomy, and intelligibility (6).</p>\n<p>That world views and conceptions of the good held by therapists and their patients also differ should encourage clinicians to both be aware of the values they bring to the treatment, and to engage patients regarding these concerns not as strangers imposing a technique guided by moral neutrality, but by discussing and seeking the patient\u2019s good through wisdom, candor, and respect (7).</p>\n<h2>The Way Forward</h2>\n<p>A focus on the virtues clarifies how clinical work is both inherently moral and in important ways spiritual, and specifically how treatment that aims to promote human flourishing involves the cultivation of a mature and ethical character. Two areas for future exploration are the dynamic relationship between the therapist\u2019s and the patient\u2019s virtues, and the recruitment of resources outside the treatment to cultivate virtues. A Christian clinician, rather than promoting therapy as the complete means of acquiring needed virtues, would want to both model and encourage these, and explore what hinders the patient in finding what they need in God.</p>\n<h2 class=\"new_page\">References and Further Reading</h2>"

    "bodyText": "Questions of virtue do not routinely arise in public health contexts. Supposed connections between virtue and health have sometimes come under criticism for effectively \u201cblaming the victim\u201d for poor health (Sloan, 2011; Willen, 2022). While acknowledging this concern, in this commentary, I will suggest that the empirical research on character interventions in fact provides grounds for adopting such interventions as important, albeit neglected, resources for public health, and, as I have argued elsewhere, that the reasonable concerns about blaming the victim can in fact be navigated (VanderWeele et al., 2023; VanderWeele, 2022, 2023, 2024). While I will focus primarily on the promotion of character and virtue within a pluralistic context, I will conclude with some remarks on situating character interventions within the broader context of the health of the person, and of Christian theology (cf. Herdt, 2023).\n\nNumerous individual level character-based interventions have been developed, with supporting evidence for effectiveness from randomized trials. These include interventions to promote gratitude (Davis et al., 2016; Cregg and Cheavens, 2020), kindness (Kerr et al., 2015; Lyubomirsky, Sheldon, and Schkade, 2005), forgiveness (Wade et al., 2014; Ho et al., 2024), compassion (Kirby et al., 2017), patience (Alan and Ertac, 2018), and perseverance/grit (Alan et al., 2019). Individual randomized trials, or in several cases, meta-analyses of randomized trials, have indicated evidence for effects of these character interventions on happiness, sleep, and physical health (Davis et al., 2016; Emmons and McCullough, 2003; Kirby et al., 2017; Curry et al., 2018), depression and anxiety (Wade et al., 2014; Kirby et al., 2017; Cregg and Cheavens, 2020), hope (Wade et al., 2014), and educational test scores (Alan et al., 2019).\n\nBased on this evidence, it would seem that health and well-being might be advanced by efforts to utilize and disseminate these character interventions. Such interventions could be employed in local contexts within schools, workplaces, families, religious communities and elsewhere. Campaigns to make use of these evidence-based interventions could also be carried out at local, national, and international scales. Existing evidence indicates that such interventions could be effective both in promoting these various aspects of character, but also in promoting health and well-being.\n\nAs noted above, objections are sometimes raised concerning introducing notions of character into public health or public policy or even into public discourse (Sloan, 2011; Willen, 2022). Some would prefer to refrain from even mentioning terms such as \u201cvirtue\u201d or \u201ccharacter.\u201d Concerns are raised that such notions are paternalistic; that the very idea of character is culturally relative; and that any discussion of such matters is, once again, likely to result in blaming the victim. These are important concerns, but the appropriate response is arguably to more sensitively address these issues surrounding character, rather than to abandon such notions altogether.\n\nWhile there will inevitably be differences in the character strengths that are valued across societies, cross-cultural research suggests that there is a lot that is held in common including valuing courage, justice, humanity, temperance, wisdom, and transcendence (Dahslgaard et al., 2005). Moreover, for virtues such as courage, wisdom, and justice, if one were to ask who wanted to pursue these versus instead being cowardly, foolish, and unjust, one would get very few opting for the latter (cf. VanderWeele, 2022). There is variation in precisely how these virtues are understood, but that virtue is important, and that these specific virtues are important, is shared across cultures. It is perhaps only in circles of the contemporary West that one finds any hesitation (VanderWeele et al., 2023).\n\nLikewise, while attributing poor health to poor character is often inappropriate (Sloan, 2011; Willen, 2022), that does not mean that character is irrelevant, or that we cannot seek to develop character within ourselves and promote character strengths within society more generally. One can strongly affirm that not every instance of ill-health is due to a failing of one\u2019s own character, while still acknowledging the potential that character interventions might hold in making positive contributions to health and well-being. To not utilize such character interventions\u2014in schools or workplaces, say\u2014is to neglect an important and powerful tool to enhance flourishing throughout society. Character is important for our own lives, and it is especially critical for those who are in positions of power and influence, if we are to work towards a better society. Neglect of matters of character will impoverish us and our communities.\n\nWhile these character promotion intervention efforts are valuable and could arguably be much more powerfully leveraged than is the case at present, character and virtue are ultimately developed and shaped over the course of a lifetime. Relationships, communities, and institutions play a critical role in the development and formation of character. Efforts to promote character development at local, national, and international scales can make use of the existing and future evidence-based character interventions. However, because of the important role communities, relationships, and institutions play in the formation of character, efforts to promote character should also foster and encourage community participation and acknowledge their critical role in development and formation and this too can be acknowledged within public health contexts (Rozier, 2016; Daly, 2011). These various efforts to promote character development have considerable potential to foster not only physical health, but the health of the person as well.\n\nGood character, or virtue, is of course not only instrumentally valuable, but intrinsically important in its own right. Character itself might be understood as the sum of the moral and mental qualities which distinguish an individual (Oxford English Dictionary, 1989), and virtue as a habit in accord with reason to attain the good (Aquinas, 1274/1948). Both the classical tradition (Aristotle, 4th-C BCE/1925) and the Christian tradition (Aquinas, 1274/1948; cf. Herdt, 2023) effectively envision flourishing as the development and exercise of the virtues, with the Christian tradition making the theological virtues of faith, hope, and love central (Aquinas, 1274/1948). Understood this way, virtue is a constitutive part of flourishing, of the health of the person. Failures of character or virtue, which inevitably arise, are a deviation from what God intended, and constitute sin. Christians, however, believe that God has, through the life, death and resurrection of Jesus Christ, and the ongoing work of the Church and the Spirit, provided a means to address such sin and to bring about a restoration to God\u2019s intent. From the standpoint of Christian theology, spiritual transformation, the life of the Church, and the work of the Spirit can powerfully shape character, both assisting in the developing of virtue and the infusing of virtues with an orientation towards more ultimate and supernatural ends (Aquinas, 1274/1948).\n\nAnd indeed the empirical literature provides strong support for church attendance contributing to character and to other aspects of health and well-being (VanderWeele, 2017ab; Koenig et al., 2024). We are moreover to steward our knowledge and resources well, and this then arguably also entails a making use of the evidence-based character interventions described above to promote both character and also the health and well-being of society. The promotion of character and virtue is arguably important within pluralistic public health contexts, but it is absolutely essential for a genuinely Christian theology of health (VanderWeele, 2024).\n\nAlan, S., Boneva, T., & Ertac, S.

    "bodyText": "We suspect that most economists, both academic and professional, if asked to comment on the role of the virtues in economics, would look somewhat surprised to be asked, as the virtues do not figure in the standard frameworks of economics as currently practiced. The exception might be those whose training has included the history of economic thought, and might be aware that there was an older discourse which did address the role of the market in fostering good behaviour in economic activity, and a later discourse which understood the market as being inimical to virtuous behaviour.\n\nThe purpose of this brief is to provide signposts to these older literatures, and to indicate that the collective amnesia in the profession is a mistake: there are significant issues that need to be revisited if we are to understand the functioning of market capitalism now. First, we will sketch the debate that emerged in the late 18C, and took a different turn in the 19C. A particular emphasis will be on the role of Adam Smith as one of the early economists in the modern era who entered the debate. We will also briefly consider why the rhetoric about the virtues in markets disappeared from the mainstream economics narrative. Second, we will consider contributions to a recent literature which have attempted to reinstate the virtues as part of the discipline. Third, we will consider another recent literature, which explores the question: \u2018Why good incentives are no substitutes for good citizens\u2019 (Samuel Bowles (2016)). This literature owes a good deal to very recent developments in game theory, economics of information, and behavioural economics.\n\nThose who wish to trace the history of ideas about virtues in markets the 18C and 19C are greatly in the debt of A O Hirschman, who provided an illuminating narrative in a classic article published in 1982. There were, according to Hirschman, two narratives in play.\n\nThe first is the doux commerce narrative which views commerce as a civilising agent of considerable power and range. The story begins with key sentences from Montesquieu The Spirit of the Laws , written in 1749:\n\n\u2018.. it is almost a general rule that wherever manners are gentle ( moeurs douces) there is commerce, and wherever there is commerce, manners are gentle\u2019\n\n\u2018Commerce \u2026 polishes and softens barbaric ways as we can see every day\u2019.\n\nHirschman notes that this view was accepted unquestioningly by subsequent thinkers. The causation was mainly from commerce to good character and behaviour, but there was a reinforcing causation in the other direction. The key idea is that commerce brings people together for mutual benefit and that makes them more honest, reliable, self-disciplined, orderly, friendly, and helpful, and desiring to avoid conflict. That in turn enables markets to function better.\n\nThe second is the self-destruction narrative. The narrative can also be traced back to 19C thinkers, including Karl Marx who railed against the impact of commerce on social relations, with market exchanges crowding out traditional values such as love, family, concern for others, and patriotism. In market exchanges, the virtues were entirely absent in the behaviour of the participants:\n\n\u2018\u2026 The bourgeoisie, wherever it has got the upper hand, has put an end to all feudal, patriarchal, idyllic relations. It has pitilessly torn asunder the motley feudal ties that bound man to his \u2018natural superiors\u2019, and has left no other nexus between people than naked self-interest, than callous \u2018cash payment\u2019. It has drowned out the most heavenly ecstasies of religious fervour, of chivalrous enthusiasm, of philistine sentimentalism, in the icy water of egotistical calculation\u2019 (Marx and Engels, 1848, p. 13-14)\n\nAmbivalence about the links between markets and virtue (or lack of it), is also evident in the writings of Adam Smith. The exegetical literature on the matter is too extensive to summarise here, but there is a paradox that some read Smith as supporting the doux commerce thesis while others argue that Smith suggested that markets tended to undermine virtues, the origins of which lay outside markets. The paradox has been illuminated by a study by Graafland and Wells (2021) who have used a \u2018semantic network data-mining approach\u2019 to study the text of The Wealth of Nations. The methods \u2018allow us to analyze what Smith meant by examining empirically (quantitatively) what he said \u2019 [p 32]. The units of analysis are the numbered paragraphs in the text, which are extensively utilised in Smith scholarship. A detailed scan of the text identified the terms that Smith used to refer to the market economy, the virtues/vices, and societal flourishing (defined much more broadly than the economist\u2019s preoccupation with productivity, wealth, and factors of production). The method then picked up the linkages between these terms in each paragraph. The results showed that in 60% of instances, free markets are associated with virtues, but in 40% the association is with vices.\n\nThe next step was to consider the association of virtues with societal flourishing: the association is overwhelmingly positive. The authors point out that this contrasts with Mandeville\u2019s parable of the hive, which Smith is often said to have endorsed: that private vices like vanity, selfishness and even dishonesty can be conducive to economic flourishing. Their next enquiry was to ask which virtues were thought by Smith to be conducive to societal flourishing. As expected, temperance and prudence emerge strongly in his writings. Perhaps less expected is a relatively strong showing for benevolence ; for Smith the virtues of care and kindness to others are important, which contradicts the oft-asserted view that he thought the pursuit of self-interest was integral to a successful economy.\n\nThese findings of Graafland and Wells (and there is much more detail than can be reported here) enabled the authors to address the \u2018 doux commerce \u2019 and \u2018 self-destruction \u2019 theses in Smith. Their conclusion is he referred more frequently to the former, but was also very alert to the latter. Notably Smith was concerned that the two virtues of temperance and benevolence were vulnerable in free markets.\n\nSo how was it that these ideas of the 18C economists were forgotten or abandoned by the economics profession in the 19C and beyond? Hirschman has made some suggestions. First, the experience of the industrial revolution did much to destroy the optimism of the doux commerce thesis: it did not look as if the rampant capitalism which emerged had much to do with virtuous actors. Second, economists ignored the emerging sociological literature which suggested that division of labour required a degree of social coordination, and that market contracting generated social relations between the contracting parties. The presumed fissiparous tendencies of the market did not entirely undermine the social solidarity that market contracting required. Third, the development of economic theory, especially in the first part of the 20C, emphasised the market model of \u2018perfect competition\u2019, which assumes anonymity of buyers and sellers, and the absence of any communication between them. The model was favoured for its supposed property of optimal allocation of resources, rather than its descriptive realism. In the past fifty years of economic theory, the need to model markets more appropriately has given rise to game theory, information economics, and behavioural economics: knowing with whom you are transacting in the market is often central to the concerns of the analyses, not least knowing if you can trust them.\n\nIn her book, The Bourgeois Virtues: Ethics for an Age of Commerce , Deirdre McCloskey (2006) presents a robust defence of the market capitalist economy as it developed in Western economies, notably since the 18C. Her claim, contra the critics of capitalism who claimed that markets were destructive of virtue, was that markets as they have developed are in fact both permissive of and conducive to virtuous behaviour, and dependent on virtues for their successful functioning. She presents a strong version of the doux commerce thesis. Her arguments are based on her observation of the historical and contemporary functioning of markets, particularly in North America but also in Europe, notably historically in Amsterdam, and a sharp critique of those who appeal to a priori arguments often based in economic theory as it developed in the 20C. She has little time for the utilitarian thinking that has become one of the foundations of modern theory, which she characterises as \u2018Prudence Only\u2019. Her method is to explore one at a time what she identifies as the seven Classical and Christian virtues, explaining how they are present in market economies, and (to a lesser extent) how they are sustained in such economies. Here we will outline her treatment of three of these \u2018virtues\u2019 to illustrate her thinking (but this will not capture the full riches of her writing).\n\nLove She begins her review of the virtues with Love, noting that this virtue is generally dismissed in standard theory with its emphasis on \u2018rational economic man\u2019 who seeks only their own self-interest. Her assertion is that the \u2018love\u2019 for other economic actors that emerges from game theory models is inadequate to the task of explaining the level of trust that underpins markets: experimental games with real participants show that they behave in disinterested ways, motivated by some notion of what might be a \u2018fair outcome\u2019. McCloskey calls this \u2018solidarity\u2019. Moreover, regard for others is central to living a flourishing life in areas that have little to do with commerce or other economic activities. Her critique applies particularly to economists like Becker (1981, 1993), who have sought to apply rational economics to modelling marriage, divorce, and the family [reference required]. She also questions the thesis of sociologists/ economists like Bellah (1996) and Putnam (2010) that the fragmentation arising from reliance on markets alone has led to a loss of social solidarity, describing it as social science \u2018myth\u2019 with little supporting evidence.\n\nCourage She sees the virtue of courage evidenced in entrepreneurial behaviour, either in the face of competition from others in a market, or more directly in the pursuit of new business ventures. She notes that business people delight in pursuing \u2018new ventures\u2019 for their own sake, not just for the financial rewards that they bring. The point is that market capitalism provides a context in which this kind of courage can be exercised, and indeed that it is essential to the functioning of a successful market economy in terms of competition and innovation. She also warns that this kind of courage can become all-absorbing, resulting in pride, covetousness, envy, and greed. It needs to be balanced by other virtues such as temperance and justice. But too much temperance can crowd out courage, leading to timidity, sloth, and an unwillingness to experiment, leading to a stagnant economy which lacks innovation and energy. It is an important part of her message that the virtues come as a set, and all need to act in concert, without giving undue weight to any single virtue in the behaviour of individuals and groups.\n\nPrudence As might be anticipated, McCloskey gives considerable attention to the virtue of prudence, given its prominence in Adam Smith. The usual definition of prudence is \u2018good judgment\u2019 or \u2018practical wisdom\u2019. It might be thought that this is not a virtue, but just a display of common sense in market behaviour. But it does have a moral dimension, in the sense of an obligation to self-development, and to use wisely the gifts, training and experience that one brings to a market economy. That will hopefully bring a financial reward, but acting prudently is its own reward in building up the virtuous character. This contrasts with the utilitarian focus of modern economics on actions that enhance a person\u2019s wealth, or satisfaction with the goods that can be acquired with the financial gains from entering the market.\n\nMcCloskey draws together her assessment of the role of the virtues in market by suggesting that in actual markets (as opposed to the theoretical constructions of neoclassical economists) a full range of virtues are displayed \u2013 the so-called Christian virtues of love, hope and faith, and the pagan values of courage, temperance, prudence, and justice. Not all will be present to the same degree, but as she takes some pains to illustrate, they work together, and all are necessary to the good functioning of the market system. They are also all present as motivations for market behaviour. She makes a distinction between prudence (P), and what she terms solidarity values (S) such as society, sympathy, stewardship, sharing and other sacred values which motivate behaviour, and argues that both are needed to explain what happens in actual markets. Her criticism of neoclassical economics is that it ignores S, and simply presumes that those values can be identified as \u2018tastes\u2019 which do not need further interrogation. She identifies cases where behaviour cannot be understood without unpacking S: the most ubiquitous example is relationships within the family, which cannot, pace Gary Becker, be explained without appeal to other virtues such as love, hope and justice.\n\nIt is hard to do justice to the scope and depth of McCloskey\u2019s book in a few short summary paragraphs. Our assessment is that her critique of \u2018Prudence only\u2019 as the basis for much thinking about market economies and societies is largely correct. She is right to draw attention to the presence of other virtues that motivate people in their economic activities, and which also serve to temper the tendency to excess of a focus solely on production and consumption. But she does not, in our view, demonstrate conclusively that the S virtues will emerge in the functioning of markets: that they are present is undeniable, but they could be nurtured elsewhere in a community or culture, and imported into market behaviours. Nor does she demonstrate that the market, motivated by prudence only (price, satisfaction, pleasure, utility) will not tend to destroy the S values as the self-destruction thesis asserts.\n\nBruni and Sugden (2013) note that economic analysis has been critiqued for its reliance on instrumental rationality (\u2018rational economic man\u2019) and on extrinsic motivations (such as pursuit of profit or utility). That analysis fails to understand that market transactions are human practices with their own values and intrinsic motivations. To address this richer understanding, the authors appeal to Macintyre\u2019s definition of a \u2018practice\u2019, defined as \u2018a coherent and complex form of socially established cooperative activity\u2019. They argue that markets are such a \u2018practice\u2019 which has its own intrinsic values and standards of excellence that enables the purposes of the activity to be pursued.\n\nThe first step is to uncover the telos of the market. The authors note that the fundamental purpose of markets is to facilitate mutually beneficial voluntary transactions. The building blocks of elementary economic analysis include the famous \u2018Edgeworth Box\u2019 diagram which illustrates the mutual gains from exchange between two persons, and the Ricardian gains from trade between nations arising from comparative advantage. Market participants understand that transactions bring mutual benefits to the transactors, and that this motivates their market behaviour. Implicit in actual market behaviour are values such as universality, enterprise, alertness, respect for other\u2019s preferences, trust, trustworthiness, acceptance of competition, self-help, and the stoical acceptance of outcomes.\n\nIt is worth looking at some of these in more detail to understand the role they play in markets. Universality is the disposition to make mutually beneficial trades with others on terms of equality, without discrimination. Trust and trustworthiness come into play in the common situations where monitoring and enforcement of contracts or deals is difficult or prohibitively expensive. If you cannot trust the other party, then trade will not take place. Acceptance of competition i nvolves the realisation and acceptance that other parties are not obliged to enter trades with you if there are better offers from other traders in the market. Self help is the understanding that you can only realise gains from trade if you have something (a good or a service, or labour) to offer in exchange. Acceptance of outcomes is just that: some deals will work out well, and others less well. There is no basis for an attitude that presumes that a trader is entitled to a particular return just because they entered the market. Nor should a trader be envious if some others prosper more than they do. Uncertainty (and luck?) are pervasive in trading.\n\nReflecting on our experience of markets, it is evident that a market economy would not function without these values; it is rather strange that they seldom feature in the teaching of elementary economics. The questions then are how these values can be turned into virtues exhibited by market actors, where \u2018virtues\u2019 are settled dispositions to act in accord with those values; and whether, as explored above, markets are supportive or undermining of those virtues.\n\nBehavioural economics and the economics of information have begun to address these issues. For example, there is an extensive literature in game theory about the emergence of trust: in principle, people can be cajoled into being trustworthy in situations where they are hoping to have a continuing presence in a market over time, and where information about deception or failure to fulfil promises is widely available to others in the market. [See Nowak and Highfield (2011) for a highly readable non-technical exposition.] Note, of course, that acting \u2018well\u2019 in such circumstances has nothing to do with virtue: it arises out of pure self-interest. There is also a literature that suggests that virtue is eroded where market incentives are introduced. The most quoted example is the Haifa creche. The creche had a problem with parents arriving late to pick up their offspring, so instituted fines for late collection. To their dismay the problem got worse. Parents interpreted the fine as a price for an additional service, for which they were willing to pay the fine. The introduction of the fine changed the mindset: previously arriving late was regarded as a failure to act appropriately towards the staff, but that was undermined. Sadly, when the fine was suspended, parents continued to arrive late in even greater numbers, because the virtue of being punctual and conscientious towards the creche staff had disappeared. The literature has moved towards accepting that market participants cannot always be relied on to behave virtuously, so the emphasis is on the development of mechanisms to reduce the impacts.\n\nIt is unclear (at least to us!) whether Bruni and Sugden are going beyond a conclusion that without virtues relating to mutual benefits from cooperation in trades the market will not function effectively according to its telos, to an expectation that these virtues will arise from the experience of market activity as participants recognise that virtuous behaviour is necessary to sustain the markets over time. The problem is that introduction of extrinsic motivations such as monetary gains or profits can easily displace good behaviour: even if bad actors will eventually be identified, they may have been able to make sufficient short-term gains not to care about being exposed, as they can retire with their ill-gotten loot!\n\nIn his 2016 book, The Moral Economy: Why good incentives are no substitute for good citizens, Samuel Bowles gives a comprehensive discussion of why the doux commerce thesis might not work in economies that emphasise incentives in the functioning of markets. He reviews evidence from \u2018laboratory\u2019 experiments which involve participants in playing games involving making economic decisions. The evidence is clear that offering a monetary incentive to participants based on their \u2018success\u2019 in the games, no matter how small the incentive, tends to crowd out altruism (he terms this \u2018categorical crowding out\u2019), and that the bigger the incentive offered, the larger the degree of crowding out (\u2018marginal crowding out\u2019).\n\nHe offers a range of suggestions for these findings. The first suggestion is that incentives provide information about the situational set up in the game, and so in some situations crowd out moral sentiments because it is appropriate not to be morally concerned: it is appropriate to be self-interested in the supermarket, but not within a family setting. The second suggestion is that incentives alter the process of learning to act morally, and so alters the weight given to altruism in the person\u2019s preferences. The third is that the offering of incentives is taken to provide information about the designer of the incentive, in particular the intended effect on the agent, and about the nature and purpose of the task to be performed: that information may be construed as playing down or even eliminating moral sentiments. The fourth suggestion is that incentives can lead to moral disengagement: if markets are believed to be places where agents act without moral consideration, then even a morally alert agent may act as if moral concerns are not relevant. Fifth, incentives may compromise agency: if the incentives give a self-interested reason for something that the agent would have done altruistically, then the agent may become cynical about their motives and allow it to undermine their sense of altruism. Finally, in his listing of suggestions, Bowles notes that incentives fire up the deliberative part of the brain, whereas the emotional part of the brain is more effective in prompting altruistic behaviour. Strong incentives may effectively silence those promptings.\n\nThis analysis leaves a question about how it is that market-based cultures in the West do have cultural norms that support good citizens, and at the same time rely on markets for economic and social interactions. If the presence of market incentives undermines altruism (the \u2018self-destruction\u2019 thesis) then how does it come about that what is observed is closer to doux commerce ? He explores this in a seminal paper (2011) which asks the question \u2018Is liberal society a parasite on tradition?\u2019. The paper reports studies that show unequivocally that market incentives crowd out moral motives. But it also presents convincing evidence from international comparisons of different societies that it is precisely the market based liberal societies that most exhibit civic virtues conducive to the functioning of markets. How can these contrasting pieces of evidence be reconciled?\n\nBowles answer is that there is co-evolution between the development of market economies, and the rise of social institutions such as private property and the rule of law, which mutually support and strengthen each other. In this he finds support in the Enlightenment narratives put forward by secular humanists, that moral sentiments can thrive in social culture. His contention is that liberal institutions counteract and more than compensate for any \u2018parasitic\u2019 effect of markets on virtues. He dismisses the alternative argument that the development of markets grew out of the social cultures of traditional societies.\n\nNotably he does not address the much-contested sociological argument that there has been a historic link between Protestantism and the rise of market economies in the West, as famously proposed by the sociologist Max Weber in the The Protestant Ethic and the Spirit of Capitalism (English translation 1938), and meticulously explored by R H Tawney in Religion and the Rise of Capitalism (1926, 1938). [\u00a01\u00a0] The proposition is that the Reformation values of work as a \u2018calling\u2019, avoidance of personal extravagance and waste, upholding the ideals of integrity, truthfulness and honesty in market dealings, and an obligation to care for the other parties to a transaction, all enabled markets to function effectively and prevented opportunistic behaviour.\n\nFred Hirsch in his Social Limits to Growth (1977) also addressed the issue of the erosion of moral restraints in markets, and how that might be reversed. He is clear that a moral basis is needed if markets are not to be undermined by opportunistic behaviour on the part of participants. It can only operate successfully if there is general acceptance of standards of honesty, truth, trust, and absence of intimidation. While standards can be reinforced by a body of law, e.g. contract law, consumer protection, that is not sufficient in the absence of social consent. The entry of legal procedures into every contract would undermine the advantages of decentralised economic decision making, which is perceived to be the special genius of markets. Hirsch\u2019s thesis is that market capitalism originally succeeded because it had inherited a strong religious and moral framework, which served to prevent the pursuit of self-interest. However, with the erosion of religious sanctions, the market begins to operate less effectively for the reasons outlined in the \u2018self-destruction\u2019 thesis, and market behaviour begins to invade non-market areas. An interesting consequence is that without an ethic that sees the payment of taxes as a social responsibility, tax evasion and tax avoidance become the norm, and attract an even more complex structure of tax law to try to close the loopholes. Hirsch points to the decline of traditional Christian morality as the source of these problems, but has little to suggest how the situation might be rectified. At best he comments that a new social ethic is needed urgently, and optimistically asserts: \u2018The functional need for change in social ethic can be expected, over time, to promote it\u2019.\n\nIn a provocative article (2011), Bowles outlines some evidence that markets crowd out virtues, but then attributes their overall success in western societies to the effect of also crowding out 'traditions'. What he means by traditions relates to the anthropological category of 'lineal-segmented societies'. These are societies based on related clusters of families who in the distant past exercised loyalty to the 'in' group and hostility to the 'out' group. \u00a0Bowles notes that advocates of traditional values/societies often idealize them, and do not notice their more destructive tendencies, typical of lineal-segmented societies, such as a lack of respect for outsiders, the rule of law, or inclusive social decision making. Thus, secularized societies may be impacted negatively by markets crowding out virtues, but the retreat of \u2018traditions\u2019 more than offsets this. His argument is in contradiction to the Weber thesis, because he does not distinguish between traditions which are akin to mafia clans (lineal-segmented societies), and traditions such as Protestantism which encourage commerce by treating 'in' and 'out' people equally as bearers of the image of God, and so are consistent with inclusion, trust and other market-friendly virtues.\n\nThis brief review of the relevant literature suggests that the ignorance of most economists about the virtues is a serious shortcoming. There is sufficient evidence to show that the \u2018self-destruction\u2019 effect in market economies is likely to be widespread in economic behaviour, and that the more optimistic doux commerce effect is present, but is probably not robust unless sustained by a moral framework imported from outside the market.\n\nOne solution is to seek to design market institutions and mechanisms to counter bad behaviour, so giving incentives to act well. A common response by the political authorities is to resort to law and regulation, seeking to counter damaging behaviours (such as corruption), or to constrain agents to behave in ways that are beneficial to all market participants. The danger is that regulation (and even more, legal constraints) will become a costly intervention which will undermine the market freedoms that underpin market capitalism. Moreover, as the experience of regulation amply demonstrates, the framing of rules can just give the regulated an incentive to seek ways around the rules, with costs both for the regulator and the regulated. The alternative is to seek ways of encouraging people to be \u2018good citizens\u2019 who care about the others with whom they are transacting in markets. The literature strongly suggests that historically it was external moral codes coming from religious cultures, such as the Reformation, that formed the emergence of \u2018good citizens\u2019. The optimism of some writers that secular moral codes can take the place of religious codes seems to us to be a triumph of optimism over a realistic assessment of the economic world in which humankind now lives.\n\n[\u00a01\u00a0] See Whinster (2005/6) for an account of the related contributions of Weber and Tawney.\n\nBowles S (2011), Is liberal society a parasite on tradition?

    "bodyHtml": "<p>We suspect that most economists, both academic and professional, if asked to comment on the role of the virtues in economics, would look somewhat surprised to be asked, as the virtues do not figure in the standard frameworks of economics as currently practiced. The exception might be those whose training has included the history of economic thought, and might be aware that there was an older discourse which did address the role of the market in fostering good behaviour in economic activity, and a later discourse which understood the market as being inimical to virtuous behaviour.</p>\n<p>The purpose of this brief is to provide signposts to these older literatures, and to indicate that the collective amnesia in the profession is a mistake: there are significant issues that need to be revisited if we are to understand the functioning of market capitalism now. First, we will sketch the debate that emerged in the late 18C, and took a different turn in the 19C. A particular emphasis will be on the role of Adam Smith as one of the early economists in the modern era who entered the debate. We will also briefly consider why the rhetoric about the virtues in markets disappeared from the mainstream economics narrative. Second, we will consider contributions to a recent literature which have attempted to reinstate the virtues as part of the discipline. Third, we will consider another recent literature, which explores the question: \u2018Why good incentives are no substitutes for good citizens\u2019 (Samuel Bowles (2016)). This literature owes a good deal to very recent developments in game theory, economics of information, and behavioural economics.</p>\n<h2><em><strong>Doux commerce</strong></em><strong>\u2019 versus \u2018self destruction\u2019</strong></h2>\n<p>Those who wish to trace the history of ideas about virtues in markets the 18C and 19C are greatly in the debt of A O Hirschman, who provided an illuminating narrative in a classic article published in 1982. There were, according to Hirschman, two narratives in play.</p>\n<h3>Montesquieu on Commerce as Civilising\u00a0</h3>\n<p>The first is the <em>doux commerce</em> narrative which views commerce as a civilising agent of considerable power and range. The story begins with key sentences from Montesquieu <em><u>The Spirit of the Laws</u></em>, written in 1749:</p>\n<blockquote><p>\u2018.. it is almost a general rule that wherever manners are gentle (<em>moeurs douces)</em> there is commerce, and wherever there is commerce, manners are gentle\u2019</p></blockquote>\n<p>\u2018.. it is almost a general rule that wherever manners are gentle (<em>moeurs douces)</em> there is commerce, and wherever there is commerce, manners are gentle\u2019</p>\n<blockquote><p>\u2018Commerce \u2026 polishes and softens barbaric ways as we can see every day\u2019.</p></blockquote>\n<p>\u2018Commerce \u2026 polishes and softens barbaric ways as we can see every day\u2019.</p>\n<p>Hirschman notes that this view was accepted unquestioningly by subsequent thinkers. The causation was mainly from commerce to good character and behaviour, but there was a reinforcing causation in the other direction. The key idea is that commerce brings people together for mutual benefit and that makes them more honest, reliable, self-disciplined, orderly, friendly, and helpful, and desiring to avoid conflict. That in turn enables markets to function better.</p>\n<h3>Marx and self-destruction</h3>\n<p>The second is the <em>self-destruction </em>narrative. The narrative can also be traced back to 19C thinkers, including Karl Marx who railed against the impact of commerce on social relations, with market exchanges crowding out traditional values such as love, family, concern for others, and patriotism. In market exchanges, the virtues were entirely absent in the behaviour of the participants:</p>\n<blockquote><p>\u2018\u2026 The bourgeoisie, wherever it has got the upper hand, has put an end to all feudal, patriarchal, idyllic relations. It has pitilessly torn asunder the motley feudal ties that bound man to his \u2018natural superiors\u2019, and has left no other nexus between people than naked self-interest, than callous \u2018cash payment\u2019. It has drowned out the most heavenly ecstasies of religious fervour, of chivalrous enthusiasm, of philistine sentimentalism, in the icy water of egotistical calculation\u2019 (Marx and Engels, 1848, p. 13-14)</p></blockquote>\n<p>\u2018\u2026 The bourgeoisie, wherever it has got the upper hand, has put an end to all feudal, patriarchal, idyllic relations. It has pitilessly torn asunder the motley feudal ties that bound man to his \u2018natural superiors\u2019, and has left no other nexus between people than naked self-interest, than callous \u2018cash payment\u2019. It has drowned out the most heavenly ecstasies of religious fervour, of chivalrous enthusiasm, of philistine sentimentalism, in the icy water of egotistical calculation\u2019 (Marx and Engels, 1848, p. 13-14)</p>\n<h3>Adam Smith on Virtue and Vice</h3>\n<p>Ambivalence about the links between markets and virtue (or lack of it), is also evident in the writings of Adam Smith. The exegetical literature on the matter is too extensive to summarise here, but there is a paradox that some read Smith as supporting the <em>doux commerce</em> thesis while others argue that Smith suggested that markets tended to undermine virtues, the origins of which lay outside markets. The paradox has been illuminated by a study by Graafland and Wells (2021) who have used a \u2018semantic network data-mining approach\u2019 to study the text of <em>The Wealth of Nations. </em>The methods \u2018allow us to analyze what Smith <em>meant</em> by examining empirically (quantitatively) what he <em>said</em>\u2019 [p 32]. The units of analysis are the numbered paragraphs in the text, which are extensively utilised in Smith scholarship. A detailed scan of the text identified the terms that Smith used to refer to the market economy, the virtues/vices, and societal flourishing (defined much more broadly than the economist\u2019s preoccupation with productivity, wealth, and factors of production). The method then picked up the linkages between these terms in each paragraph. The results showed that in 60% of instances, free markets are associated with virtues, but in 40% the association is with vices.</p>\n<p>The next step was to consider the association of virtues with societal flourishing: the association is overwhelmingly positive. The authors point out that this contrasts with Mandeville\u2019s parable of the hive, which Smith is often said to have endorsed: that private vices like vanity, selfishness and even dishonesty can be conducive to economic flourishing. Their next enquiry was to ask which virtues were thought by Smith to be conducive to societal flourishing. As expected, <em>temperance</em> and <em>prudence</em> emerge strongly in his writings. Perhaps less expected is a relatively strong showing for <em>benevolence</em>; for Smith the virtues of care and kindness to others are important, which contradicts the oft-asserted view that he thought the pursuit of self-interest was integral to a successful economy.</p>\n<h2><strong>Why 18<sup>th</sup> Century Ideas were Abandoned</strong></h2>\n<p>These findings of Graafland and Wells (and there is much more detail than can be reported here) enabled the authors to address the \u2018<em>doux commerce</em>\u2019 and \u2018<em>self-destruction</em>\u2019 theses in Smith. Their conclusion is he referred more frequently to the former, but was also very alert to the latter. Notably Smith was concerned that the two virtues of temperance and benevolence were vulnerable in free markets.</p>\n<p>So how was it that these ideas of the 18C economists were forgotten or abandoned by the economics profession in the 19C and beyond? Hirschman has made some suggestions. First, the experience of the industrial revolution did much to destroy the optimism of the <em>doux commerce </em>thesis: it did not <em>look</em> as if the rampant capitalism which emerged had much to do with virtuous actors. Second, economists ignored the emerging sociological literature which suggested that division of labour required a degree of social coordination, and that market contracting generated social relations between the contracting parties. The presumed fissiparous tendencies of the market did not entirely undermine the social solidarity that market contracting required. Third, the development of economic theory, especially in the first part of the 20C, emphasised the market model of \u2018perfect competition\u2019, which assumes anonymity of buyers and sellers, and the absence of any communication between them. The model was favoured for its supposed property of optimal allocation of resources, rather than its descriptive realism. In the past fifty years of economic theory, the need to model markets more appropriately has given rise to game theory, information economics, and behavioural economics: knowing with whom you are transacting in the market is often central to the concerns of the analyses, not least knowing if you can trust them.</p>\n<h2>Revisiting the Virtues in Economics</h2>\n<h3>The Bourgeois Virtues</h3>\n<p>In her book, <em>The Bourgeois Virtues: Ethics for an Age of Commerce</em>, Deirdre McCloskey (2006)<em> </em>presents a robust defence of the market capitalist economy as it developed in Western economies, notably since the 18C. Her claim, contra the critics of capitalism who claimed that markets were destructive of virtue, was that markets as they have developed are in fact both permissive of and conducive to virtuous behaviour, and dependent on virtues for their successful functioning. She presents a strong version of the <em>doux commerce </em>thesis. Her arguments are based on her observation of the historical and contemporary functioning of markets, particularly in North America but also in Europe, notably historically in Amsterdam, and a sharp critique of those who appeal to <em>a priori</em> arguments often based in economic theory as it developed in the 20C. She has little time for the utilitarian thinking that has become one of the foundations of modern theory, which she characterises as \u2018Prudence Only\u2019. Her method is to explore one at a time what she identifies as the seven Classical and Christian virtues, explaining how they are present in market economies, and (to a lesser extent) how they are sustained in such economies. Here we will outline her treatment of three of these \u2018virtues\u2019 to illustrate her thinking (but this will not capture the full riches of her writing).</p>\n<p><strong>Love </strong>She begins her review of the virtues with Love, noting that this virtue is generally dismissed in standard theory with its emphasis on \u2018rational economic man\u2019 who seeks only their own self-interest. Her assertion is that the \u2018love\u2019 for other economic actors that emerges from game theory models is inadequate to the task of explaining the level of trust that underpins markets: experimental games with real participants show that they behave in disinterested ways, motivated by some notion of what might be a \u2018fair outcome\u2019. McCloskey calls this \u2018solidarity\u2019. Moreover, regard for others is central to living a flourishing life in areas that have little to do with commerce or other economic activities. Her critique applies particularly to economists like Becker (1981, 1993), who have sought to apply rational economics to modelling marriage, divorce, and the family [reference required]. She also questions the thesis of sociologists/ economists like Bellah (1996) and Putnam (2010) that the fragmentation arising from reliance on markets alone has led to a loss of social solidarity, describing it as social science \u2018myth\u2019 with little supporting evidence.</p>\n<p><strong>Courage </strong>She sees the virtue of courage evidenced in entrepreneurial behaviour, either in the face of competition from others in a market, or more directly in the pursuit of new business ventures. She notes that business people delight in pursuing \u2018new ventures\u2019 for their own sake, not just for the financial rewards that they bring. The point is that market capitalism provides a context in which this kind of courage can be exercised, and indeed that it is essential to the functioning of a successful market economy in terms of competition and innovation. She also warns that this kind of courage can become all-absorbing, resulting in pride, covetousness, envy, and greed. It needs to be balanced by other virtues such as temperance and justice. But too much temperance can crowd out courage, leading to timidity, sloth, and an unwillingness to experiment, leading to a stagnant economy which lacks innovation and energy. It is an important part of her message that the virtues come as a set, and all need to act in concert, without giving undue weight to any single virtue in the behaviour of individuals and groups.</p>\n<p><strong>Prudence </strong>As might be anticipated, McCloskey gives considerable attention to the virtue of prudence, given its prominence in Adam Smith. The usual definition of prudence is \u2018good judgment\u2019 or \u2018practical wisdom\u2019. It might be thought that this is not a virtue, but just a display of common sense in market behaviour. But it does have a moral dimension, in the sense of an obligation to self-development, and to use wisely the gifts, training and experience that one brings to a market economy. That will hopefully bring a financial reward, but acting prudently is its own reward in building up the virtuous character. This contrasts with the utilitarian focus of modern economics on actions that enhance a person\u2019s wealth, or satisfaction with the goods that can be acquired with the financial gains from entering the market.</p>\n<p>McCloskey draws together her assessment of the role of the virtues in market by suggesting that in actual markets (as opposed to the theoretical constructions of neoclassical economists) a full range of virtues are displayed \u2013 the so-called Christian virtues of love, hope and faith, and the pagan values of courage, temperance, prudence, and justice. Not all will be present to the same degree, but as she takes some pains to illustrate, they work together, and all are necessary to the good functioning of the market system. They are also all present as motivations for market behaviour. She makes a distinction between prudence (P), and what she terms solidarity values (S) such as society, sympathy, stewardship, sharing and other sacred values which motivate behaviour, and argues that both are needed to explain what happens in actual markets. Her criticism of neoclassical economics is that it ignores S, and simply presumes that those values can be identified as \u2018tastes\u2019 which do not need further interrogation. She identifies cases where behaviour cannot be understood without unpacking S: the most ubiquitous example is relationships within the family, which cannot, <em>pace</em> Gary Becker, be explained without appeal to other virtues such as love, hope and justice.</p>\n<p>It is hard to do justice to the scope and depth of McCloskey\u2019s book in a few short summary paragraphs. Our assessment is that her critique of \u2018Prudence only\u2019 as the basis for much thinking about market economies and societies is largely correct. She is right to draw attention to the presence of other virtues that motivate people in their economic activities, and which also serve to temper the tendency to excess of a focus solely on production and consumption. But she does not, in our view, demonstrate conclusively that the S virtues will emerge in the functioning of markets: that they are present is undeniable, but they could be nurtured elsewhere in a community or culture, and imported into market behaviours. Nor does she demonstrate that the market, motivated by prudence only (price, satisfaction, pleasure, utility) will not tend to destroy the S values as the self-destruction thesis asserts.</p>\n<h2>Reclaiming Virtue Ethics for Economics\u00a0</h2>\n<p>Bruni and Sugden (2013) note that economic analysis has been critiqued for its reliance on instrumental rationality (\u2018rational economic man\u2019) and on extrinsic motivations (such as pursuit of profit or utility). That analysis fails to understand that market transactions are human practices with their own values and intrinsic motivations. To address this richer understanding, the authors appeal to Macintyre\u2019s definition of a \u2018practice\u2019, defined as \u2018a coherent and complex form of socially established cooperative activity\u2019. They argue that markets are such a \u2018practice\u2019 which has its own intrinsic values and standards of excellence that enables the purposes of the activity to be pursued.</p>\n<h3>Uncovering the Telos of the Market</h3>\n<p>The first step is to uncover the telos of the market. The authors note that the fundamental purpose of markets is to facilitate mutually beneficial voluntary transactions. The building blocks of elementary economic analysis include the famous \u2018Edgeworth Box\u2019 diagram which illustrates the mutual gains from exchange between two persons, and the Ricardian gains from trade between nations arising from comparative advantage. Market participants understand that transactions bring mutual benefits to the transactors, and that this motivates their market behaviour. Implicit in actual market behaviour are values such as universality, enterprise, alertness, respect for other\u2019s preferences, trust, trustworthiness, acceptance of competition, self-help, and the stoical acceptance of outcomes.</p>\n<p>It is worth looking at some of these in more detail to understand the role they play in markets. <em>Universality</em> is the disposition to make mutually beneficial trades with others on terms of equality, without discrimination. <em>Trust </em>and trustworthiness come into play in the common situations where monitoring and enforcement of contracts or deals is difficult or prohibitively expensive. If you cannot trust the other party, then trade will not take place. Acceptance of <em>competition i</em>nvolves the realisation and acceptance that other parties are not obliged to enter trades with you if there are better offers from other traders in the market. <em>Self help</em> is the understanding that you can only realise gains from trade if you have something (a good or a service, or labour) to offer in exchange. <em>Acceptance of outcomes</em> is just that: some deals will work out well, and others less well. There is no basis for an attitude that presumes that a trader is entitled to a particular return just because they entered the market. Nor should a trader be envious if some others prosper more than they do. Uncertainty (and luck?) are pervasive in trading.</p>\n<p>Reflecting on our experience of markets, it is evident that a market economy would not function without these values; it is rather strange that they seldom feature in the teaching of elementary economics. The questions then are how these values can be turned into virtues exhibited by market actors, where \u2018virtues\u2019 are settled dispositions to act in accord with those values; and whether, as explored above, markets are supportive or undermining of those virtues.</p>\n<h3>Behavioural Economics and the Economics of Information</h3>\n<p>Behavioural economics and the economics of information have begun to address these issues. For example, there is an extensive literature in game theory about the emergence of trust: in principle, people can be cajoled into being trustworthy in situations where they are hoping to have a continuing presence in a market over time, and where information about deception or failure to fulfil promises is widely available to others in the market. [See Nowak and Highfield (2011) for a highly readable non-technical exposition.] Note, of course, that acting \u2018well\u2019 in such circumstances has nothing to do with virtue: it arises out of pure self-interest. There is also a literature that suggests that virtue is eroded where market incentives are introduced. The most quoted example is the Haifa creche. The creche had a problem with parents arriving late to pick up their offspring, so instituted fines for late collection. To their dismay the problem got worse. Parents interpreted the fine as a price for an additional service, for which they were willing to pay the fine. The introduction of the fine changed the mindset: previously arriving late was regarded as a failure to act appropriately towards the staff, but that was undermined. Sadly, when the fine was suspended, parents continued to arrive late in even greater numbers, because the virtue of being punctual and conscientious towards the creche staff had disappeared. The literature has moved towards accepting that market participants cannot always be relied on to behave virtuously, so the emphasis is on the development of mechanisms to reduce the impacts.</p>\n<p>It is unclear (at least to us!) whether Bruni and Sugden are going beyond a conclusion that without virtues relating to mutual benefits from cooperation in trades the market will not function effectively according to its telos, to an expectation that these virtues will arise from the experience of market activity as participants recognise that virtuous behaviour is necessary to sustain the markets over time. The problem is that introduction of extrinsic motivations such as monetary gains or profits can easily displace good behaviour: even if bad actors will eventually be identified, they may have been able to make sufficient short-term gains not to care about being exposed, as they can retire with their ill-gotten loot!</p>\n<h2>Good incentives are no substitute for good citizens.</h2>\n<p>In his 2016 book, <em>The Moral Economy: Why good incentives are no substitute for good citizens, </em>Samuel Bowles gives a comprehensive discussion of why the <em>doux commerce</em> thesis might not work in economies that emphasise incentives in the functioning of markets. He reviews evidence from \u2018laboratory\u2019 experiments which involve participants in playing games involving making economic decisions. The evidence is clear that offering a monetary incentive to participants based on their \u2018success\u2019 in the games, no matter how small the incentive, tends to crowd out altruism (he terms this \u2018categorical crowding out\u2019), and that the bigger the incentive offered, the larger the degree of crowding out (\u2018marginal crowding out\u2019).</p>\n<h3>Why Monetary Incentives Crowd out Virtues</h3>\n<p>He offers a range of suggestions for these findings. The first suggestion is that incentives provide information about the situational set up in the game, and so in some situations crowd out moral sentiments because it is appropriate not to be morally concerned: it is appropriate to be self-interested in the supermarket, but not within a family setting. The second suggestion is that incentives alter the process of learning to act morally, and so alters the weight given to altruism in the person\u2019s preferences. The third is that the offering of incentives is taken to provide information about the designer of the incentive, in particular the intended effect on the agent, and about the nature and purpose of the task to be performed: that information may be construed as playing down or even eliminating moral sentiments. The fourth suggestion is that incentives can lead to moral disengagement: if markets are believed to be places where agents act without moral consideration, then even a morally alert agent may act as if moral concerns are not relevant. Fifth, incentives may compromise agency: if the incentives give a self-interested reason for something that the agent would have done altruistically, then the agent may become cynical about their motives and allow it to undermine their sense of altruism. Finally, in his listing of suggestions, Bowles notes that incentives fire up the deliberative part of the brain, whereas the emotional part of the brain is more effective in prompting altruistic behaviour. Strong incentives may effectively silence those promptings.</p>\n<h3>Liberal Societies more often Display Civic Virtues in Markets</h3>\n<p>This analysis leaves a question about how it is that market-based cultures in the West do have cultural norms that support good citizens, and at the same time rely on markets for economic and social interactions. If the presence of market incentives undermines altruism (the \u2018self-destruction\u2019 thesis) then how does it come about that what is observed is closer to <em>doux commerce</em>? He explores this in a seminal paper (2011) which asks the question \u2018Is liberal society a parasite on tradition?\u2019. The paper reports studies that show unequivocally that market incentives crowd out moral motives. But it also presents convincing evidence from international comparisons of different societies that it is precisely the market based liberal societies that most exhibit civic virtues conducive to the functioning of markets. How can these contrasting pieces of evidence be reconciled?</p>\n<p>Bowles answer is that there is co-evolution between the development of market economies, and the rise of social institutions such as private property and the rule of law, which mutually support and strengthen each other. In this he finds support in the Enlightenment narratives put forward by secular humanists, that moral sentiments can thrive in social culture. His contention is that liberal institutions counteract and more than compensate for any \u2018parasitic\u2019 effect of markets on virtues. He dismisses the alternative argument that the development of markets grew out of the social cultures of traditional societies.</p>\n<h3>Religion and the Morality of Markets</h3>\n<p>Notably he does not address the much-contested sociological argument that there has been a historic link between Protestantism and the rise of market economies in the West, as famously proposed by the sociologist Max Weber in the <em>The Protestant Ethic and the Spirit of Capitalism </em>(English translation 1938), and meticulously explored by R H Tawney in <em>Religion and the Rise of Capitalism</em> (1926, 1938).<a class=\"anchor\" id=\"content100note1anc\" name=\"content100note1anc\">\u00a0</a><a class=\"note\" href=\"#content100note1sym\">[\u00a01\u00a0]</a> The proposition is that the Reformation values of work as a \u2018calling\u2019, avoidance of personal extravagance and waste, upholding the ideals of integrity, truthfulness and honesty in market dealings, and an obligation to care for the other parties to a transaction, all enabled markets to function effectively and prevented opportunistic behaviour.</p>\n<p>Fred Hirsch in his <em>Social Limits to Growth</em> (1977) also addressed the issue of the erosion of moral restraints in markets, and how that might be reversed. He is clear that a moral basis is needed if markets are not to be undermined by opportunistic behaviour on the part of participants. It can only operate successfully if there is general acceptance of standards of honesty, truth, trust, and absence of intimidation. While standards can be reinforced by a body of law, e.g. contract law, consumer protection, that is not sufficient in the absence of social consent. The entry of legal procedures into every contract would undermine the advantages of decentralised economic decision making, which is perceived to be the special genius of markets. Hirsch\u2019s thesis is that market capitalism originally succeeded because it had inherited a strong religious and moral framework, which served to prevent the pursuit of self-interest. However, with the erosion of religious sanctions, the market begins to operate less effectively for the reasons outlined in the \u2018self-destruction\u2019 thesis, and market behaviour begins to invade non-market areas. An interesting consequence is that without an ethic that sees the payment of taxes as a social responsibility, tax evasion and tax avoidance become the norm, and attract an even more complex structure of tax law to try to close the loopholes. Hirsch points to the decline of traditional Christian morality as the source of these problems, but has little to suggest how the situation might be rectified. At best he comments that a new social ethic is needed urgently, and optimistically asserts: \u2018The functional need for change in social ethic can be expected, over time, to promote it\u2019.</p>\n<p>In a provocative article (2011), Bowles outlines some evidence that markets crowd out virtues, but then attributes their overall success in western societies to the effect of also crowding out 'traditions'. What he means by traditions relates to the anthropological category of 'lineal-segmented societies'. These are societies based on related clusters of families who in the distant past exercised loyalty to the 'in' group and hostility to the 'out' group. \u00a0Bowles notes that advocates of traditional values/societies often idealize them, and do not notice their more destructive tendencies, typical of lineal-segmented societies, such as a lack of respect for outsiders, the rule of law, or inclusive social decision making. Thus, secularized societies may be impacted negatively by markets crowding out virtues, but the retreat of \u2018traditions\u2019 more than offsets this. His argument is in contradiction to the Weber thesis, because he does not distinguish between traditions which are akin to mafia clans (lineal-segmented societies), and traditions such as Protestantism which encourage commerce by treating 'in' and 'out' people equally as bearers of the image of God, and so are consistent with inclusion, trust and other market-friendly virtues.</p>\n<h2>The Serious Costs of Ignoring the Virtues in Economics</h2>\n<p>This brief review of the relevant literature suggests that the ignorance of most economists about the virtues is a serious shortcoming. There is sufficient evidence to show that the \u2018self-destruction\u2019 effect in market economies is likely to be widespread in economic behaviour, and that the more optimistic <em>doux commerce</em> effect is present, but is probably not robust unless sustained by a moral framework imported from outside the market.</p>\n<p>One solution is to seek to design market institutions and mechanisms to counter bad behaviour, so giving incentives to act well. A common response by the political authorities is to resort to law and regulation, seeking to counter damaging behaviours (such as corruption), or to constrain agents to behave in ways that are beneficial to all market participants. The danger is that regulation (and even more, legal constraints) will become a costly intervention which will undermine the market freedoms that underpin market capitalism. Moreover, as the experience of regulation amply demonstrates, the framing of rules can just give the regulated an incentive to seek ways around the rules, with costs both for the regulator and the regulated. The alternative is to seek ways of encouraging people to be \u2018good citizens\u2019 who care about the others with whom they are transacting in markets. The literature strongly suggests that historically it was external moral codes coming from religious cultures, such as the Reformation, that formed the emergence of \u2018good citizens\u2019. The optimism of some writers that secular moral codes can take the place of religious codes seems to us to be a triumph of optimism over a realistic assessment of the economic world in which humankind now lives.</p>\n<h2 class=\"new_page\">Endnotes</h2>\n<p class=\"endnote\"><a class=\"note\" href=\"#content100note1anc\">[\u00a01\u00a0]</a><a class=\"anchor\" id=\"content100note1sym\" name=\"content100note1sym\">\u00a0</a> See Whinster (2005/6) for an account of the related contributions of Weber and Tawney.</p>\n<h2 class=\"new_page\">References</h2>\n<p>Bowles S (2011), Is liberal society a parasite on tradition?

    "bodyText": "Does humanitarian work actually seek to achieve something morally worthwhile? One of Herdt\u2019s key points is that the virtues are essential to true human flourishing, by healing our inner conflicts, transforming our affections, equipping us to resist injustice, and directing us to work for institutions that themselves seek to support human flourishing in community. Thus, I take Herdt to be saying that cultivating the virtues enables us to both bring into being and carry out our substantive visions of the good.\n\nAt first blush, the work of humanitarianism (which I define as encompassing both emergency relief and ongoing development) ought to mount this hurdle easily. It is, after all, founded on an explicitly normative premise, that of the humanitarian impulse \u2013 the recognition that human suffering is morally bad, and that it is morally good therefore, to relieve it where possible. The most recent State of the Humanitarian System report estimates that international humanitarian (i.e. emergency relief-focused) assistance reached 106 million people around the world in 2021, to the tune of US$31.1 billion. Over 80% of that is government or institutionally funded, and almost half of that comes from five donors alone (the US, the EU, Germany, the UK, and Japan).\n\nRelief funding aims to alleviate the suffering of those in acute crisis, where their local or national governments are either overwhelmed or unwilling to respond. This includes setting up and managing refugee/displaced peoples camps, providing food, water, sanitation and hygiene services, and medical help, as well as specialised care for children, and coordination and protection efforts.\n\nThere are estimated to be around 5000 organisations with core emergency relief and protection goals, although the majority of relief funding goes to UN agencies such as the World Food Programme (WFP), the United Nations High Commissioner for Refugees (UNHCR), and the United Nations Children\u2019s Fund (UNICEF). [\u00a01\u00a0] UN agencies, the Red Cross and Crescent movements, and international NGOs (ideally) all work together in a cluster system when responding to disasters and conflicts, drawing on multiple sources of funding and backers.\n\nRelatedly, the broader development sector seeks to improve the wellbeing of people living in developing nations through sustained long-term improvement of social, economic, and political systems, as captured by the Sustainable Development Goals. Like emergency relief, development is mostly government or institutionally funded (around 80%), with the remainder flowing from private sources. Private development includes activities such as Compassion\u2019s child sponsorship program, while official development assistance (ODA) tends to focus on larger structural investments and capacity building. In 2022, the world\u2019s largest development donors, the governments of the OECD Development Assistance Committee (DAC) gave around US$204 billion in total aid flows (which includes loans and money spent in their own countries). [\u00a02\u00a0]\n\nIn reality, the boundaries between emergency and development aid funding and practice are fuzzy; for example, ODA figures capture both the emergency and development aid funding of OECD governments, and many NGOs utilise both private and official aid flows, for both emergency relief and development programming. All sorts of actors can and do engage in broadly humanitarian work, from multilateral organisations coordinating billions of dollars in funding from states down to small community groups and NGOs using private donations to mobilise ad hoc responses. Likewise, there is an increasingly vast array of activities that these actors are involved in, not just providing emergency medical and food supplies or setting up field hospitals and refugee camps, but also investing in education, financial literacy, small business holdings, or environmental projects such as tree planting and developing regenerative farming practices.\n\nThe contemporary humanitarian order draws upon centuries of broader traditions of altruism and compassion, and in no way has a monopoly on the ethics of care. However, as a modern phenomenon, what makes it distinctive is that it is a global system of care that desires to help others beyond borders of local duty; that in doing so, it seeks to express some kind of transcendental significance \u2013 to cultivate and express a sense of global solidarity and oneness; and that it is explicitly organised and a part of global governance (Barnett 2011). [\u00a03\u00a0]\n\nMany actors within the system, whether individuals, non-profits or states, commit themselves to some variation of the four fundamental principles of humanity, neutrality, impartiality, and independence, which are meant to safeguard the legitimacy of humanitarian activity as apolitical and based on need alone. This means its moral claims are distinctly universalist: that all human life is equal in worth, and that the task of saving it should not be swayed by race, place, or creed. However, a key point of disagreement within the humanitarian sector is between those who believe humanitarian work should restrict itself to emergency responses with a goal of merely reducing the load of human suffering versus those who advocate for more expansive engagement, including seeking to address causes of suffering such as poverty and conflict over the long term.\n\nGiven these diverging goals, is it possible to pinpoint a single substantive vision of human flourishing in the humanitarian sector? At one end of the spectrum is a very modest aim: simply to make the hell of human and natural disasters less hellish where possible. It is to keep body and soul together while crisis unfolds. This is ethos of organisations like the Red Cross. At the other end of the spectrum is a much more ambitious task: to transform those hells, if not into heaven, then at least into something capable of sustaining human wellbeing. An organisation like World Vision showcases this where it seeks to speak truth to power, foster strong communities, and link its emergency responses into its longer-term development programming. I think what unites these differing approaches is the underlying conviction that humans should not be left to suffer and die without hope. In this way, the humanitarian field at its best is an embodiment of the theological virtue of hope - hope in a future that is good, even if the present is not. It is also a concrete expression of the virtue of love \u2013 to will another\u2019s good and to act towards that end, without consideration of gains to the self.\n\nThis is the ideal of humanitarianism, although not always the reality. However, some critics do not feel that the humanitarian endeavour is actually even oriented to this ideal. For example, British sociologist Keith Tester (2010) worries that the UK\u2019s humanitarian commitments are primarily about helping the British public overcome \u2018colonial guilt\u2019; some have rejected the system altogether as an ideological weapon of the global North aimed at further dominating the political and economic structures of their former colonies (Chimni 2009). [\u00a04\u00a0] Others have acknowledged the moral worthiness of the humanitarian impulse, but wrestled with the extent to which relief and development activities can be co-opted for ill in difficult and violent situations (such as Anderson 1999). And anyone with exposure to government deliberations over foreign aid policy will be painfully aware of how much the discussion is guided by national interest rather than recipient wellbeing. Thus, perhaps a virtue ethics approach can help us ask hard questions about to what extent humanitarian action embodies its own stated ideals, by continually directing us to measure ourselves not just according to what is right or wrong, but by a more holistic vision of human flourishing that encompasses the wellbeing of all participants in the system.\n\nHow can the humanitarian system form and deform the character of the people involved in it? What virtues does it promote? What vices might it encourage? The normative nature of humanitarian work means that there are still distinct community expectations that humanitarian workers are \u2018in it for the right reasons\u2019, are not unduly motivated by financial gain or self-interest, and that their behaviour in-country is above reproach.\n\nThe strength of these norms can be seen by the outrage generated when they are publicly transgressed. In 2018, the NGO Oxfam underwent an enormous scandal when it was discovered that several of their staff deployed in Haiti had been using their position and their resources to host parties and hire prostitutes. [\u00a05\u00a0] The revelations prompted a crisis not just for Oxfam, but for the whole sector, precisely because it highlighted the gap between donors\u2019 expectations of behaviour, and the lived practices of (some) expatriate workers in the field. Whether their actions were legal or permissible was largely irrelevant; the central condemnation was that the buying of sexual services from the very women and girls the Oxfam staff were ostensibly there to help was not virtuous. It demonstrated clear inconsistency between the moral principle of responding to the dignity and value of those women and girls in seeking to aid them in their time of need, and the practice of objectifying them by exploiting that need in order to buy sex from them.\n\nThus, Herdt\u2019s comment that moral rules and principles require people who are actually capable of putting them into practice resonated with me as profoundly relevant to the issues that face relief and development workers. It is clear that it is not enough to know what is good; one must also act in a way consistent with that knowledge.\n\nBeyond this (and unlike in the Oxfam case), humanitarian workers often find themselves in ethically difficult scenarios, where discerning and carrying out morally virtuous action is genuinely fraught. For example, decision makers are regularly faced with questions about who to help first in a crisis, when to take sides on local issues, under what conditions to trade fairness for access, how to balance respect for autonomy with accountability to donors, how much to ask of their own workforce \u2013 physically, emotionally, and spiritually \u2013 as well as a myriad of other issues, all with their own dilemmas and trade-offs. Far too often humanitarian workers are faced with what must seem like choices between lesser evils, rather than the freedom to pursue pure goods. Thus, having, as Herdt defines it, a \u201cstable disposition that enables an agent to respond and act well\u201d seems to be an important part of surviving the moral weight of humanitarian work, and an incredibly crucial quality to cultivate in workers.\n\nI do wonder if professionalization of the relief and development field is a potential risk factor for losing sight of the importance of this kind of personal integrity of character. While good intentions do not cancel out harmful actions, perhaps virtue ethics can help to tease out the distinction between \u2018doing good\u2019 and \u2018doing good well\u2019, by acknowledging that the character formation of aid workers is a central part of the institutional responsibility of NGOs. The role of practical wisdom in helping to adjudicate ethically tricky situations I can see being particularly important to cultivate. For example, international NGO workers involved in rebuilding after 2004\u2019s Indian Ocean tsunami in Aceh, Indonesia, had to decide how best to address theft and adulteration of building supplies by the very people they were building for. Policies were all very well, but what workers really needed was the practical wisdom to understand the drivers of this behaviour and guide their engagement in solutions that led to community flourishing and peace, not just solving the immediate problem.\n\nThe explanation of spiritual disciplines such as repentance, self-examination, and prayer being key for cultivating virtue prompted me to reflect on how well the humanitarian sector is capable of such introspection, and how well it is able to truly learn from its own mistakes. The high turnover, fragmented and fast-paced nature of aid work directly challenges the capacity of individuals and organisations to honestly reflect on their impact, and I suspect ends up cultivating vices such as impatience, arrogance, and the over-emphasis of expertise. Perhaps Christian NGOs have an advantage here, but only where they are able to deliberately structure in opportunities for the exercise of spiritual disciplines for their staff.\n\nThe sector\u2019s current obsession with monitoring, evaluation and learning (often known as MEL or MEAL) strikes me as a symptom of this problem. It all too often acts as a justifier of further grants and funding, rather than a truly reflective process. Accurate data on needs, and accountability for resources spent are important goods to pursue, to be sure. But how does the system manage when the good being sought after is not easy to count? A high turnover environment with a tendency to short-term horizons combined with a major reliance on the goodwill of donors encourages humanitarians to be transactional and to focus mainly on outcomes that can be measured and quantified for donor reporting. In my own backyard, Australia\u2019s Pacific partners consistently complain that engaging with Australia\u2019s aid programming is a frustrating exercise in shallow relationships and short-term thinking, where their local knowledge is ignored, their needs are sidelined, and their priorities are dismissed. [\u00a06\u00a0]\n\nBuilding on this, I wonder how much the modern system, with its focus on funding, structure, and professional expertise, misses opportunities to encourage the formation of virtuous character in recipients as well as in aid workers, and donors. Herdt describes acting virtuously as \u201cfunctioning well as a human person, with desires, emotions, judgements, and projects harmonising with one another\u2026 to have the virtues is to be disposed to act well in relation to other individuals and to one\u2019s various communities\u201d.\n\nIn this sense, virtue ethics as explained here complements broader contemporary Christian teachings on the holistic nature of poverty, and the need to address more than the material elements of deprivation. For example, Corbett and Fikkert (2012), in their bestseller When Helping Hurts, outline a definition of poverty as primarily relational, and point to the need for poverty alleviation ministries to recognise and assist restoration of broken relationships with God, with self, with others in community, and with the environment. Herdt\u2019s comments on how the virtues are acquired are a needed corrective to the (all too popular) notion that education solves all wrongs. An organisation that teaches financial literacy to vulnerable women, for example, should not expect that this education alone will produce the character fruits of prudence or integrity. There must be opportunity for the participants to grasp for themselves what is good and wise and honest, and to desire to be the kind of person who is defined by such attributes.\n\nThe focus on truly holistic human flourishing in the virtue ethics thus might provide a practical set of tools for thinking about empowerment of both the humanitarian worker and the poor through orientation to the good in character and relationships, not merely in transactions focused on material goods or reducing exposure to danger. The virtuous humanitarian worker is one who relates rightly to those they participate with in the work of pursuing good. Their measures of success are not just the numbers of babies rehydrated or wells dug, but the mutual building up of equals in dignity and worth through the world they seek to bring into being together.\n\nMight a focus on character actually harm the vulnerable? I can see how, if not correctly applied, this approach may further entrench already existing moral problems in the sector. A focus on the virtues is intrinsically self-centred; that is, it centres on the self as the moral agent, and the kind of habits and dispositions that create the virtuous self in relation to others. This leaves a virtue ethics approach towards humanitarianism vulnerable to being hijacked by a view of aid as a consumer product for the benefit of the \u2018ethical consumer\u2019, for both donors and workers in the field. It does not begin with the distant vulnerable, but with me, and the habits and actions I should be taking. This all too easily leads to an ethics of aid as consumption, where I can buy or work my way to virtue; those in need of help are reduced to being objects of my charity. This is the mindset rightly criticised in the \u2018white saviour\u2019 complex, where working for a humanitarian agency or donating to an appeal is primarily framed as showcasing the extent to which the donor or worker is a good person.\n\nMy sense is that truly ethical humanitarianism must begin with those who suffer, with their need, and their preciousness in the sight of God. Insofar as much as we are thinking about ourselves at all, it should only be to recognise our duties towards the vulnerable as fellow children of the Creator, and as our neighbour who is in need. And so, a part of me is uneasy about investing time and attention on the donor and aid worker, rather than the human being made in God\u2019s image who suffers because of the world\u2019s brokenness and who needs restoration. I am also wary of assuming that the giver is in any better of a position.\n\nFrom a more structural perspective, this also ties into broader questions about the purpose of both relief and development aid. Are they disinterested charity, expressions of goodwill between those who otherwise have little claim on one another? Or are they about justice? As the human rights agenda has become a larger part of the language of aid work, the question of whether we should be motivated by merely moral responsibility (I should help because I can) or causal responsibility (I should help because it\u2019s my fault), has become more central. [\u00a07\u00a0] If humanitarianism is primarily an altruistic activity, the moral character and motivations of those who fund and staff it are arguably centrally important in preserving the purity of that altruism.\n\nHowever, if we accept the argument that wealthy developed nations and their populations have a duty to address the inequalities caused by their past (and perhaps present) wrongs, then the entire humanitarian project is cast in a different moral light. It becomes about reparations, and what kinds of moral claims the exploited have on the powerful. From this framing, it may be unhelpful to start by thinking about the virtues as an aspect of individual moral disposition; if the moral assumptions of the entire endeavour are off-kilter, then it can never be virtuous to participate. In this way, there are unresolved questions about whether or not humanitarianism is about the pursuit of justice, and if it is, what kind.\n\nThe power of a consequences-based approach is that it forces us to ask if our actions are actually making the difference we want them to make. The power of deontological approaches (i.e. rooted in an objective standard of right and wrong) is in their fierce safeguarding of the dignity and worth of the otherwise inconsequential. As I reflect on the virtues, I think it is natural to ask, what is the power of thinking about humanitarianism in terms of expressing virtue rather than primarily in terms of moral rights and wrongs or actions and their consequences? There are no easy answers to the questions I have raised here. However, I entitled this reflection virtue ethics versus virtue signalling because that is what is at stake when considering the moral realities of humanitarianism. Humanitarianism runs on faith, and it is built on hope, but it is meaningless without love. Without the overarching virtue of love to bind giver and receiver, all of the relief and development work in the world is mere virtue signalling, \u2018a resounding gong or a clanging cymbal\u2019. This, I think, is the ultimate power of virtues talk for this field \u2013 to make visible how love must ground all that we do.\n\nAnderson, Mary (1999) Do No Harm: How Aid Can Support Peace - Or War London: Lynne Rienner Publishers.

For example, British sociologist Keith Tester (2010) worries that the UK\u2019s humanitarian commitments are primarily about helping the British public overcome \u2018colonial guilt\u2019; some have rejected the system altogether as an ideological weapon of the global North aimed at further dominating the political and economic structures of their former colonies (Chimni 2009).<a class=\"anchor\" id=\"content100note4anc\" name=\"content100note4anc\">\u00a0</a><a class=\"note\" href=\"#content100note4sym\">[\u00a04\u00a0]</a> Others have acknowledged the moral worthiness of the humanitarian impulse, but wrestled with the extent to which relief and development activities can be co-opted for ill in difficult and violent situations (such as Anderson 1999). And anyone with exposure to government deliberations over foreign aid policy will be painfully aware of how much the discussion is guided by national interest rather than recipient wellbeing. Thus, perhaps a virtue ethics approach can help us ask hard questions about to what extent humanitarian action embodies its own stated ideals, by continually directing us to measure ourselves not just according to what is right or wrong, but by a more holistic vision of human flourishing that encompasses the wellbeing of all participants in the system.</p>\n<h2>The People: What Virtues or Vices does the Humanitarian System Promote?</h2>\n<p>How can the humanitarian system form and deform the character of the people involved in it? What virtues does it promote? What vices might it encourage? The normative nature of humanitarian work means that there are still distinct community expectations that humanitarian workers are \u2018in it for the right reasons\u2019, are not unduly motivated by financial gain or self-interest, and that their behaviour in-country is above reproach.</p>\n<h3>Transgressing Virtues</h3>\n<p>The strength of these norms can be seen by the outrage generated when they are publicly transgressed. In 2018, the NGO Oxfam underwent an enormous scandal when it was discovered that several of their staff deployed in Haiti had been using their position and their resources to host parties and hire prostitutes.<a class=\"anchor\" id=\"content100note5anc\" name=\"content100note5anc\">\u00a0</a><a class=\"note\" href=\"#content100note5sym\">[\u00a05\u00a0]</a> The revelations prompted a crisis not just for Oxfam, but for the whole sector, precisely because it highlighted the gap between donors\u2019 expectations of behaviour, and the lived practices of (some) expatriate workers in the field. Whether their actions were legal or permissible was largely irrelevant; the central condemnation was that the buying of sexual services from the very women and girls the Oxfam staff were ostensibly there to help was not <em>virtuous. </em>It demonstrated clear inconsistency between the moral principle of responding to the dignity and value of those women and girls in seeking to aid them in their time of need, and the practice of objectifying them by exploiting that need in order to buy sex from them.</p>\n<p>Thus, Herdt\u2019s comment that moral rules and principles require people who are actually capable of putting them into practice resonated with me as profoundly relevant to the issues that face relief and development workers. It is clear that it is not enough to know what is good; one must also act in a way consistent with that knowledge.</p>\n<h3>Virtues in Fraught Situations</h3>\n<p>Beyond this (and unlike in the Oxfam case), humanitarian workers often find themselves in ethically difficult scenarios, where discerning and carrying out morally virtuous action is genuinely fraught. For example, decision makers are regularly faced with questions about who to help first in a crisis, when to take sides on local issues, under what conditions to trade fairness for access, how to balance respect for autonomy with accountability to donors, how much to ask of their own workforce \u2013 physically, emotionally, and spiritually \u2013 as well as a myriad of other issues, all with their own dilemmas and trade-offs. Far too often humanitarian workers are faced with what must seem like choices between lesser evils, rather than the freedom to pursue pure goods. Thus, having, as Herdt defines it, a \u201cstable disposition that enables an agent to respond and act well\u201d seems to be an important part of surviving the moral weight of humanitarian work, and an incredibly crucial quality to cultivate in workers.</p>\n<h3>The Ambiguities of Professionalization\u00a0</h3>\n<p>I do wonder if professionalization of the relief and development field is a potential risk factor for losing sight of the importance of this kind of personal integrity of character. While good intentions do not cancel out harmful actions, perhaps virtue ethics can help to tease out the distinction between \u2018doing good\u2019 and \u2018doing good well\u2019, by acknowledging that the character formation of aid workers is a central part of the institutional responsibility of NGOs. The role of practical wisdom in helping to adjudicate ethically tricky situations I can see being particularly important to cultivate. For example, international NGO workers involved in rebuilding after 2004\u2019s Indian Ocean tsunami in Aceh, Indonesia, had to decide how best to address theft and adulteration of building supplies by the very people they were building for. Policies were all very well, but what workers really needed was the practical wisdom to understand the drivers of this behaviour and guide their engagement in solutions that led to community flourishing and peace, not just solving the immediate problem.</p>\n<p>The explanation of spiritual disciplines such as repentance, self-examination, and prayer being key for cultivating virtue prompted me to reflect on how well the humanitarian sector is capable of such introspection, and how well it is able to truly learn from its own mistakes. The high turnover, fragmented and fast-paced nature of aid work directly challenges the capacity of individuals and organisations to honestly reflect on their impact, and I suspect ends up cultivating vices such as impatience, arrogance, and the over-emphasis of expertise. Perhaps Christian NGOs have an advantage here, but only where they are able to deliberately structure in opportunities for the exercise of spiritual disciplines for their staff.</p>\n<p>The sector\u2019s current obsession with monitoring, evaluation and learning (often known as MEL or MEAL) strikes me as a symptom of this problem. It all too often acts as a justifier of further grants and funding, rather than a truly reflective process. Accurate data on needs, and accountability for resources spent are important goods to pursue, to be sure. But how does the system manage when the good being sought after is not easy to count? A high turnover environment with a tendency to short-term horizons combined with a major reliance on the goodwill of donors encourages humanitarians to be transactional and to focus mainly on outcomes that can be measured and quantified for donor reporting. In my own backyard, Australia\u2019s Pacific partners consistently complain that engaging with Australia\u2019s aid programming is a frustrating exercise in shallow relationships and short-term thinking, where their local knowledge is ignored, their needs are sidelined, and their priorities are dismissed.<a class=\"anchor\" id=\"content100note6anc\" name=\"content100note6anc\">\u00a0</a><a class=\"note\" href=\"#content100note6sym\">[\u00a06\u00a0]</a></p>\n<h3>Missed Opportunities for Character Development</h3>\n<p>Building on this, I wonder how much the modern system, with its focus on funding, structure, and professional expertise, misses opportunities to encourage the formation of virtuous character in recipients as well as in aid workers, and donors. Herdt describes acting virtuously as \u201cfunctioning well as a human person, with desires, emotions, judgements, and projects harmonising with one another\u2026 to have the virtues is to be disposed to act well in relation to other individuals and to one\u2019s various communities\u201d.</p>\n<p>In this sense, virtue ethics as explained here complements broader contemporary Christian teachings on the holistic nature of poverty, and the need to address more than the material elements of deprivation. For example, Corbett and Fikkert (2012), in their bestseller <em>When Helping Hurts, </em>outline a definition of poverty as primarily relational, and point to the need for poverty alleviation ministries to recognise and assist restoration of broken relationships with God, with self, with others in community, and with the environment. Herdt\u2019s comments on how the virtues are acquired are a needed corrective to the (all too popular) notion that education solves all wrongs. An organisation that teaches financial literacy to vulnerable women, for example, should not expect that this education alone will produce the character fruits of prudence or integrity. There must be opportunity for the participants to grasp for themselves what is good and wise and honest, and to desire to be the kind of person who is defined by such attributes.</p>\n<p>The focus on truly holistic human flourishing in the virtue ethics thus might provide a practical set of tools for thinking about empowerment of both the humanitarian worker and the poor through orientation to the good in character and relationships, not merely in transactions focused on material goods or reducing exposure to danger. The virtuous humanitarian worker is one who relates rightly to those they participate with in the work of pursuing good. Their measures of success are not just the numbers of babies rehydrated or wells dug, but the mutual building up of equals in dignity and worth through the world they seek to bring into being together.</p>\n<h2>Qualms: Can a Focus on Virtues be Harmful?</h2>\n<p>Might a focus on character actually harm the vulnerable? I can see how, if not correctly applied, this approach may further entrench already existing moral problems in the sector. A focus on the virtues is intrinsically self-centred; that is, it centres on the self as the moral agent, and the kind of habits and dispositions that create the virtuous self in relation to others. This leaves a virtue ethics approach towards humanitarianism vulnerable to being hijacked by a view of aid as a consumer product for the benefit of the \u2018ethical consumer\u2019, for both donors and workers in the field. It does not begin with the distant vulnerable, but with me, and the habits and actions I should be taking. This all too easily leads to an ethics of aid as consumption, where I can buy or work my way to virtue; those in need of help are reduced to being objects of my charity. This is the mindset rightly criticised in the \u2018white saviour\u2019 complex, where working for a humanitarian agency or donating to an appeal is primarily framed as showcasing the extent to which the donor or worker is a good person.</p>\n<h3>Beginning with the Vulnerable\u00a0</h3>\n<p>My sense is that truly ethical humanitarianism must begin with those who suffer, with their need, and their preciousness in the sight of God. Insofar as much as we are thinking about ourselves at all, it should only be to recognise our duties towards the vulnerable as fellow children of the Creator, and as our neighbour who is in need. And so, a part of me is uneasy about investing time and attention on the donor and aid worker, rather than the human being made in God\u2019s image who suffers because of the world\u2019s brokenness and who needs restoration. I am also wary of assuming that the giver is in any better of a position.</p>\n<h3>Moral Responsibility versus Causal Responsibility</h3>\n<p>From a more structural perspective, this also ties into broader questions about the purpose of both relief and development aid. Are they disinterested charity, expressions of goodwill between those who otherwise have little claim on one another? Or are they about justice? As the human rights agenda has become a larger part of the language of aid work, the question of whether we should be motivated by merely moral responsibility (I should help because I can) or causal responsibility (I should help because it\u2019s my fault), has become more central.<a class=\"anchor\" id=\"content100note7anc\" name=\"content100note7anc\">\u00a0</a><a class=\"note\" href=\"#content100note7sym\">[\u00a07\u00a0]</a> If humanitarianism is primarily an altruistic activity, the moral character and motivations of those who fund and staff it are arguably centrally important in preserving the purity of that altruism.</p>\n<p>However, if we accept the argument that wealthy developed nations and their populations have a duty to address the inequalities caused by their past (and perhaps present) wrongs, then the entire humanitarian project is cast in a different moral light. It becomes about reparations, and what kinds of moral claims the exploited have on the powerful. From this framing, it may be unhelpful to start by thinking about the virtues as an aspect of individual moral disposition; if the moral assumptions of the entire endeavour are off-kilter, then it can never be virtuous to participate. In this way, there are unresolved questions about whether or not humanitarianism is about the pursuit of justice, and if it is, what kind.</p>\n<h2>Faith, Hope <em>and</em> Love in Humanitarianism?</h2>\n<p>The power of a consequences-based approach is that it forces us to ask if our actions are actually making the difference we want them to make. The power of deontological approaches (i.e. rooted in an objective standard of right and wrong) is in their fierce safeguarding of the dignity and worth of the otherwise inconsequential. As I reflect on the virtues, I think it is natural to ask, what is the power of thinking about humanitarianism in terms of expressing virtue rather than primarily in terms of moral rights and wrongs or actions and their consequences? There are no easy answers to the questions I have raised here. However, I entitled this reflection virtue ethics versus virtue signalling because that is what is at stake when considering the moral realities of humanitarianism. Humanitarianism runs on faith, and it is built on hope, but it is meaningless without love. Without the overarching virtue of love to bind giver and receiver, all of the relief and development work in the world is mere virtue signalling, \u2018a resounding gong or a clanging cymbal\u2019. This, I think, is the ultimate power of virtues talk for this field \u2013 to make visible how love must ground all that we do.</p>\n<h2 class=\"new_page\">References and Further Reading</h2>\n<p>Anderson, Mary (1999) <em>Do No Harm: How Aid Can Support Peace - Or War</em> London: Lynne Rienner Publishers.

I\u2019ll touch briefly on the first two topics (the ecclesial and the interreligious), and camp slightly longer on the third (the social).\n\nI\u2019ll begin with a comment on an ecclesial issue raised by Prof. Herdt\u2019s essay. I appreciated that, in Prof. Herdt\u2019s discussion of how virtues are developed, she emphasizes the role of communities\n\nthat lift up exemplars, pass down inspiring narratives of life lived well amidst circumstances both supportive and challenging, and offer both bracing truth-telling and a sense of belonging within which it becomes possible to face up to our own deep flaws and reaffirm our commitment to develop finer-grained moral discernment and more whole-hearted devotion to the good. (p. 4)\n\nQuite right. To build on that, I might add that believers and theologians from cultural contexts different to one\u2019s own can accelerate that process of virtue formation, by shedding light on one\u2019s own cultural blind spots. For example, traditional values in many sub-Saharan African tribal communities expose much of the West's preoccupation with productivity as thinly veiled avarice; similarly, Latin American communities\u2019 tendencies towards collectivism can sensitize us to the ways when individualism devolves into egoism. So, much as the Global Faculty Initiative is careful to curate insights from scholars worldwide, universities and seminaries concerned to cultivate the virtues should likewise be seeking the witness of global believers, whose biographies and theologies can help grind out culturally engrained vices.\n\nMoving to a second area of Scholar Leader\u2019s work\u2014interreligious relations, especially with Muslims\u2014my attention was caught by Prof. Herdt\u2019s discussion of the difference between pagan and Christian virtues (p. 9). She invoked Augustine\u2019s belief that \u201cpagan pursuit of virtue was a pursuit of glory and honor for the self\u201d whereas \u201cChristian virtues were grounded in humble acceptance of grace and oriented to God, not self.\u201d While not denying the degrees of virtue on display amongst pagans, their failure to acknowledge God entails that their virtues are never properly oriented towards the right ultimate end. \u201cPagan virtue could thus be seen as oriented to a good proximate or penultimate end, even if not \u2026 to God as ultimate end\u201d (p. 9).\n\nI agree that virtue is most properly itself when it is oriented towards God. But how does this construal of virtue apply to the members of the Jewish or Muslim faiths, whose piety is oriented towards God (even if Christianity differs in profound ways from Judaism and Islam in our Trinitarian understanding of God). Given the theocentricity of Judaism and Islam, would Prof. Herdt consider Muslims and Jews to be disadvantaged in the acquisition or orientation of the virtues? Or, alternatively, might there be ways in which Christian cultivation of virtue can be quickened or chastened by aspects of Jewish and Muslim practice (perhaps the diligence of Jewish Sabbath observance, or the temperance of Islamic fasting)?\n\nThe third and final area of Prof. Herdt\u2019s essay that intrigued me was the discussion of virtues in society (particularly, in institutions and universities). It caught my attention because SL is coordinating a new initiative called No More , which seeks to confront sexual misconduct in global seminaries (and by extension, in churches), in order to make seminaries safer and holier places, especially for women. As Prof. Herdt explored the ways that institutions can cultivate virtues and vices, and as she gestured towards some of the moral and immoral tendencies especially susceptible to propagation in the university, I wondered how to zero in on the virtues that are most germane to the topics of sexual harassment, abuse, and rectitude. Courage to tell the truth, honesty, and justice all came to mind, especially as pertains to supporting victims and dealing with perpetrators; all too often cowardice in the face of power or social pressure leads to silence, and thereby to complicity. Prudence to navigate complex cases and the occasional questionable accusation would be key; precisely because we must heed the general admonitions to \u201cbelieve women\u201d and to decry victim-blaming, great wisdom and intentionality must be applied to adjudicate potential instances of false accusations. Temperance against lust surely is relevant, as is the cultivation of holy love, for without these the sorts of affections appropriate to the believing community can devolve into perversions that shatter Christian communion. Since No More focuses specifically on the idiosyncratic sort of institute of higher education that is a seminary, surely these virtues can be foregrounded in our efforts.\n\nI also asked myself how different cultural characteristics (as per my first point in this note) might conduce to or impede efforts to confront sexual misconduct in seminaries. Since SL is a global fellowship, the No More project is comprised of scholars from around the globe. This enables us to resource one another with the cultural and traditional strengths of our respective regions. That said, I do not mean to indicate that one culture is more virtuous than another. The characteristics of a given culture often have both virtuous and vicious underpinnings. Consider the North Atlantic emphases on freedom and the control of women over their bodies. These cultural emphases are substantially rooted in virtues such as justice and/or protection for the vulnerable, but they are at least susceptible to distortion by egotism or libertinism. Or one might think of modesty\u2014a strong value in the MENA region\u2014as pertinent to the topic of sexual misconduct, but is Middle Eastern modesty an expression of temperance or of the unjust repression of women? To select a final example: chastity is a prominent value in many African cultures, and surely chastity and self-control are virtues lacking in men who exceed the limits of appropriate sexual conduct\u2026but attention to chastity and purity is also cited as a cause for female genital mutilation in a variety of African nations. So, it is perhaps less simple than it might appear at first glance to invoke diverse cultural perspectives as resources for stimulating the acquisition of virtue in global communities.\n\nIn this light, we must ask how different cultural and religious contexts can feed our understanding and cultivation of virtue, and how we might filter out any vicious underpinnings of a given cultural tendency. What guidance can we obtain for promoting virtue and confronting vice in global education (especially global theological education), without falling into the opposite traps of colonialism and relativism? Finally, how can we creatively imagine the ways that the No More project could cultivate the virtues relevant to diminishing sexual abuse and harassment in seminaries, both in the West and around the world? This latter question, in a different register, applies forcefully to research universities wherever they are found.\n\nBoon, Mike. The African Way: The Power of Interactive Leadership .

Courage to tell the truth, honesty, and justice all came to mind, especially as pertains to supporting victims and dealing with perpetrators; all too often cowardice in the face of power or social pressure leads to silence, and thereby to complicity. Prudence to navigate complex cases and the occasional questionable accusation would be key; precisely because we must heed the general admonitions to \u201cbelieve women\u201d and to decry victim-blaming, great wisdom and intentionality must be applied to adjudicate potential instances of false accusations. Temperance against lust surely is relevant, as is the cultivation of holy love, for without these the sorts of affections appropriate to the believing community can devolve into perversions that shatter Christian communion. Since <em>No More </em>focuses specifically on the idiosyncratic sort of institute of higher education that is a seminary, surely these virtues can be foregrounded in our efforts.</p>\n<p>I also asked myself how different cultural characteristics (as per my first point in this note) might conduce to or impede efforts to confront sexual misconduct in seminaries. Since SL is a global fellowship, the <em>No More </em>project is comprised of scholars from around the globe. This enables us to resource one another with the cultural and traditional strengths of our respective regions. That said, I do not mean to indicate that one culture is more virtuous than another. The characteristics of a given culture often have both virtuous and vicious underpinnings. Consider the North Atlantic emphases on freedom and the control of women over their bodies. These cultural emphases are substantially rooted in virtues such as justice and/or protection for the vulnerable, but they are at least susceptible to distortion by egotism or libertinism. Or one might think of modesty\u2014a strong value in the MENA region\u2014as pertinent to the topic of sexual misconduct, but is Middle Eastern modesty an expression of temperance or of the unjust repression of women? To select a final example: chastity is a prominent value in many African cultures, and surely chastity and self-control are virtues lacking in men who exceed the limits of appropriate sexual conduct\u2026but attention to chastity and purity is also cited as a cause for female genital mutilation in a variety of African nations. So, it is perhaps less simple than it might appear at first glance to invoke diverse cultural perspectives as resources for stimulating the acquisition of virtue in global communities.</p>\n<h2>Future Challenges and Persistent Questions</h2>\n<p>In this light, we must ask how different cultural and religious contexts can feed our understanding and cultivation of virtue, and how we might filter out any vicious underpinnings of a given cultural tendency. What guidance can we obtain for promoting virtue and confronting vice in global education (especially global theological education), without falling into the opposite traps of colonialism and relativism? Finally, how can we creatively imagine the ways that the <em>No More </em>project could cultivate the virtues relevant to diminishing sexual abuse and harassment in seminaries, both in the West and around the world? This latter question, in a different register, applies forcefully to research universities wherever they are found.</p>\n<h2 class=\"new_page\">Further Reading</h2>\n<p>Boon, Mike. <em>The African Way: The Power of Interactive Leadership</em>.

What use could a theory of moral character be to those who see it as their task to live in faithful obedience from moment to moment? Their thinking will be deliberative, spelled out in moral rules and principles, prima facie obligations and perfect duties, roles and situations, anticipated consequences, and so on. These categories mark the main road to practical resolution; reflection on character seems more like a scenic drive for tourists. An ethics that told of nothing but virtues and vices could never focus the field of moral vision upon a definite action, never identify practical challenges lying near to hand or convert evaluations into decisions. The doubt is reasonable, but it should not have the last word.\n\nThe New Testament contains much talk of obedience, temptation, resolve and decision, but there are also lists of virtues (though not so named), and occasionally of vices. When we read that the fruit of the Spirit is love, joy, peace, longsuffering ..... etc., that is not an escape from the challenge of decision, but a way of framing it: \u201cIf we live by the Spirit, let us walk by the Spirit!\u201d (Gal. 5:22-25.) Deliberative trains of thought depend on good moral descriptions, which must take in not only the field of action and its possibilities, but \u201cthe agent\u201d, bringing specific responsibilities and resources to the action. By \u201cthe agent\u201d we mean simply the subject of a given action. We need not make up our mind at once as to what kinds of thing can, and what cannot, be said to possess \u201cagency\u201d, but since \u201caction\u201d in the full sense requires a commitment of intention, an agent must at least be capable of understanding not only its field of action but itself, too. An agent can tell you what he, she, it or they are doing.\n\nIt is the special contribution of virtue-theory, then, to make us concious of our own agency, not simply as a point of view on the field of action but as a factor we must understand in approaching it. It describes for us the different forms that the success or failure of our agency may take. Different forms require a theory that keeps the plurality of virtues in view, for when \u201cvirtue\u201d is spoken of only in the singular, it usually means that the full range of moral responses has been collapsed into just one kind of response, the only one that matters to the speaker, as when warrior-cultures speak of \u201cvirtue\u201d to mean simply military courage. The possibility of failure, as well as success, demands that an account of virtues must be an account of vices, too.\n\nVirtue-descriptions, in the first place, teach us what and how we may admire. People acting and living well are the primary object of moral appreciation and satisfaction. When we talk about virtues, we disengage ourselves from our own preoccupations with acting and seek to \u201cdistinguish what is excellent\u201d as seen us in the lives of others. We notice not only how acts shape situations, but also how they shape enduring dispositions in their agents, when considerately decided on and consistently persisted in, so that a moral person emerges before our eyes as a whole, sustained over time. A good act excites our admiration; a good person attracts our love, and so enriches our moral resources.\n\nBut can we do more with virtues than admire them? Can we make them an object of decision , too ? Apparently, we can. As we appreciate virtues, we may resolve to imitate them. Policies we form for our lives may be patterned on the lives of others. What kind of a decision is involved in this? The classical world liked to recound the moral fable of the young Herakles, confronted at a crossroads by the ladies Virtue and Vice who challenged him to make a decisive, once-and-for-all choice between them. Barth characterised this fable as \u201ca pagan image for a pagan thing\u201d, and we can understand his unease. For though Christians, too, believe in a decisive act of moral self-determination, represented in baptism, they are likely to be wary of characterising it as a \u201cchoice\u201d, for choices are between commensurable objects. Virtue and vice are not commensurable; the bad life is not an alternative to the good life. Yet there may still be a decision; wholly freely, and yet wholly dependent on divine grace, we may make the life-committing decision of baptism. And in consequence there can be many further decisions that have in view not merely our immediate acts, but the direction of life as a whole. To take the simplest example, there may be a decision to recognise a vocation \u2013 to be a scholar, a physician, or a musician. Our moral concerns are not limited to what we shall do next, but include what we shall become. We may pray, taking the broadest view of our lives, \u201cLet me not wander from thy commandments!\u201d And where we may pray, there we may deliberate.\n\nWhich is not to say that the moral shape of our future lives is simply placed in our hands to decide once and for all. These broad, self-orienting decisions are not \u201csettled\u201d, as what we are to do next may be settled. They need implementation and confirmation in consequent decisions of practical detail. And perhaps they need modification, for we sometimes cannot, and sometimes should not, stick to everything that we have planned for ourselves, even with the highest ideals. Other decisions arise, and cannot be refused. Urgent decisions that affect others\u2019 welfare may make consideration of our own moral character seem impertinent. The scholar can be forced into administrative leadership; the sympathetic pastor can need to do something that hurts someone. Even Socrates had to accept political office, and Plantaganet Palliser (in Trollope\u2019s novel) had to refuse it for his wife\u2019s sake. Such departures from conscious moral goals are not breaches of moral law or principle, though we may be ashamed of them. We may feel guilty about the book we never wrote or the student we had to suspend, and may suspect ourselves of having missed our opportunity. But that is not necessarily the right explanation. Sometimes ideals formed by admiration of a worthy object and admirable in themselves may still not be the right guide to the circumstances in which God has placed us.\n\nWhat virtue-theory has to tell us, then, is not the whole of Ethics, but is something important. It tells us that we are formed as continuous moral agents by the correspondence of our dispositions and our acts: what we have become is what we do, and what we do is what we shall become. This correspondence is not merely posited in logic by defining \u201cact\u201d and \u201cdisposition\u201d in terms of one another. It is a law of human growth and development, something observed and proved in experience.\n\nYet there are liminal cases where this law seems to be suspended. Consider the life that acquires moral worth on the basis of a single act performed at a decisive moment: in the Gospels, the dying thief; in fiction, Sidney Carton in Dickens\u2019 A Tale of Two Cities , the rake who redeems his useless life by taking another man\u2019s place on the guillotine. Here, by a miracle of grace, a single act of perfect recognition or decision defines the moral person for eternity. Consider the opposite case, that of the hollowed-out hypocrite, whose acts are not morally determinative at all, but conceal an inner character of a very different kind: the Pharisees in the Gospels, and in Dickens\u2019 Martin Chuzzlewit Mr. Pecksniff. Perhaps neither type exists in life in its pure form; perhaps the law of correspondence is only qualified, never entirely suspended. But these types, abstract though they are, warn us of the conceptual limits of virtue theory: the correspondence between disposition and acts may be a complex one; the good and evil of character may not be simply accountable in terms of what becomes second nature. Our acts may transcend what we have become; they may also conceal it.\n\nBut one apparent suspension of the correspondence is of perpetual interest: is not politics a sphere in which we must always be content to evaluate acts in ignorance of the dispositions that produced them? I know a friend\u2019s gift is well meant, however ill-chosen, because I know the disposition of my friend; I do not know that a politician\u2019s gift is well meant, however well-chosen, because I do not know the disposition of the politician. I must be content with what I know. Augustine once observed that a piece of legislation passed by a prince in return for a bribe may still be a just law, however unjust the act. That paradox may be quite difficult to come to terms with, which may be the reason why we constantly project caricatures of political actors and their motives, of which in fact we know very little. If it is the truth of public life that it is, as we call it, a \u201csystem\u201d, in which the morality of public actors is opaque and the outcomes, good or ill, may be what nobody intended, it is a truth that runs counter to our instinctive need to belong to our community morally.\n\nOne way of evading the cliff-edge of political cynicism to which this seems to lead us, a way congenial to Augustine himself, is to think of political acts and institutions as a kind of moral form, still waiting to be filled with the substance of motivation and commitment. Let us agree that the real moral character of a community is a matter of inner dispositions that cannot be clearly seen, an ultimate love of self or love of God. Yet what is projected on the screen of public life may still be morallly good or evil to the extent that it affords opportunities for good or evil intentions on the part of those act within its terms. We may understand in this way the apostle\u2019s guarded but perfectly serious remark that \u201cthe law is good, if it is used lawfully\u201d (1 Tim. 1:8). Some institutions and practices may be of service and support to men and women whose hope is to act well and to cooperate in good actions with others. We might echo the apostle: education is good, if we use it educationally; medicine is good if we use it healthily, and so on. The good of these institutions is not a categorical good; it remains on the social surface, where it can be used to evil as well as good. Yet we may find them supportive of virtuous life and practice, a worthy object of good intentions and an essential condition for further good undertakings. Others may be hindrances to them.\n\nIn this way we can recognise that there are corporate agents and corporate acts with their own kinds of moral perspicuity. Even the state, though from one angle it is simply a \u201csystem\u201d, a set of processes for producing decisions that no human being can or would take, has a function that can support our good intentions, if we have them. A state can have something like good intentions itself: there is, after all, such a thing as \u201cpolicy\u201d, which stands in the same relation to political acts as an intention does to personal acts. Non-state institutions, such as churches, voluntary associations, sports clubs and businesses, are formed as means for pursuing specified goods of action: leisure activities, the purchase of material goods, communications in worship, art or learning, and so on.\n\nWe refer intelligibly, then, to the \u201cvirtues\u201d of institutions, for though this use of the term is an analogy, it is a perfectly valid one. Institutions resemble human agents in embodying a consciousness of some good and a purpose of realising it. They conform to laws of action that enable them to realise it more effectively. We debate the \u201cvirtues\u201d of different educational systems, of ways of regulating the circulation of money, of practices in the use of medical treatments, referring precisely to their disposition to perform well. We expect institutions to operate, as closely as possible, by laws calculated to realise their end. When institutions set themselves the task of pursuing other goods than their own, the confusion that may result, as in one or two notorious culture-war scenarios, can be comic. We don\u2019t want banks to act as political censors, even if we believe in political censorship; we don\u2019t want heritage organisations to condemn historical actors to banishment from public memory, even if we think some historical actors deserved a condemnation they never received. Yet that does not mean that institutions should never be conscious of goods other than their own specific objects. The virtues of those who work in the institution, at least, cannot be confined to the narrow performances of institutional excellence. Financial advisors must have numeracy and business acumen, but we also expect them to distinguish worthy from unworthy investment opportunities. Teachers must be scholars to whatever level is appropriate for them, but we are unhappy with teachers who see only the marks and don\u2019t see their pupils. An institution may have a special good to contribute to society \u2013 education, health, circulation of money, heritage preservation or whatever \u2013 but to offer it effectively it must be hospitable, at least, to some perfectly general virtues of social interaction - banks need tellers who can be helpful to customers, schools need teachers who can sympathise with the problems of failing students. The interaction between virtues of institutions and virtues of individuals who serve them has a prominent role in Jennifer Herdt\u2019s account.\n\nAnd here we may be tempted to draw a line too clearly: may we say that the special virtue belongs to the institution, the general virtues to those who work in it? No, because the institution must at least allow and encourage the expression of those individual virtues in those who work for it. And when we have said that much, we have indicated a general virtue we expect of all institutions: that of allowing their staff to work in ways consistent with their best moral aspirations. Call it, if you will, being a considerate employer. And there may be other such general virtues that we expect of instutions in dealing with the public that has business with them. We cannot pursue these possibilities further. The point remains simply that in institutions, as in individuals, virtues do not come singly, but accompany and reinforce one another.\n\nAnd with this train of thought one of the oldest questions in virtue-theory has crept up on us: how may we think of the virtues as concretely unified in the agent ? Plato remarked that someone who had courage but no prudence, didn\u2019t actually have courage at all, but only the vice of rashness. To have one virtue, he suggests, one must have all. That is a daunting proposition. Virtues are goods of activity, and there are many of them. They must have some distributive economy, since human virtue is not a matter of being like God, doing everything well, but a particular pattern of doing some things well. Yet we would hesitate to call someone \u201cvirtuous\u201d who did only one kind of thing well, who was efficient, let us say, but had no other recommendation? A virtuous person has a certain scope, can move convincingly from one moral demand to the next. Perhaps we may allow that the \u201cgreat character with great flaws\u201d \u2013 the wisely compassionate artist or statesman, say, who neglects his family - can be a figure of virtue. But Plato was surely right that even such one-sided greatness must be composed of more than one excellent quality. Can we say anything about how one virtue accompanies another?\n\nVirtue is a disposition to act well, and actions are conceived in unique deliberative situations where we are looking for the one \u201cright\u201d thing to do. Only the observer, who does not have to act, is at liberty to think there could be more than one right thing to do. If the notion of a virtue depends on the notion of a good act, and that in turn depends on its \u201crightness\u201d for the situation, we may attribute special importance to the virtue, if there is one, of discerning situations and their practical demands \u201cPrudence\u201d was the standard name for that virtue, and Thomas, among others, regards it as occupying a distinct position in relation to the others, since it is always needed to act well.\n\nBut there are other ways of identifying certain virtues as focal . When the New Testament Epistles indicate the qualities that should mark the life of faith, they place them in lists, each list different from the next. Exploring the sequence of the virtues is a heuristic exercise, following no single binding order, and yet it is clear that the lists are not shapeless: \u201clove\u201d is mentioned at the beginning or end of a list, never in the middle. And in the Pauline writings we find a list of three \u201cmeta-virtues\u201d, shaped by salvation-history, which formed a canon for all other exercises of special practical powers: faith, attending to the fact of Christ, hope to the promise of his return and love to the presence of the believing community. These, and especially love, must accompany all special virtues of action and performance, Paul tells us, because they \u201clast\u201d, giving enduring continuity to the moral agent throughout life and into eternity. Plato, for his part, had proposed a list of four focal virtues, based on his theory of the powers of the soul: continence, fortitude, wisdom and justice, virtues of appetite, of energy, of thought and, supremely, of the balance to be established among them. These two lists, Christian and pagan, were not usually seen as incompatible.\n\nThere is another traditional way of organising virtues, to which Jennifer Herdt devotes some attention, arriving at a conclusion that I think subtly departs from Thomas. The distinction between intellectual and moral virtues was framed by Aristotle to focus the distinction between our reflective and spontaneous self-direction, a distinction that developed over the centuries and takes a distinctively modern form in the early-modern doctrine of two powers of the mind: \u201cthe power to begin or forbear\u201d and \u201cthe power of perception\u201d (Locke). For Herdt the power of perception is subordinate to the power to begin or forbear; the intellectual virtue is really just a \u201cskill\u201d, because \u201cabsent the moral virtues, one can make bad use of an intellectual virtue\u201d. True, but I am inclined to think that one can make bad use of any virtue, intellectual or moral, if it is not properly ordered to other virtues and supremely to faith, hope and love.\n\nWe have in the Gospels a striking parable from Jesus about an \u201cintellectual virtue\u201d. A rich man ripped off by his manager warns him that he is going to be fired, with the result that he is ripped off once again as the manager exploits his last days in control to buy himself a few friends to aid him in his unemployment. The master, we are told, \u201ccommended the dishonest steward\u201d, and what he is commended for is precisely prudence, from Aristotle\u2019s list of intellectual virtues and specially highlighted by Thomas. Jesus explains what the manager got right: he knew what money was good for, which is, friendship . Manifestly, this manager made a bad use of his prudence, and yet the capacity to deliberate intelligently, taking the true measure of realities and possibilities, is something no form of virtue can do without.\n\nPrecisely because the virtues are not unconscious stable dispositions to do well, but reflected stable dispositions to do well, emerging not only from our spontaneous wills but from our understandings of the good, there are things we must know if we are to act well. Some of the things we need to know are purely contingent, and it would seem to be a matter of moral indifference whether we happen to know them or not, in which case ignorance is, in Hume\u2019s verdict, \u201cmore to be lamented than judged of\u201d. But suppose someone did not know that a child should make every effort to be present at a parent\u2019s deathbed? Is that ignorance unfortunate, or blameable? Not knowing something of that kind is an ignorance of what the parent-child relationship really is, and so, in a profound sense, of what, or who, we ourselves are. And there are other moral truths that it seems we are simply required to know. Has not the advocate for euthanasia, firmly convinced that a life of persistent suffering or deprived of intelligent self-control is a life unfit to be maintained, embraced a morally faulty belief?\n\nAnd so we shall need to look for the ordering of virtues in a grace that is not itself simply one of the virtues \u2013 a grace that allows our various dispositions and powers to come together to serve God\u2019s purposes effectively. Which is why some of the Greek Fathers were reluctant to allow that love, the \u201cbond of perfection\u201d among the virtues, was itself a virtue, seeing it, rather, as an operation of the Holy Spirit. Virtues are necessary, but not sufficient. Therefore we pray, Lead us not into temptation \u2013 \u201ctemptation\u201d being precisely the moral challenge for which no acquired virtue can fully prepare us.\n\nThe classical texts referred to are Plato\u2019s Republic, book 4, and Aristotle\u2019s Nicomachean Ethics book 2. There are many good translations of both available; I use F.M. Cornford\u2019s Plato (Oxford 1941, 1970) and Terence Irwin\u2019s Aristotle (Indianapolis, Hackett 1999). An indication of the patristic use of this tradition is Augustine\u2019s early work, De moribus ecclesiae catholicae, which appears in a volume of the New City Press complete Augustine called The Manichean Debate , translated by R.J. Teske as \u201cThe Catholic Way of Life\u201d (New York, 2006). Thomas\u2019s great treatise on virtue is in Summa Theologiae II-1.49-67. There are many translations, but those who can will use the Blackfriars edition (London: Eyre & Spottiswoode 1964-80, now reissued by Cambridge University Press), volumes 22 & 23. A fine Protestant text from the eighteenth century is Jonathan Edwards\u2019 \u201cDissertation on the Nature of True Virtue\u201d, in vol. 8 of the Yale University Press edition of the Works ( Ethical Writings, ed. Paul Ramsey, 1989). Twentieth-century claims for virtue as a new foundation for ethics are represented at their strongest in Alasdair McIntyre\u2019s After Virtue (University of Notre Dame Press 1981.) Robert M. Adams A Theory of Virtue (Oxford University Press 2006) must stand as a discerning contribution to a huge philosophical literature. Among theologians appropriating the theme Stanley Hauerwas got in early with Character in the Christian Life (Trinity University Press 1975, later University of Notre Dame Press) which signalled a direction for himself and others. For a lighter handling from the standpoint of the New Testament see N.T. Wright\u2019s Virtue Reborn (London, SPCK 2010) . I have developed my own view of the topic in chapters 5&6 of Self World and Time, and chapter 4 of Finding and Seeking (Eerdmans, 2013-14); see also my article \u201cPride\u2019s Progress\u201d ( Studies in Christian Ethics, 2015, 59-69).",

When we talk about virtues, we disengage ourselves from our own preoccupations with acting and seek to \u201cdistinguish what is excellent\u201d as seen us in the lives of others. We notice not only how acts shape situations, but also how they shape enduring dispositions in their agents, when considerately decided on and consistently persisted in, so that a moral person emerges before our eyes as a whole, sustained over time. A good act excites our admiration; a good person attracts our love, and so enriches our moral resources.</p>\n<h3>Virtue Decisions</h3>\n<p>But can we do more with virtues than admire them? Can we make them an object of decision<em>, </em>too<em>? </em>Apparently, we can. As we appreciate virtues, we may resolve to imitate them. Policies we form for our lives may be patterned on the lives of others. What kind of a decision is involved in this? The classical world liked to recound the moral fable of the young Herakles, confronted at a crossroads by the ladies Virtue and Vice who challenged him to make a decisive, once-and-for-all choice between them. Barth characterised this fable as \u201ca pagan image for a pagan thing\u201d, and we can understand his unease. For though Christians, too, believe in a decisive act of moral self-determination, represented in baptism, they are likely to be wary of characterising it as a \u201cchoice\u201d, for choices are between commensurable objects. Virtue and vice are not commensurable; the bad life is not an <em>alternative</em> to the good life. Yet there may still be a decision; wholly freely, and yet wholly dependent on divine grace, we may make the life-committing decision of baptism. And in consequence there can be many further decisions that have in view not merely our immediate acts, but the direction of life as a whole. To take the simplest example, there may be a decision to recognise a vocation \u2013 to be a scholar, a physician, or a musician. Our moral concerns are not limited to <em>what we shall do next, </em>but include <em>what we shall become. </em>We may pray, taking the broadest view of our lives, \u201cLet me not wander from thy commandments!\u201d And where we may pray, there we may deliberate.</p>\n<h3>Chains of Decisions</h3>\n<p>Which is not to say that the moral shape of our future lives is simply placed in our hands to decide once and for all. These broad, self-orienting decisions are not \u201csettled\u201d, as what we are to do next may be settled. They need implementation and confirmation in consequent decisions of practical detail. And perhaps they need modification, for we sometimes cannot, and sometimes should not, stick to everything that we have planned for ourselves, even with the highest ideals. Other decisions arise, and cannot be refused. Urgent decisions that affect others\u2019 welfare may make consideration of our own moral character seem impertinent. The scholar can be forced into administrative leadership; the sympathetic pastor can need to do something that hurts someone. Even Socrates had to accept political office, and Plantaganet Palliser (in Trollope\u2019s novel) had to refuse it for his wife\u2019s sake. Such departures from conscious moral goals are not breaches of moral law or principle, though we may be ashamed of them. We may feel guilty about the book we never wrote or the student we had to suspend, and may suspect ourselves of having missed our opportunity. But that is not necessarily the right explanation. Sometimes ideals formed by admiration of a worthy object and admirable in themselves may still not be the right guide to the circumstances in which God has placed us.</p>\n<h2>The Correspondence of Dispositions and Acts</h2>\n<p>What virtue-theory has to tell us, then, is not the whole of Ethics, but is something important. It tells us that we are formed as continuous moral agents by the correspondence of our dispositions and our acts: what we have become is what we do, and what we do is what we shall become. This correspondence is not merely posited in logic by defining \u201cact\u201d and \u201cdisposition\u201d in terms of one another. It is a law of human growth and development, something observed and proved in experience.</p>\n<p>Yet there are liminal cases where this law seems to be suspended. Consider the life that acquires moral worth on the basis of a single act performed at a decisive moment: in the Gospels, the dying thief; in fiction, Sidney Carton in Dickens\u2019 <em>A Tale of Two Cities</em>, the rake who redeems his useless life by taking another man\u2019s place on the guillotine. Here, by a miracle of grace, a single act of perfect recognition or decision defines the moral person for eternity. Consider the opposite case, that of the hollowed-out hypocrite, whose acts are not morally determinative at all, but conceal an inner character of a very different kind: the Pharisees in the Gospels, and in Dickens\u2019 <em>Martin Chuzzlewit </em>Mr. Pecksniff. Perhaps neither type exists in life in its pure form; perhaps the law of correspondence is only qualified, never entirely suspended. But these types, abstract though they are, warn us of the conceptual limits of virtue theory: the correspondence between disposition and acts may be a complex one; the good and evil of character may not be simply accountable in terms of what becomes second nature. Our acts may transcend what we have become; they may also conceal it.</p>\n<p>But one apparent suspension of the correspondence is of perpetual interest: is not <em>politics</em> a sphere in which we must always be content to evaluate acts in ignorance of the dispositions that produced them? I know a friend\u2019s gift is well meant, however ill-chosen, because I know the disposition of my friend; I do not know that a politician\u2019s gift is well meant, however well-chosen, because I do not know the disposition of the politician. I must be content with what I know. Augustine once observed that a piece of legislation passed by a prince in return for a bribe may still be a <em>just law, </em>however unjust the <em>act.</em> That paradox may be quite difficult to come to terms with, which may be the reason why we constantly project caricatures of political actors and their motives, of which in fact we know very little. If it is the truth of public life that it is, as we call it, a \u201csystem\u201d, in which the morality of public actors is opaque and the outcomes, good or ill, may be what nobody intended, it is a truth that runs counter to our instinctive need to belong to our community morally.</p>\n<h2>Virtues of Political and Corporate Institutions?</h2>\n<p>One way of evading the cliff-edge of political cynicism to which this seems to lead us, a way congenial to Augustine himself, is to think of political acts and institutions as a kind of moral <em>form, </em>still waiting to be filled with the <em>substance </em>of motivation and commitment. Let us agree that the real moral character of a community is a matter of inner dispositions that cannot be clearly seen, an ultimate love of self or love of God. Yet what is projected on the screen of public life may still be morallly good or evil to the extent that it affords opportunities<em> </em>for<em> </em>good or evil intentions on the part of those act within its terms. We may understand in this way the apostle\u2019s guarded but perfectly serious remark that \u201cthe law is good, if it is used lawfully\u201d (1 Tim. 1:8). Some institutions and practices may be of service and support to men and women whose hope is to act well and to cooperate in good actions with others. We might echo the apostle: education is good, if we use it educationally; medicine is good if we use it healthily, and so on. The good of these institutions is not a categorical good; it remains on the social surface, where it can be used to evil as well as good. Yet we may find them supportive of virtuous life and practice, a worthy object of good intentions and an essential condition for further good undertakings. Others may be hindrances to them.</p>\n<p>In this way we can recognise that there are corporate agents and corporate acts with their own kinds of moral perspicuity. Even the state, though from one angle it is simply a \u201csystem\u201d, a set of processes for producing decisions that no human being can or would take, has a function that can support our good intentions, if we have them. A state can have something like good intentions itself: there is, after all, such a thing as \u201cpolicy\u201d, which stands in the same relation to political acts as an intention does to personal acts. Non-state institutions, such as churches, voluntary associations, sports clubs and businesses, are formed as means for pursuing specified goods of action: leisure activities, the purchase of material goods, communications in worship, art or learning, and so on.</p>\n<p>We refer intelligibly, then, to the \u201cvirtues\u201d of institutions, for though this use of the term is an analogy, it is a perfectly valid one. Institutions resemble human agents in embodying a consciousness of some good and a purpose of realising it. They conform to laws of action that enable them to realise it more effectively. We debate the \u201cvirtues\u201d of different educational systems, of ways of regulating the circulation of money, of practices in the use of medical treatments, referring precisely to their disposition to perform well. We expect institutions to operate, as closely as possible, by laws calculated to realise their end. When institutions set themselves the task of pursuing other goods than their own, the confusion that may result, as in one or two notorious culture-war scenarios, can be comic. We don\u2019t want banks to act as political censors, even if we believe in political censorship; we don\u2019t want heritage organisations to condemn historical actors to banishment from public memory, even if we think some historical actors deserved a condemnation they never received. Yet that does not mean that institutions should never be conscious of goods other than their own specific objects. The virtues of those who work in the institution, at least, cannot be confined to the narrow performances of institutional excellence. Financial advisors must have numeracy and business acumen, but we also expect them to distinguish worthy from unworthy investment opportunities. Teachers must be scholars to whatever level is appropriate for them, but we are unhappy with teachers who see only the marks and don\u2019t see their pupils. An institution may have a special good to contribute to society \u2013 education, health, circulation of money, heritage preservation or whatever \u2013 but to offer it effectively it must be hospitable, at least, to some perfectly general virtues of social interaction - banks need tellers who can be helpful to customers, schools need teachers who can sympathise with the problems of failing students. The interaction between virtues of institutions and virtues of individuals who serve them has a prominent role in Jennifer Herdt\u2019s account.</p>\n<p>And here we may be tempted to draw a line too clearly: may we say that the <em>special </em>virtue belongs to the institution, the <em>general </em>virtues to those who work in it? No, because the institution must at least allow and encourage the expression of those individual virtues in those who work for it. And when we have said that much, we have indicated a general virtue we expect of all institutions: that of allowing their staff to work in ways consistent with their best moral aspirations. Call it, if you will, being a considerate employer. And there may be other such general virtues that we expect of instutions in dealing with the public that has business with them. We cannot pursue these possibilities further. The point remains simply that in institutions, as in individuals, virtues do not come singly, but accompany and reinforce one another.</p>\n<h2>How Are Virtues Unified?</h2>\n<p>And with this train of thought one of the oldest questions in virtue-theory has crept up on us: how may we think of the virtues as concretely unified in the agent<em>? </em>Plato remarked that someone who had courage but no prudence, didn\u2019t actually have courage at all, but only the vice of rashness. To have one virtue, he suggests, one must have all. That is a daunting proposition. Virtues are goods of activity, and there are many of them. They must have some distributive economy, since human virtue is not a matter of being like God, doing everything well, but a particular pattern of doing some things well. Yet we would hesitate to call someone \u201cvirtuous\u201d who did only one kind of thing well, who was efficient, let us say, but had no other recommendation? A virtuous person has a certain scope, can move convincingly from one moral demand to the next. Perhaps we may allow that the \u201cgreat character with great flaws\u201d \u2013 the wisely compassionate artist or statesman, say, who neglects his family - can be a figure of virtue. But Plato was surely right that even such one-sided greatness must be composed of <em>more than one </em>excellent quality. Can we say anything about how one virtue accompanies another?</p>\n<p>Virtue is a disposition to act well, and actions are conceived in unique deliberative situations where we are looking for the one \u201cright\u201d thing to do. Only the observer, who does not have to act, is at liberty to think there could be more than one right thing to do. If the notion of a virtue depends on the notion of a good act, and that in turn depends on its \u201crightness\u201d for the situation, we may attribute special importance to the virtue, if there is one, of discerning situations and their practical demands \u201cPrudence\u201d was the standard name for that virtue, and Thomas, among others, regards it as occupying a distinct position in relation to the others, since it is always needed to act well.</p>\n<h3>Focal Virtues</h3>\n<p>But there are other ways of identifying certain virtues as focal . When the New Testament Epistles indicate the qualities that should mark the life of faith, they place them in lists, each list different from the next. Exploring the sequence of the virtues is a heuristic exercise, following no single binding order, and yet it is clear that the lists are not shapeless: \u201clove\u201d is mentioned at the beginning or end of a list, never in the middle. And in the Pauline writings we find a list of three \u201cmeta-virtues\u201d, shaped by salvation-history, which formed a canon for all other exercises of special practical powers: faith, attending to the fact of Christ, hope to the promise of his return and love to the presence of the believing community. These, and especially love, must accompany all special virtues of action and performance, Paul tells us, because they \u201clast\u201d, giving enduring continuity to the moral agent throughout life and into eternity. Plato, for his part, had proposed a list of four focal virtues, based on his theory of the powers of the soul: continence, fortitude, wisdom and justice, virtues of appetite, of energy, of thought and, supremely, of the balance to be established among them. These two lists, Christian and pagan, were not usually seen as incompatible.</p>\n<h2>Are Intellectual Virtues more than Skills?</h2>\n<p>There is another traditional way of organising virtues, to which Jennifer Herdt devotes some attention, arriving at a conclusion that I think subtly departs from Thomas. The distinction between <em>intellectual </em>and <em>moral </em>virtues was framed by Aristotle to focus the distinction between our reflective and spontaneous self-direction, a distinction that developed over the centuries and takes a distinctively modern form in the early-modern doctrine of two powers of the mind: \u201cthe power to begin or forbear\u201d and \u201cthe power of perception\u201d (Locke). For Herdt the power of perception is subordinate to the power to begin or forbear; the intellectual virtue is really just a \u201cskill\u201d, because \u201cabsent the moral virtues, one can make bad use of an intellectual virtue\u201d. True, but I am inclined to think that one can make bad use of <em>any</em> virtue, intellectual or moral, if it is not properly ordered to other virtues and supremely to faith, hope and love.</p>\n<p>We have in the Gospels a striking parable from Jesus about an \u201cintellectual virtue\u201d. A rich man ripped off by his manager warns him that he is going to be fired, with the result that he is ripped off once again as the manager exploits his last days in control to buy himself a few friends to aid him in his unemployment. The master, we are told, \u201ccommended the dishonest steward\u201d, and what he is commended for is precisely <em>prudence, </em>from Aristotle\u2019s list of intellectual virtues and specially highlighted by Thomas. Jesus explains what the manager got right: he <em>knew what money was good for, </em>which is, friendship<em>. </em>Manifestly, this manager made a bad use of his prudence, and yet the capacity to deliberate intelligently, taking the true measure of realities and possibilities, is something no form of virtue can do without.</p>\n<p>Precisely because the virtues are not <em>unconscious </em>stable dispositions to do well, but <em>reflected </em>stable dispositions to do well, emerging not only from our spontaneous wills but from our understandings of the good, there are things we must know if we are to act well. Some of the things we need to know are purely contingent, and it would seem to be a matter of moral indifference whether we happen to know them or not, in which case ignorance is, in Hume\u2019s verdict, \u201cmore to be lamented than judged of\u201d. But suppose someone did not know that a child should make every effort to be present at a parent\u2019s deathbed? Is that ignorance unfortunate, or blameable? Not knowing something of that kind is an ignorance of what the parent-child relationship really <em>is, </em>and so, in a profound sense, of what, or who, we ourselves are. And there are other moral truths that it seems we are simply required to know. Has not the advocate for euthanasia, firmly convinced that a life of persistent suffering or deprived of intelligent self-control is a life unfit to be maintained, embraced a morally faulty belief?</p>\n<h2>Grace: Virtues are Necessary but not Sufficient</h2>\n<p>And so we shall need to look for the ordering of virtues in a grace that is not itself simply one of the virtues \u2013 a grace that allows our various dispositions and powers to come together to serve God\u2019s purposes effectively. Which is why some of the Greek Fathers were reluctant to allow that love, the \u201cbond of perfection\u201d among the virtues, was itself a virtue, seeing it, rather, as an operation of the Holy Spirit. Virtues are necessary, but not sufficient. Therefore we pray, <em>Lead us not into temptation \u2013 </em>\u201ctemptation\u201d being precisely the moral challenge for which no acquired virtue can fully prepare us.</p>\n<h2 class=\"new_page\">Further Reading</h2>\n<p>The classical texts referred to are Plato\u2019s <em>Republic, </em>book 4, and Aristotle\u2019s <em>Nicomachean Ethics </em>book 2. There are many good translations of both available; I use F.M. Cornford\u2019s Plato (Oxford 1941, 1970) and Terence Irwin\u2019s Aristotle (Indianapolis, Hackett 1999). An indication of the patristic use of this tradition is Augustine\u2019s early work, <em>De moribus ecclesiae catholicae, </em>which appears in a volume of the New City Press complete Augustine called <em>The Manichean Debate</em>, translated by R.J. Teske as \u201cThe Catholic Way of Life\u201d (New York, 2006). Thomas\u2019s great treatise on virtue is in <em>Summa Theologiae </em>II-1.49-67. There are many translations, but those who can will use the Blackfriars edition (London: Eyre &amp; Spottiswoode 1964-80, now reissued by Cambridge University Press), volumes 22 &amp; 23. A fine Protestant text from the eighteenth century is Jonathan Edwards\u2019 \u201cDissertation on the Nature of True Virtue\u201d, in vol. 8 of the Yale University Press edition of the <em>Works </em>(<em>Ethical Writings, </em>ed. Paul Ramsey, 1989). Twentieth-century claims for virtue as a new foundation for ethics are represented at their strongest in Alasdair McIntyre\u2019s <em>After Virtue </em>(University of Notre Dame Press 1981.)<em> </em>Robert M. Adams <em>A Theory of Virtue </em>(Oxford University Press 2006) must stand as a discerning contribution to a huge philosophical literature. Among theologians appropriating the theme Stanley Hauerwas got in early with <em>Character in the Christian Life </em>(Trinity University Press 1975, later University of Notre Dame Press) which signalled a direction for himself and others. For a lighter handling from the standpoint of the New Testament see N.T. Wright\u2019s <em>Virtue Reborn </em>(London, SPCK 2010)<em>. </em>I have developed my own view of the topic in chapters 5&amp;6 of <em>Self World and Time, </em>and chapter 4 of <em>Finding and Seeking </em>(Eerdmans, 2013-14); see also my article \u201cPride\u2019s Progress\u201d (<em>Studies in Christian Ethics, </em>2015, 59-69).</p>"

    "bodyText": "Disciplinary Note\n\nThese comments expose a limitation of economics, and financial economics more specifically, where human or corporate behaviour is usually modelled by mathematical models. Typical models comprise two elements: (i) an objective or goal, for example, to satisfy a personal utility such as increased consumption, or to meet production goals in a business firm; and (ii) a constraint, for example, to keep within my personal budget, or to meet a minimum rate of profit. These mathematical models, which are intended to optimize given objectives, are fundamentally instrumental. Everything is about reaching the set objective. Even where the agents (\u2018me\u2019 or my \u2018firm\u2019) of these models extend to groups such as families, corporations, institutions or social planners, all act instrumentally within the structure of the typical economic model. The goals and limitations of the people or firms in the model must be fully described by the components of the model.\n\nConventional economic models are useful for description and prediction. They explain incentives, predict a range of behaviours and often expose unintended consequences of regulation and policy, with remarkable clarity. For example, models of increases in taxation of income can show how much some groups of workers might reduce the hours they work when getting a lower after-tax hourly wage, limiting total tax collections.\n\nThe instrumental methods of economics help us understand, pragmatically, incentives in a world of both common grace and human sinfulness. These models are capable of capturing self-interest (utility) and altruism (utility that include the interests of others) without making prior judgments about the morality (or virtue) of the objectives.\n\nAlthough less conventionally constrained objectives, such as \u2018altruism\u2019 (where I gain utility by making charitable donations), social cohesion (where I value how others in a group feel) or ESG goals (where a firm cares about pollution or slavery), marginally change objective functions in these models, they nevertheless fail to grasp the transcendence of virtue on humans and their communities. Thus, these very features of economics mean its models fail as normative guides.\n\nTake the principle of maximising shareholder value, a lynchpin of corporate finance. According to this principle, the prime goal of managers in a firm is to increase the value of shares held by investors. This theory proposes a strict set of unrealistic assumptions that markets will efficiently allocate resources, and individuals and firms do not influence prices, so that the interests of shareholders and society in general coincide. In other words, what is good for the shareholders is good for the society.\n\nHowever, when used as a normative goal, without regard to market failures, let alone personal and institutional virtues, the outcomes of these models of maximizing shareholder value are predictable, yet sometimes destructive. It is true that the reduction of complex problems in varied social contexts to an instrumental prediction is convenient for teachers (and students) of \u2018Finance 101\u2019. It is also the case that this model conveniently offers an \u2018escape clause\u2019 for corporations\u2019 choices that neglect virtue and damage people, exploit the environment and degrade community and institutions. Even in recent decades we have witnessed the sub-prime crisis, the oxycodone epidemic, and the misconduct recorded by the Hayne Royal Commission into financial services in Australia. In such cases, shareholder value maximisation was used to justify vicious choices.\n\nAs researchers and teachers, we need to state the strengths of disciplinary models alongside their limitations. How are these limitations best presented to our students, colleagues and researchers from other disciplines?\n\nAt another point, Professor Herdt notes that \u2018human beings have both temperamental and acquired dispositions that do not count as virtues\u2019.\n\nOver the past few decades, economic researchers have made radical changes by incorporating personality traits and acquired skill into theory and empirical research. These advances have not been paralleled by similar attention to virtues. For example, in my own field of household finance, conventional approaches now build in human psychological tendencies, such as focusing on the present over the future, and cognitive challenges, such as forecasts involving exponential rather than linear growth (e.g., interest on the interest earned on bank deposits or the spread of infectious diseases).\n\nThese psychological traits and skill deficiencies would have been treated as irrelevant 20 years ago. Now they are used to support a variety of policy and regulatory interventions. For example, they influence policy options on automatic or mandatory participation in retirement savings plans in order to combat our bias towards focusing on the present (e.g., Butt et al. 2018). They also shape what are the duties of fiduciaries or advisors who otherwise might be tempted to steer na\u00efve clients towards strategies that lead to higher advisor commissions rather than better outcomes for clients (e.g., Agnew et al. 2018). Behavioural economics and finance have recognized that humans work with informational and cognitive limitations (e.g., Wu et al. 2015), and also that relevant skills can\u2019t be assumed, are variable in the cross-section and over time, and are not always worth acquiring.\n\nWhile personality traits and skill are increasingly standard features of models, the incorporation of virtue \u2013 as a driver of decision-making (e.g., does honesty lead me to return an over payment when there are no apparent consequences or \u2018utility\u2019 to not returning it), as a variable personal attribute (e.g., maintaining fair assessment by recognizing that some students will cheat in exams if the opportunity arises, while others will not) and as a dynamic process (e.g., where personal faithfulness is acquired over years of partnership in long-term professional relationships) \u2013 seems to have had much less traction. Some studies consider \u2018religion\u2019 in limited ways, such as the effect of religious values on readiness to repay debt on time, or the social connectedness gained through church attendance. However, people are not usually defined or modelled by their virtues.\n\nTo include virtue, such as mercy, in an optimization model is challenging: if mercy trumps everything, other trade-offs are irrelevant in the decision and the optimization becomes uninteresting. By contrast, some psychological traits can be modelled in trade-offs. For example, the human inclination to value the present over the future (the present bias) can be captured by adjusting mathematical representations of patience and built into otherwise conventional methods. Researchers are more likely to include human characteristics that standard approaches can manage.\n\nHousehold finance addresses all the financial decisions of life \u2013 both frequent day to day decisions like buying groceries, saving for the near and the long term, choosing insurance cover \u2013 and large and infrequent choices about education, home loans and retirement. These choices are profoundly influenced by the virtues of honesty (for example, truthfulness on loan applications and tax returns), faithfulness (for example, meeting my loan obligations, working and studying diligently) and self control (for example, staying within my budget).\n\nFor social scientists who take virtues seriously, the challenge is to admit the role of virtue and creatively to develop new approaches to a more complete model of behaviour.\n\nAgnew, J.

These models are capable of capturing self-interest (utility) and altruism (utility that include the interests of others) without making prior judgments about the morality (or virtue) of the objectives.</p>\n<h2>Limits of Economic Models as Normative Guides\u00a0</h2>\n<p>Although less conventionally constrained objectives, such as \u2018altruism\u2019 (where I gain utility by making charitable donations), social cohesion (where I value how others in a group feel) or ESG goals (where a firm cares about pollution or slavery), marginally change objective functions in these models, they nevertheless fail to grasp the <em>transcendence </em>of virtue on humans and their communities. Thus, these very features of economics mean its models fail as normative guides.</p>\n<p>Take the principle of maximising shareholder value, a lynchpin of corporate finance. According to this principle, the prime goal of managers in a firm is to increase the value of shares held by investors. This theory proposes a strict set of unrealistic assumptions that markets will efficiently allocate resources, and individuals and firms do not influence prices, so that the interests of shareholders and society in general coincide. In other words, what is good for the shareholders is good for the society.</p>\n<p>However, when used as a normative goal, without regard to market failures, let alone personal and institutional virtues, the outcomes of these models of maximizing shareholder value are predictable, yet sometimes destructive. It is true that the reduction of complex problems in varied social contexts to an instrumental prediction is convenient for teachers (and students) of \u2018Finance 101\u2019. It is also the case that this model conveniently offers an \u2018escape clause\u2019 for corporations\u2019 choices that neglect virtue and damage people, exploit the environment and degrade community and institutions. Even in recent decades we have witnessed the sub-prime crisis, the oxycodone epidemic, and the misconduct recorded by the Hayne Royal Commission into financial services in Australia. In such cases, shareholder value maximisation was used to justify vicious choices.</p>\n<p>As researchers and teachers, we need to state the strengths of disciplinary models alongside their limitations. How are these limitations best presented to our students, colleagues and researchers from other disciplines?</p>\n<h2>Behavioral Economics\u00a0</h2>\n<p>At another point, Professor Herdt notes that \u2018human beings have both temperamental and acquired dispositions that do not count as virtues\u2019.</p>\n<p>Over the past few decades, economic researchers have made radical changes by incorporating personality traits and acquired skill into theory and empirical research. These advances have not been paralleled by similar attention to virtues. For example, in my own field of household finance, conventional approaches now build in human psychological tendencies, such as focusing on the present over the future, and cognitive challenges, such as forecasts involving exponential rather than linear growth (e.g., interest on the interest earned on bank deposits or the spread of infectious diseases).</p>\n<p>These psychological traits and skill deficiencies would have been treated as irrelevant 20 years ago. Now they are used to support a variety of policy and regulatory interventions. For example, they influence policy options on automatic or mandatory participation in retirement savings plans in order to combat our bias towards focusing on the present (e.g., Butt et al. 2018). They also shape what are the duties of fiduciaries or advisors who otherwise might be tempted to steer na\u00efve clients towards strategies that lead to higher advisor commissions rather than better outcomes for clients (e.g., Agnew et al. 2018). Behavioural economics and finance have recognized that humans work with informational and cognitive limitations (e.g., Wu et al. 2015), and also that relevant skills can\u2019t be assumed, are variable in the cross-section and over time, and are not always worth acquiring.</p>\n<h2>Incorporating Virtues in Household Finance\u00a0</h2>\n<p>While personality traits and skill are increasingly standard features of models, the incorporation of virtue \u2013 as a driver of decision-making (e.g., does honesty lead me to return an over payment when there are no apparent consequences or \u2018utility\u2019 to not returning it), as a variable personal attribute (e.g., maintaining fair assessment by recognizing that some students will cheat in exams if the opportunity arises, while others will not) and as a dynamic process (e.g., where personal faithfulness is acquired over years of partnership in long-term professional relationships) \u2013 seems to have had much less traction. Some studies consider \u2018religion\u2019 in limited ways, such as the effect of religious values on readiness to repay debt on time, or the social connectedness gained through church attendance. However, people are not usually defined or modelled by their virtues.</p>\n<p>To include virtue, such as mercy, in an optimization model is challenging: if mercy trumps everything, other trade-offs are irrelevant in the decision and the optimization becomes uninteresting. By contrast, some psychological traits can be modelled in trade-offs. For example, the human inclination to value the present over the future (the present bias) can be captured by adjusting mathematical representations of patience and built into otherwise conventional methods. Researchers are more likely to include human characteristics that standard approaches can manage.</p>\n<p>Household finance addresses all the financial decisions of life \u2013 both frequent day to day decisions like buying groceries, saving for the near and the long term, choosing insurance cover \u2013 and large and infrequent choices about education, home loans and retirement. These choices are profoundly influenced by the virtues of <em>honesty </em>(for example, truthfulness on loan applications and tax returns), <em>faithfulness</em> (for example, meeting my loan obligations, working and studying diligently) and <em>self control</em> (for example, staying within my budget).</p>\n<p>For social scientists who take virtues seriously, the challenge is to admit the role of virtue and creatively to develop new approaches to a more complete model of behaviour.</p>\n<h2 class=\"new_page\">Further Reading</h2>\n<p>Agnew, J.

    "bodyText": "Disciplinary Note\n\nGiven the increasingly diverse and globalized world we live in, Herdt\u2019s inspiring work on the pagan and Christian sources of classical traditions in virtue ethics has encouraged me to explore and uncover ethical and religious virtue traditions in the worlds of the ancient Near East and China. Herdt\u2019s discussion of \u201cvirtues among non-Christians\u201d is suggestive because it raises the question of what makes a virtue Christian (or not) in particular contexts that I work with, i.e., pre-biblical and extra-biblical cultures, traditions, and texts.\n\nThis Brief offers a cross-cultural method for understanding virtues. It points to the centrality of cross-cultural borrowings in Old Testament wisdom literature. It then applies this method to construct a Christian Chinese conversation between classical Confucianist ethics and Pauline theology on virtues. My intention is to discern a cross-disciplinary approach to theology across academic fields, thus enriching Global Faculty Initiative conversations on virtues.\n\nDescriptively, \u201ccross-cultural interpretation\u201d refers to the use of diverse cultural resources by the biblical authors or biblical interpreters. Those resources include language, philosophy, and folklore. The contexts of the biblical authors are ancient Near Eastern for the OT or Greco Roman for the NT. And biblical interpreters engaging in cross-cultural work are those like Aquinas in his use of Aristotelian ethics, or my own use of Confucian ethics to dialogue with Pauline theology.\n\nPrescriptively, \u201ccross-cultural interpretation\u201d finds a biblical mandate to bridge gaps between the gospel and cultures, between faith and contexts, between theology and disciplinary research\u2014all in the interests of mutual transformation. All peoples are situated at culture-and-faith intersections. The cross-cultural method pays attention to contexts for a mutually creative process of transforming both cultures and biblical hermeneutics. This essay therefore seeks to show the benefits of bringing pagan and Christian wisdom into respectful and robust conversation.\n\nThe biblical cross-cultural method goes beyond binaries of \u201cyes\u201d or \u201cno\u201d (Yeo 2018: 46\u201347). This can be seen at work in Paul\u2019s conversation with the Corinthians: in this cosmopolitan context he invokes a crucified Christ to critique Greek wisdom and Jewish religion (1 Cor 1:17\u20132:5). Yet, in the Athenian pagan context of idol worship, Paul tries to lead his philosophical audience from their notion of an \u201cunknown god\u201d to Jesus and his resurrection (Acts 17:18).\n\nIn a cross-cultural biblical reading, many scholars are either too quick to speak of the \u201ccommon grace\u201d of international wisdom or too swift to judge non-Yahwistic wisdom as inferior to Israelite wisdom. Israelite ethicists in the OT intercultural world (Yeo 2012: 97-125) are aware of Near Eastern wisdom literatures which are comparable to those in the OT\u2013\u2013Sumerian, Old Babylonian, Akkadian of Mesopotamia, Egyptian, and West Semitic. The book of Proverbs, for instance, presents diversified forms and content regarding basic virtues, such as trust, hope, love, speech, kindness, generosity, justice, self-control. [\u00a01\u00a0] Sparks concludes that ancient scribal scholars and communities \u201cengaged in an active intercultural exchange of literature and ideas\u201d (Sparks 2005: 56, 78-79; emphasis mine). Near Eastern texts comparable to Proverbs include the Instructions of Shuruppak, the Instructions of Amenemope, and the Dialogue of \u0160ube\u2019awilum.\n\nThe discourse of extra-biblical virtues in Proverbs is not simply about ethical concerns. It also has a religious dimension\u2014albeit from a polytheistic worldview. Proverbs adapts the Egyptian principle of ma\u2019at to express the Israelite idea of Yahweh\u2019s order, justice, and truth. Proverbs seems to see Woman Wisdom as an alternative to ma\u2019at , thus renaming, indigenizing, and fulfilling ma\u2019at (the virtues of order, justice, and truth) in Yahweh\u2019s personhood and character. Proverbs is written as practical guidance to Israelite young men on how to flourish in society and discern order in areas such as homemaking, love relationships and business affairs (Prov 1\u20139; 31). By personifying wisdom in feminine imagery, Proverbs\u2019 hermeneutical move contrasts the choice Israelites faced between following the Woman Wisdom ( hokma ) of Yahweh that leads to life, or following woman folly (idols and goddesses) that leads to death. In Proverbs wise people are teachable (1:5; 9:8-9), and by learning, they develop a character with sound judgment. Fools however, especially in cultures doubly distorted by arrogance and diffidence, are unteachable, and thus becoming ignorant.\n\nProverbs highlights the twofold unique contribution of Israelite wisdom. First, its Yahweh-centered ethics, where \u201cthe fear of the Lord is the beginning of wisdom,\u201d is a precondition of human flourishing and acting wisely. Second, the Jewish torah (\u201cinstruction\u201d or \u201cteaching\u201d) presents the \u201ccommandments\u201d as underpinnings of the virtuous life (Longman 2024). In other words, Proverbs presents a theological ethics of one\u2019s relationships with self, others, and creation based on a relationship with Yahweh and his rules for life. Proverbs does not advocate a moral theology alone that makes virtues an end in themselves. Moral theology which lacks friendship with God runs the risk of gaining wisdom and virtues independent of God (cf. \u201cwise in their own eyes\u201d Prov 3:7). It risks alienation from one\u2019s source of life, and using divine wisdom as a tool to justify one\u2019s behaviors or own convenience.\n\nPerhaps surprisingly, Proverbs suggests not that \u201c love of God is the beginning of wisdom\u201d but rather \u201cfear\u201d ( yira\u2019 ). The English word \u201clove\u201d that translates the Hebrew term suggests the unconditional relationship one has with God, fitting a person to move toward friendship with God. But the wisdom of God is to move a person toward obedience , and so we have the English word \u201cfear\u201d\u2014 a deep reverence that forms and leads one to faithful obedience through the virtue of courage, avoiding the extremes of cowardice or rashness.\n\nThus Proverbs seeks to ground the virtue of wisdom on God and God\u2019s law. Wisdom enhances three dimensions of our life:\n\nJust as the authors of Proverbs (especially 22:17\u00ad\u201324:34) incorporate aspects of Egyptian wisdom, I propose that there is much value in bringing Galatians into dialogue with the Analects , the Confucianist pre-biblical wisdom collection. Cross-cultural hermeneutics is a mutual process whereby the biblical teachings re-interpret Confucian virtues, and the Chinese Bible has long used Confucian semantics to translate and express biblical moral teachings.\n\nA comprehensive study comparing biblical virtues with the Confucian \u201cfour cardinal principles and eight virtues\u201d [\u00a02\u00a0] exceeds the scope of this response, let alone if one wants to dialogue with the four Aristotelian-Thomist cardinal virtues and three theological virtues that Herdt mentions. Despite multiple differences between the two virtue traditions of Confucius and Paul, we can explore whether there is a mutually enriching effect in a conversation between Paul and Confucius on the sanctifying life as divine grace coupled with acquired virtues (see Herdt\u2019s \u201chow are the virtues acquired?\u201d section).\n\nThe OT tends to regard virtues such as wisdom as both divine gifts and human disciplines. Thus obeying God\u2019s laws means having communion with God, which in turn blossoms into a virtuous life benefiting oneself and others. In the NT, the question of human agency in virtue is often underscored\u2014as it is also in Reformation theologies between the contested views of Luther (justification over sanctification) and Calvin (progressive sanctification). Addressing his gentile audience, Paul accentuates the role of the Spirit of God in producing fruits of the Spirit (Gal 5\u20136) as one lives in Christ (3:26\u201329) by participating in his work of salvation and in the sanctifying work of the Spirit (Gal 3:27; 5:16). Paul maintains that those who profess to be followers of Christ are required also to do the things which are consonant with the example of Christ. For Paul, \u201cperfection\u201d is a theological goal of being fully human, namely, to be Christlike.\n\nConfucius, however, speaks of human moral actualization, and teaches the union of li and ren. The Confucian li is decorum in everyday social engagement. Ren means human-relatedness\u2014specifically as love or humaneness\u2014which is the cardinal principle of human relationships that \u201cdisplay virtue and renew the people\u201d ( Great Learning 1:1). The ritualizing interaction ( li ) with others naturally enables a person to be virtuous. For example, honor and respect are virtues that are cultivated in the social etiquette of the young towards the old within an extended family. In one\u2019s adult life, respect is then extended to public figures such as government officials ( Analects 1:5, 15:8) and rulers ( Analects 6:2). Li is the structure that forms ren as a virtue, and ren is the fountainhead of all the virtues. In Confucian ethics, the virtue of ren is about the cultivation of the heart\u2014a metaphor for the seat of rationality and emotion, i.e., the sensitivity and empathy one has toward others.\n\nGiven my particular cross-cultural context, as a Christian-Chinese scholar, I seek a \u201cmutually flourishing\u201d approach to the virtues. First, can Paul learn from the Analects ? The answer is \u201cyes.\u201d A Chinese Christian can gain insights by expressing Paul\u2019s theology in the ethical terms of Confucius. This in turn provides Chinese Christians with indigenized and practical ways to live out Christian virtues in Chinese society. It could bridge the gap for Chinese Christians between \u201c belief in God\u201d and \u201c living as children of God\u201d (Gal 3:23-4:31). Moreover, the theological ethics of the Pauline epistles have often been read by Chinese churches solely as doctrinal teaching about loving God. However, Confucius in the Analects advocates that everyone actualizes the mandate of Heaven ( Tian ) by committing oneself to ren (humaneness), because loving others makes human beings human.\n\nCan Confucius learn from Galatians? Confucius does share Paul\u2019s awe and reverence in matters related to life and death. But, for example, can Paul\u2019s understanding of the personhood of God (to speak, to love, to feel) redress inadequacies in Confucius\u2019s understanding of Tian ? Can the particular knowledge of God\u2019s personhood guide a Christian Chinese to live a virtuous life and to fear God? The answer is \u201cyes.\u201d\n\nLet me give an example of fruitful cross-cultural dialogue on the role of rites ( li ) in the cultivation of virtues. Whereas rites in Confucius\u2019 ethics have the goal of forming virtues, for Protestants, Christian rites such as baptism and the Lord\u2019s Supper do not have as their primary purpose the cultivation of Christian virtues. Orthodox and Catholic Christians, however, would agree with Confucius. Over the years, as a Christian Chinese, my own reading of the Analects on li and ren has shifted. While I see all-encompassing love as the power of the Holy Spirit that creates and sustains us, I am increasingly aware that Christ\u2019s Chinese followers are also fed and renewed through many cultural rites other than the Lord\u2019s Supper (which Christian Chinese call \u201cthe holy rite,\u201d sheng-li ). The tea ceremony, for example, cultivates friendship and instils virtues of honor and love for neighbors. Not all non-Christian virtues are to be rejected.\n\nThe \u201cmutually flourishing\u201d approach aims to overcome the fear of judging and condemning others as \u201cheretic\u201d (not in accord with orthodoxy) or \u201csyncretistic\u201d (not pure faith). It also aims to overcome the fear that leads to building borders or walls. For me to speak of \u201cPaul\u2019s way of li and ren \u201d in bearing the fruit of the Spirit is to imitate his \u201cLaw of Christ\u201d hermeneutic (Gal 6:2) of using the best resources of Jewish and gentile Christian identifiers to signify their oneness in the God of Jesus (Gal 2:20). This overcomes not only the Jewish missionary\u2019s ethnocentrism in coercing gentile believers to observe Jewish practices, but also the gentile world of licentiousness in \u201cthe works of the flesh\u201d (Gal 5:18-21).\n\nA Christian Chinese approach expresses Paul\u2019s reinterpretation of laws and Spirit via Confucius\u2019 understanding of li (rites) and ren (humaneness). A Pauline theology that is short on ethics is being \u201cenfleshed\u201d with Confucian ethical insights for a Chinese audience and society. Conversely, Confucius\u2019 understanding of ren and full humanity is comparable to\u2013\u2013and thus finds its fulfillment in\u2013\u2013Paul\u2019s understanding of Jesus Christ as God\u2019s Son who loves all people sacrificially.\n\nConfucius could agree with Paul, who writes that the purpose of the freedom God gives is to reach out to others\u2014\u201clove in becoming slaves to others\u201d (Gal 5:13). Paul\u2019s way of highlighting cruciform love enriches Confucius\u2019 understanding of ren . And Paul would agree with Confucius in seeing virtue ( de ) as the expression of heaven, and ren as the essence of being human.\n\nFor a Chinese Christian who lives in the unity of Confucian ethics and Pauline theology, I embrace divine grace as the foundation of ethics and cruciform love. Rites ( li ) become the way for Christians to be ren-ren (people who love others). The ideal Confucianist person of virtues, who has perfect love, wishes good to others even if divine goodness does not come to oneself.\n\nWisdom and virtue are cousins. Both of them call us academics to pursue God in our research and teaching, so that the world might witness ways to live life fully and flourishingly in the power of God\u2019s Spirit.\n\nHow can faith and our academic fields work together? I suggest that we begin with the \u201cfear of God,\u201d and know that \u201cfaith does not hinder knowledge; on the contrary, it liberates knowledge, enables it really to come to the point and indicates to it its proper place in the sphere of varied, human activity\u201d (von Rad 1972: 68).\n\nFurther, the theological virtue of \u201cfear of God\u201d places knowledge in its proper perspective. God holds all wisdom. Thus God\u2019s followers, through direct revelation (Bible study), observation and reflection on general revelation from our academic fields, live into a wisdom-conscious hermeneutics of reading God\u2019s world. We should resist binary thinking. It is not either culture or faith. Culture speaks to faith as faith speaks to culture. As our conversation between Confucius and Paul on the virtues well illustrates, a fully rounded understanding of the virtues in any given cultural context requires respect for the tradition of the culture as it encounters the revelation of the gospel.\n\nKeefer, Arthur Jan (2021).

Kendall Professor Emeritus of New Testament at Garrett-Evangelical Seminary</p>\n<p>Affiliate Professor, Department of Asian Languages and Cultures, Northwestern University, Evanston, Illinois</p>\n<h2>Introduction\u00a0</h2>\n<p>Given the increasingly diverse and globalized world we live in, Herdt\u2019s inspiring work on the pagan and Christian sources of classical traditions in virtue ethics has encouraged me to explore and uncover ethical and religious virtue traditions in the worlds of the ancient Near East and China. Herdt\u2019s discussion of \u201cvirtues among non-Christians\u201d is suggestive because it raises the question of what makes a virtue Christian (or not) in particular contexts that I work with, i.e., pre-biblical and extra-biblical cultures, traditions, and texts.</p>\n<p>This Brief offers a cross-cultural method for understanding virtues. It points to the centrality of cross-cultural borrowings in Old Testament wisdom literature. It then applies this method to construct a Christian Chinese conversation between classical Confucianist ethics and Pauline theology on virtues. My intention is to discern a cross-disciplinary approach to theology across academic fields, thus enriching Global Faculty Initiative conversations on virtues.</p>\n<h2>A Method of Cross-cultural Biblical Interpretation\u00a0</h2>\n<p>Descriptively, \u201ccross-cultural interpretation\u201d refers to the use of diverse cultural resources by the biblical authors or biblical interpreters. Those resources include language, philosophy, and folklore. The contexts of the biblical authors are ancient Near Eastern for the OT or Greco Roman for the NT. And biblical interpreters engaging in cross-cultural work are those like Aquinas in his use of Aristotelian ethics, or my own use of Confucian ethics to dialogue with Pauline theology.</p>\n<p>Prescriptively, \u201ccross-cultural interpretation\u201d finds a biblical mandate to bridge gaps between the gospel and cultures, between faith and contexts, between theology and disciplinary research\u2014all in the interests of mutual transformation. All peoples are situated at culture-and-faith intersections. The cross-cultural method pays attention to contexts for a mutually creative process of transforming both cultures and biblical hermeneutics. This essay therefore seeks to show the benefits of bringing pagan and Christian wisdom into respectful and robust conversation.</p>\n<p>The biblical cross-cultural method goes beyond binaries of \u201cyes\u201d or \u201cno\u201d (Yeo 2018: 46\u201347). This can be seen at work in Paul\u2019s conversation with the Corinthians: in this cosmopolitan context he invokes a crucified Christ to critique Greek wisdom and Jewish religion (1 Cor 1:17\u20132:5). Yet, in the Athenian pagan context of idol worship, Paul tries to lead his philosophical audience from their notion of an \u201cunknown god\u201d to Jesus and his resurrection (Acts 17:18).</p>\n<h2>Old Testament Wisdom on Virtues\u00a0</h2>\n<p>In a cross-cultural biblical reading, many scholars are either too quick to speak of the \u201ccommon grace\u201d of international wisdom or too swift to judge non-Yahwistic wisdom as inferior to Israelite wisdom. Israelite ethicists in the OT intercultural world (Yeo 2012: 97-125) are aware of Near Eastern wisdom literatures which are comparable to those in the OT\u2013\u2013Sumerian, Old Babylonian, Akkadian of Mesopotamia, Egyptian, and West Semitic. The book of Proverbs, for instance, presents diversified<em> </em>forms and content regarding basic virtues, such as trust, hope, love, speech, kindness, generosity, justice, self-control.<a class=\"anchor\" id=\"content100note1anc\" name=\"content100note1anc\">\u00a0</a><a class=\"note\" href=\"#content100note1sym\">[\u00a01\u00a0]</a><sup> </sup>Sparks concludes that ancient scribal scholars and communities \u201cengaged in an <em>active </em>intercultural exchange of literature and ideas\u201d (Sparks 2005: 56, 78-79; emphasis mine). Near Eastern texts comparable to Proverbs include the Instructions of Shuruppak, the Instructions of Amenemope, and the Dialogue of \u0160ube\u2019awilum.</p>\n<p>The discourse of extra-biblical virtues in Proverbs is not simply about ethical concerns. It also has a religious dimension\u2014albeit from a polytheistic worldview. Proverbs adapts the Egyptian principle of <em>ma\u2019at</em> to express the Israelite idea of Yahweh\u2019s order, justice, and truth. Proverbs seems to see Woman Wisdom as an alternative to <em>ma\u2019at</em>, thus renaming, indigenizing, and fulfilling <em>ma\u2019at</em> (the virtues of order, justice, and truth) in Yahweh\u2019s personhood and character. Proverbs is written as practical guidance to Israelite young men on how to flourish in society and discern order in areas such as homemaking, love relationships and business affairs (Prov 1\u20139; 31). By personifying wisdom in feminine imagery, Proverbs\u2019 hermeneutical move contrasts the choice Israelites faced between following the Woman Wisdom (<em>hokma</em>) of Yahweh that leads to life, or following woman folly (idols and goddesses) that leads to death. In Proverbs wise people are teachable (1:5; 9:8-9), and by learning, they develop a character with sound judgment. Fools however, especially in cultures doubly distorted by arrogance and diffidence, are unteachable, and thus becoming ignorant.</p>\n<p>Proverbs highlights the twofold unique contribution of Israelite wisdom. First, its Yahweh-centered ethics, where \u201cthe fear of the Lord is the beginning of wisdom,\u201d is a precondition of human flourishing and acting wisely. Second, the Jewish <em>torah</em> (\u201cinstruction\u201d or \u201cteaching\u201d) presents the \u201ccommandments\u201d as underpinnings of the virtuous life (Longman 2024). In other words, Proverbs presents a <em>theological</em> ethics of one\u2019s relationships with self, others, and creation based on a relationship with Yahweh and his rules for life. Proverbs does not advocate a <em>moral</em> theology alone that makes virtues an end in themselves. Moral theology which lacks friendship with God runs the risk of gaining wisdom and virtues independent of God (cf. \u201cwise in their <em>own</em> eyes\u201d Prov 3:7). It risks alienation from one\u2019s source of life, and using divine wisdom as a tool to justify one\u2019s behaviors or own convenience.</p>\n<p>Perhaps surprisingly, Proverbs suggests not that \u201c<em>love</em> of God is the beginning of wisdom\u201d but rather \u201cfear\u201d (<em>yira\u2019</em>). The English word \u201clove\u201d that translates the Hebrew term suggests the unconditional relationship one has with God, fitting a person to move toward friendship with God. But the wisdom of God is to move a person toward <em>obedience</em>, and so we have the English word \u201cfear\u201d\u2014 a deep reverence that forms and leads one to faithful obedience through the virtue of courage, avoiding the extremes of cowardice or rashness.</p>\n<p>Thus Proverbs seeks to ground the virtue of wisdom on God and God\u2019s law. Wisdom enhances three dimensions of our life:</p>\n<h2>Dialogue between Confucian Ethics and Paul on Virtues\u00a0</h2>\n<p>Just as the authors of Proverbs (especially 22:17\u00ad\u201324:34) incorporate aspects of Egyptian wisdom, I propose that there is much value in bringing Galatians into dialogue with the <em>Analects</em>, the Confucianist pre-biblical wisdom collection. Cross-cultural hermeneutics is a mutual process whereby the biblical teachings re-interpret Confucian virtues, and the Chinese Bible has long used Confucian semantics to translate and express biblical moral teachings.</p>\n<p>A comprehensive study comparing biblical virtues with the Confucian \u201cfour cardinal principles and eight virtues\u201d<a class=\"anchor\" id=\"content100note2anc\" name=\"content100note2anc\">\u00a0</a><a class=\"note\" href=\"#content100note2sym\">[\u00a02\u00a0]</a> exceeds the scope of this response, let alone if one wants to dialogue with the four Aristotelian-Thomist cardinal virtues and three theological virtues that Herdt mentions. Despite multiple differences between the two virtue traditions of Confucius and Paul, we can explore whether there is a mutually enriching effect in a conversation between Paul and Confucius on the sanctifying life as divine grace coupled with acquired virtues (see Herdt\u2019s \u201chow are the virtues acquired?\u201d section).</p>\n<p>The OT tends to regard virtues such as wisdom as both divine gifts and human disciplines. Thus obeying God\u2019s laws means having communion with God, which in turn blossoms into a virtuous life benefiting oneself and others. In the NT, the question of human agency in virtue is often underscored\u2014as it is also in Reformation theologies between the contested views of Luther (justification over sanctification) and Calvin (progressive sanctification). Addressing his gentile audience, Paul accentuates the role of the Spirit of God in producing fruits of the Spirit (Gal 5\u20136) as one lives in Christ (3:26\u201329) by participating in his work of salvation and in the sanctifying work of the Spirit (Gal 3:27; 5:16). Paul maintains that those who profess to be followers of Christ are required also<em> </em>to do the things which are consonant with the example of Christ. For Paul, \u201cperfection\u201d is a <em>theological</em> goal of being fully human, namely, to be Christlike.</p>\n<p>Confucius, however, speaks of human <em>moral </em>actualization, and teaches the union of <em>li</em> and <em>ren. </em>The Confucian <em>li </em>is decorum in everyday social engagement. <em>Ren</em> means human-relatedness\u2014specifically as love or humaneness\u2014which is the cardinal principle of human relationships that \u201cdisplay virtue and renew the people\u201d (<em>Great Learning</em> 1:1). The ritualizing interaction (<em>li</em>)<em> </em>with others naturally enables a person to be virtuous. For example, honor and respect are virtues that are cultivated in the social etiquette of the young towards the old within an extended family. In one\u2019s adult life, respect is then extended to public figures such as government officials (<em>Analects</em> 1:5, 15:8) and rulers (<em>Analects</em> 6:2). <em>Li </em>is the structure that forms <em>ren</em> as a virtue, and <em>ren</em> is the fountainhead of all the virtues. In Confucian ethics, the virtue of <em>ren</em> is about the cultivation of the heart\u2014a metaphor for the seat of rationality and emotion, i.e., the sensitivity and empathy one has toward others.</p>\n<p>Given my particular cross-cultural context, as a Christian-Chinese scholar, I seek a \u201cmutually flourishing\u201d approach to the virtues. First, can Paul learn from <em>the Analects</em>? The answer is \u201cyes.\u201d A <em>Chinese</em> Christian can gain insights by expressing Paul\u2019s theology in the ethical terms of Confucius. This in turn provides <em>Chinese</em> Christians with indigenized and practical ways to live out Christian virtues in <em>Chinese</em> society. It could bridge the gap for Chinese Christians between \u201c<em>belief </em>in God\u201d and \u201c<em>living</em> as children of God\u201d (Gal 3:23-4:31). Moreover, the theological ethics of the Pauline epistles have often been read by Chinese churches solely as doctrinal teaching about loving God. However, Confucius in <em>the Analects</em> advocates that everyone actualizes the mandate of Heaven (<em>Tian</em>) by committing oneself to <em>ren</em> (humaneness), because loving others makes human beings human.</p>\n<p>Can Confucius learn from Galatians? Confucius does share Paul\u2019s awe and reverence in matters related to life and death. But, for example, can Paul\u2019s understanding of the personhood of God (to speak, to love, to feel) redress inadequacies in Confucius\u2019s understanding of <em>Tian</em>? Can the particular knowledge of God\u2019s personhood guide a <em>Christian</em> Chinese to live a virtuous life and to fear God? The answer is \u201cyes.\u201d</p>\n<p>Let me give an example of fruitful cross-cultural dialogue on the role of rites (<em>li</em>) in the cultivation of virtues. Whereas rites in Confucius\u2019 ethics have the goal of forming virtues, for Protestants, Christian rites such as baptism and the Lord\u2019s Supper do not have as their primary purpose the cultivation of Christian virtues. Orthodox and Catholic Christians, however, would agree with Confucius. Over the years, as a Christian Chinese, my own reading of the<em> Analects</em> on <em>li </em>and <em>ren</em> has shifted. While I see all-encompassing love as the power of the Holy Spirit that creates and sustains us, I am increasingly aware that Christ\u2019s Chinese followers are also fed and renewed through many cultural rites other than the Lord\u2019s Supper (which Christian Chinese call \u201cthe holy rite,\u201d <em>sheng-li</em>). The tea ceremony, for example, cultivates friendship and instils virtues of honor and love for neighbors. Not all non-Christian virtues are to be rejected.</p>\n<p>The \u201cmutually flourishing\u201d approach aims to overcome the fear of judging and condemning others as \u201cheretic\u201d (not in accord with orthodoxy) or \u201csyncretistic\u201d (not pure faith). It also aims to overcome the fear that leads to building borders or walls. For me to speak of \u201cPaul\u2019s way of <em>li </em>and <em>ren</em>\u201d in bearing the fruit of the Spirit is to imitate his \u201cLaw of Christ\u201d hermeneutic (Gal 6:2) of using the best resources of Jewish and gentile Christian identifiers to signify their oneness in the God of Jesus (Gal 2:20). This overcomes not only the Jewish missionary\u2019s ethnocentrism in coercing gentile believers to observe Jewish practices, but also the gentile world of licentiousness in \u201cthe works of the flesh\u201d (Gal 5:18-21).</p>\n<p>A Christian Chinese approach expresses Paul\u2019s reinterpretation of laws and Spirit via Confucius\u2019 understanding of <em>li</em> (rites) and <em>ren</em> (humaneness). A Pauline theology that is short on ethics is being \u201cenfleshed\u201d with Confucian ethical insights for a Chinese audience and society. Conversely, Confucius\u2019 understanding of <em>ren</em> and full humanity is comparable to\u2013\u2013and thus finds its fulfillment in\u2013\u2013Paul\u2019s understanding of Jesus Christ as God\u2019s Son who loves all people sacrificially.</p>\n<p>Confucius could agree with Paul, who writes that the purpose of the freedom God gives is to reach out to others\u2014\u201clove in becoming slaves to others\u201d (Gal 5:13). Paul\u2019s way of highlighting cruciform love enriches Confucius\u2019 understanding of <em>ren</em>. And Paul would agree with Confucius in seeing virtue (<em>de</em>) as the expression of heaven, and <em>ren</em> as the essence of being human.</p>\n<p>For a Chinese Christian who lives in the unity of Confucian ethics <em>and</em> Pauline theology, I embrace divine grace as the foundation of ethics and cruciform love. Rites (<em>li</em>) become the way for Christians to be <em>ren-ren</em> (people who love others). The ideal Confucianist person of virtues, who has perfect love, wishes good to others even if divine goodness does not come to oneself.</p>\n<h2>The Global Faculty Initiative as a Cross-Disciplinary and Cross-Cultural Forum\u00a0</h2>\n<p>Wisdom and virtue are cousins.

Whose Virtue? Whose Morality?\n\nDespite competing views about what literature is and what it does (or should do), and the sources that inform literary creation and criticism, all of these writers and thinkers would agree that literature creates a moral space , which is decidedly not the same thing as teaching particular moral values or explicitly commending certain perennial human virtues. Even Eliot distanced his views from Christian literature that was too pedantic, too unlike the literature he esteemed. What kind of moral spaces does poetry, fiction, drama, create? I would argue that what some may find to be its deficiency is in fact one of its greatest advantages in this regard: literature creates and generates moral complexity . Yes, the embodiment of virtuous lives (or lives in need of virtue) has affective pull that other kinds of texts do not, and for this reason we may commend literature as a distinctive vehicle for inculcating moral vision and virtuous aspirations through its characters or personae. We want to be like them (or not)! (One thinks of the heroes of great drama or of epic fantasies such as The Lord of the Rings here.)\n\nBut as with biblical narrative, protagonists are also fraught with their own weaknesses and moral deficiencies. Literature embodies such ambiguities and multi-valences in ways that connect with our own, usually equally fraught, moral lives. This is not to say that the ambition to live a virtuous life is treated best when that prospect is held in abeyance because of the failure to fulfill it. But to acknowledge, as literature often enables us to do, that we are complicated creatures who often find ourselves in morally ambiguous situations, as often as not the product of our own [un]doing. What literature does distinctively, regardless of whether or not it is rooted in explicit religious commitments, is to provoke moral urgency . Some of the best literature in terms of the cultivation of a virtuous life is not the fiction or poetry or drama that resolve into a clear moral vision, but those which make us want to find such a vision, and to find it embodied in our own lives. In this respect, Jennifer Herdt\u2019s category of \u2018developing virtues\u2019 fits best with what literature can so powerfully influence.\n\nAmong the many writers I would commend on this score, I think of the Catholic fiction writers Graham Greene, Flannery O\u2019Connor, and Walker Percy, or the agnostic genius Cormac McCarthy.\n\nOne other comment I would add, regarding \u2018virtuous reading,\u2019 what literary critic Alan Jacobs calls \u201cthe hermeneutics of love\u201d in his book of that title.

After all, the development of technology is a condition of possibility for social communication. Later on my academic career, as a Researcher in the field of Media, Religion and Culture , I have studied Evangelical media in Brazil from the 20th to the 21st century. I concluded, then, that there was an understanding among this social group that technologies were neutral, and this was based upon a clear distinction between technique and content \u2013 with the later been considered as more valuable. Virtue was in the content. But Professor Herdt\u2019s brief repositioned this relation: is technology neutral with respect to morals or virtues?\n\nThis question (partially) leads me to my second strand of considerations: social media and public life . I say partially, because technique and technology are an indispensable part of social media \u2013 and as consequence, for contemporary public life. But technology is not the only component of social media \u2013 which is a complex kind of media (here I will drop the use of the notion of techne because social media begins when there is a fusion between technique and logos ). There are technological and human elements in this space, where there seems to be a blurring between humanity and technology. Are these technological elements neutral? Can they be said to be virtuous or evil? In media, the human is everyday more similar to his or her own technological production. Are social exclusion, the growth of individualism, the impossibility of dialogue, the fostering of extremism to be considered technological phenomena only? Or are they human phenomena? Or do they belong to the media alone? Or is media per se also capable of generating communities and fostering affection and actions of compassion, mutual recognition, and happiness? Are they capable of cultivating virtues? Recently I have started research on the realities of dissemination of Fake News among Evangelicals in Brazil. It is surprising to see how deep this social group was connected to the dissemination of disinformation that has taken over the country since the Presidential elections of 2018. Questions related to virtues, including (or specially) theological ones, are important to reflect on these relations. Might the cultivation of virtues in individuals and institutions like the media forestall or prevent fake news or distortion of news?\n\nThe relation between virtues and institutions is particularly intriguing. Here, postcolonialism could \u2013 or perhaps, should \u2013 be a starting point. This might sound strange in western societies, in countries religiously Christian and historically part of empires. But for a colonized citizen of a former colony, in countries determined by huge social inequalities, to raise the question about the possibility of virtue in institutions (especially political or governmental institutions) is to risk complete misunderstanding or being made the object of ridicule. States and their apparatus are considered intrinsically unjust and beyond fixing. There is no doubt about it. The majority of the population does not feel represented by their institutions and does not effectively participate in these institutions. That might be the reason why anti-corruption discourses are so attractive \u2013 even when coming from the most corrupted mouths. In Brazil, the \u201cmorality of politics\u201d is a vivid and common expression in political discourse. However, it is a morality that is never close, never effective and eventually serves purposes that are anti-political, flirting with and feeding on fascist experiences of our recent history. In Brazil, the question about the possibility of overlap between virtue and politics, virtue and social institutions, is urgent.

    "bodyText": "In her essay on The Virtues , Professor Herdt offers a warm and engaging account of the nature and importance of moral character in Christian ethics. In this short comment, I offer a brief exploration of one of the important observations with which she begins her essay.\n\nProfessor Herdt commences by pointing out that the rules or principles that define good conduct require people capable of putting them into practice. Principles, she notes, \u201cmust be interpreted in order to be applied, and this requires good judgement\u201d. \u201cWithout the virtues,\u201d she continues, \u201cno moral code, however perfect, can ensure that we act well.\u201d\n\nDespite the sense that rule-based systems of morality are somehow opposed to character-based systems of morality, it seems that both rules and character are essential components of ethical behaviour. Thomas Aquinas particularly suggests this in his discussion of the virtue of prudence. Following Aristotle, he affirms that \u201cprudence is right reason applied to action\u201d, but he then points out that actions are singular or particular, and that prudence consists in the application of \u201cuniversal rules to particular cases\u201d ( Summa Theologica II-II, 47.2 and 47.3). Accordingly, the prudent person must \u201cknow both the universal principles of reason, and the singulars about which actions are concerned\u201d (ST II-II, 47.3).\n\nThis could be taken to suggest that good actions are simply a matter of following rules, but Aquinas\u2019s point is more subtle than this. The particulars to which the universal rules are to be applied are \u201ccontingent\u201d, \u201cinfinite in number\u201d and \u201ccontain many combinations of circumstances\u201d (ST II-II, 45.5, 47.3 and 49.7). It follows that particular cases involve factual situations of great complexity and variability, which test the limits of human memory and understanding (ST II-II, 49.1 and 49.2), and which require us to be solicitous, teachable, circumspect and cautious in our practical judgments (ST II-II, 47.9, ST II-II, 49.3, 49.7 and 49.8). As human beings limited in time and place, we find it practically necessary to rely on an understanding of these matters derived from experience, focusing on what is true and right \u201cin the majority of cases\u201d (ST II-II, 49.1).\n\nIn many situations, we exercise judgment according to these commonplace \u201crules of thumb\u201d, but there are also situations in which the common rules are insufficient or inapposite, in which cases we have to judge according to higher and more universal principles (ST II-II, 51.3 and 51.4). Accordingly, while prudence consists in the application of universal rules to particular cases, it requires considerable qualities of character to discern, judge and act rightly. Without them, we are prone to allow impulses of will and passion, as well as thoughtlessness, inconstancy and negligence, to impel us into acting carelessly, rashly or precipitously, and thus imprudently (ST II-II, 53.3, 53.4, 53.5 and 54.1).\n\nAccordingly, acting rightly is not simply a matter of applying rules to factual situations. It requires good judgment, which is a quality of character. This brings into a view another implication. Prudential judgment is needed in different spheres of life, one of which is the governance of a political community, which Aquinas calls the \u201cregnative\u201d species of prudence (ST II-II, 50.1), together with the corresponding virtue of being a good subject, which Aquinas calls the \u201cpolitical\u201d species of prudence (ST II-II, 50.2). By maintaining that the virtue of prudence extends to both the responsibility of governing and the responsibility of obeying, Aquinas underscores that qualities of character are needed in both ruler and ruled.\n\nIt follows that prudent governance will not consist simply in the multiplication of rules in order to secure good conduct. The particular situations to which rules must be applied are too contingent and complex for a discrete set of rules, no matter how sophisticated and comprehensive, to provide sufficient specific guidance for good conduct in every situation that will arise. Moreover, the individuals to whom these rules are addressed are not irrational or inanimate beings set in motion by simple command; rather, as free and responsible agents, they are moved by the commands of others only as they move themselves through the exercise of their own responsible free will (ST II-II, 50.2).\n\nWithout some rectitude in the population, no laws will cause us to obey, or to obey well. Merely multiplying the rules, and backing them with sanctions, may impel a degree of outward obedience, but not the sort of good conduct that is the mark of a person of good character. Indeed, the mere multiplication of rules can have many unintended bad consequences, and serve to burden those of good will without effectively controlling the behaviour of those who care less.\n\nAnd yet one of the characteristics of our time, as Oliver O\u2019Donovan has pointed out, has been an \u201cincessant stream of lawmaking\u201d. [\u00a01\u00a0] The quantity and complexity of the law continues to increase without measure. In the decade of the 1990s, the Australian Parliament, for example, enacted over 54,000 pages of legislation. [\u00a02\u00a0] It seems we live in an age of \u201cunbounded confidence in the value and efficacy of law as an engine of social and moral improvement\u201d, as one experienced jurist has put it. [\u00a03\u00a0]\n\nHowever, as Professor Herdt has pointed out, the codes of conduct that govern behaviour require people capable of putting them into practice. It is difficult to avoid the conclusion that, having largely abandoned interest or hope in virtue, our governments have turned to law as their resource of first and final resort. But if personal character is a necessary basis for the development of healthy societies, then governments need to allow more space, and to actively encourage, the development of character in the population generally.\n\nHow is this to be done? [\u00a04\u00a0] Governments need to recognise and support the vital contributions made by healthy families, vibrant local communities and wider institutions of civil society to the development of good character. Education can play an important role, but only if it is conceived not only as an undertaking directed to the transference of knowledge and the acquisition skills, but also to the inculcation of wisdom and virtue. But even education is insufficient if it doesn\u2019t grapple with the deepest drivers of human motivation and behaviour.\n\nSocrates and Plato recognised that the development of good character requires a conversion of the soul. [\u00a05\u00a0] However, they also considered that the ultimate cause of human failing is ignorance because human beings by nature pursue that which they consider to be good. Evil occurs, therefore, because we are ignorant of the truly good, and so we pursue that which is evil, mistaking it for good. And thus the remedy lies in acquiring knowledge. [\u00a06\u00a0]\n\nAugustine of Hippo begged to differ. He considered that a truly good character requires a conversion of the soul that goes further than anything Socrates or Plato imagined. This is because Augustine recognised that the human soul is not naturally moved towards the good. [\u00a07\u00a0] The fundamental problem of human nature is not a deficiency of the mind; rather, it is a defect of the will. He believed that human pride is our fundamental problem, and that humility must be the first and essential step towards our moral improvement. As Alasdair MacIntyre has explained, it is only through a \u2018transformation of the will from a state of pride to one of humility that the intelligence can be rightly directed\u2019. For the will \u2018is more fundamental than intelligence and thinking undirected by a will informed by humility will always be apt to go astray\u2019. [\u00a08\u00a0]\n\nAugustine offered a striking image of this problem when he wrote of \u2018Pleasure\u2019, sitting \u2018like a voluptuous queen on a royal throne\u2019, with all the virtues arrayed around her as her attendant handmaidens, ready to do whatever she might command. [\u00a09\u00a0] The image suggests that a person might adopt certain virtuous practices\u2014for example, by being wise, moderate and fair in his dealings with other people\u2014but not out of the goodness of his heart, nor even for the good of those people, but only as means of satisfying his selfish desires. Augustine points out that human pride and the desire for glory works the same way. These motivate us not to do good for its own sake but only to do good\u2014or more precisely, to appear to do good\u2014so that others will think well of us and we will get more out of them. In this way, human pride is the deepest root of our problems, for it infects us even at our very best moments when we appear to be doing good. But because the desire for glory and honour only motivates us to appear to be good, it doesn\u2019t motivate us to do what is right when no one is looking, when no one sees, or when we can get away with it. And herein lies the root of all our problems.\n\nThis is why even education cannot provide the deepest solution to our problems. For Augustine, the solution lay in religion, properly understood. Religion in this sense goes further than education, because it forces us to ask deep questions about our motivations. It forces us to self-examination. And it challenges us to confess and to repent\u2014not just to confess the truth about our outward actions and behaviours, but to repent of our darkest inward thoughts and desires. It sets before us a model not of self-justification and self-rationalisation, but of candid acknowledgement of our failures. [\u00a010\u00a0] And it presses us to admit that we are in need of forgiveness, and that we need to forgive one-another. [\u00a011\u00a0]\n\nReligion in this sense is more than mere education and it is much more than mere law. Education without religion can only inform the mind and train the hand; it cannot convert the soul. Law without religion can only require outward conformity and punish when there is disobedience; it cannot redirect the heart. Law and education therefore need to leave room for religion, so that religion can do what it alone is capable of: soften the heart and redirect the will.\n\n[\u00a01\u00a0] Oliver O\u2019Donovan, \u201cGovernment as Judgment\u201d, First Things , April 1999.\n\n[\u00a02\u00a0] Michael McHugh, \u201cThe Growth of Legislation and Litigation\u201d (1995) 69(1) Australian Law Journal 37.\n\n[\u00a03\u00a0] Jonathan Sumption, \u201cThe Limits of Law,\u201d in Barber, Ekins and Yowell (eds), Lord Sumption and the Limits of the Law , Oxford: Hart Publishing, 2016.\n\n[\u00a04\u00a0] This section draws on Nicholas Aroney, \u2018Law, Education and Religion \u2013 Pathways to the Good Society?\u2019 (2020) 252 St Marks Review 19.\n\n[\u00a05\u00a0] Plato, Republic , Bk VII, 518b-d.\n\n[\u00a06\u00a0] Plato, Protagoras , 352c, 358b-d.\n\n[\u00a07\u00a0] Alasdair MacIntyre, Three Rival Versions of Moral Inquiry: Encyclopaedia, Genealogy, and Tradition (London: Duckworth, 1990) 84.\n\n[\u00a08\u00a0] MacIntyre, Three Rival Versions of Moral Inquiry , 91.\n\n[\u00a09\u00a0] Augustine, City of God , Bk V, ch 20.\n\n[\u00a010\u00a0] Luke 18:9-14.\n\n[\u00a011\u00a0] Matthew 18:21-35.",

In the decade of the 1990s, the Australian Parliament, for example, enacted over 54,000 pages of legislation.<a class=\"anchor\" id=\"content100note2anc\" name=\"content100note2anc\">\u00a0</a><a class=\"note\" href=\"#content100note2sym\">[\u00a02\u00a0]</a> It seems we live in an age of \u201cunbounded confidence in the value and efficacy of law as an engine of social and moral improvement\u201d, as one experienced jurist has put it.<a class=\"anchor\" id=\"content100note3anc\" name=\"content100note3anc\">\u00a0</a><a class=\"note\" href=\"#content100note3sym\">[\u00a03\u00a0]</a></p>\n<p>However, as Professor Herdt has pointed out, the codes of conduct that govern behaviour require people capable of putting them into practice. It is difficult to avoid the conclusion that, having largely abandoned interest or hope in virtue, our governments have turned to law as their resource of first and final resort. But if personal character is a necessary basis for the development of healthy societies, then governments need to allow more space, and to actively encourage, the development of character in the population generally.</p>\n<p>How is this to be done?<a class=\"anchor\" id=\"content100note4anc\" name=\"content100note4anc\">\u00a0</a><a class=\"note\" href=\"#content100note4sym\">[\u00a04\u00a0]</a> Governments need to recognise and support the vital contributions made by healthy families, vibrant local communities and wider institutions of civil society to the development of good character. Education can play an important role, but only if it is conceived not only as an undertaking directed to the transference of knowledge and the acquisition skills, but also to the inculcation of wisdom and virtue. But even education is insufficient if it doesn\u2019t grapple with the deepest drivers of human motivation and behaviour.</p>\n<p>Socrates and Plato recognised that the development of good character requires a conversion of the soul.<a class=\"anchor\" id=\"content100note5anc\" name=\"content100note5anc\">\u00a0</a><a class=\"note\" href=\"#content100note5sym\">[\u00a05\u00a0]</a> However, they also considered that the ultimate cause of human failing is ignorance because human beings by nature pursue that which they consider to be good. Evil occurs, therefore, because we are ignorant of the truly good, and so we pursue that which is evil, mistaking it for good. And thus the remedy lies in acquiring knowledge.<a class=\"anchor\" id=\"content100note6anc\" name=\"content100note6anc\">\u00a0</a><a class=\"note\" href=\"#content100note6sym\">[\u00a06\u00a0]</a></p>\n<p>Augustine of Hippo begged to differ. He considered that a truly good character requires a conversion of the soul that goes further than anything Socrates or Plato imagined. This is because Augustine recognised that the human soul is <i>not</i> naturally moved towards the good.<a class=\"anchor\" id=\"content100note7anc\" name=\"content100note7anc\">\u00a0</a><a class=\"note\" href=\"#content100note7sym\">[\u00a07\u00a0]</a> The fundamental problem of human nature is not a deficiency of the mind; rather, it is a defect of the will. He believed that human pride is our fundamental problem, and that humility must be the first and essential step towards our moral improvement. As Alasdair MacIntyre has explained, it is only through a \u2018transformation of the will from a state of pride to one of humility that the intelligence can be rightly directed\u2019. For the will \u2018is more fundamental than intelligence and thinking undirected by a will informed by humility will always be apt to go astray\u2019.<a class=\"anchor\" id=\"content100note8anc\" name=\"content100note8anc\">\u00a0</a><a class=\"note\" href=\"#content100note8sym\">[\u00a08\u00a0]</a></p>\n<p>Augustine offered a striking image of this problem when he wrote of \u2018Pleasure\u2019, sitting \u2018like a voluptuous queen on a royal throne\u2019, with all the virtues arrayed around her as her attendant handmaidens, ready to do whatever she might command.<a class=\"anchor\" id=\"content100note9anc\" name=\"content100note9anc\">\u00a0</a><a class=\"note\" href=\"#content100note9sym\">[\u00a09\u00a0]</a> The image suggests that a person might adopt certain virtuous practices\u2014for example, by being wise, moderate and fair in his dealings with other people\u2014but not out of the goodness of his heart, nor even for the good of those people, but only as means of satisfying his selfish desires. Augustine points out that human pride and the desire for glory works the same way. These motivate us not to do good for its own sake but only to do good\u2014or more precisely, to <i>appear</i> to do good\u2014so that others will think well of us and we will get more out of them. In this way, human pride is the deepest root of our problems, for it infects us even at our very best moments when we appear to be doing good. But because the desire for glory and honour only motivates us to appear to be good, it doesn\u2019t motivate us to do what is right when no one is looking, when no one sees, or when we can get away with it. And herein lies the root of all our problems.</p>\n<p>This is why even education cannot provide the deepest solution to our problems. For Augustine, the solution lay in religion, properly understood. Religion in this sense goes further than education, because it forces us to ask deep questions about our motivations. It forces us to self-examination. And it challenges us to confess and to repent\u2014not just to confess the truth about our outward actions and behaviours, but to repent of our darkest inward thoughts and desires. It sets before us a model not of self-justification and self-rationalisation, but of candid acknowledgement of our failures.<a class=\"anchor\" id=\"content100note10anc\" name=\"content100note10anc\">\u00a0</a><a class=\"note\" href=\"#content100note10sym\">[\u00a010\u00a0]</a> And it presses us to admit that we are in need of forgiveness, and that we need to forgive one-another.<a class=\"anchor\" id=\"content100note11anc\" name=\"content100note11anc\">\u00a0</a><a class=\"note\" href=\"#content100note11sym\">[\u00a011\u00a0]</a></p>\n<p>Religion in this sense is more than mere education and it is much more than mere law. Education without religion can only inform the mind and train the hand; it cannot convert the soul. Law without religion can only require outward conformity and punish when there is disobedience; it cannot redirect the heart. Law and education therefore need to leave room for religion, so that religion can do what it alone is capable of: soften the heart and redirect the will.</p>\n<p class=\"endnote\"><a class=\"note\" href=\"#content100note1anc\">[\u00a01\u00a0]</a><a class=\"anchor\" id=\"content100note1sym\" name=\"content100note1sym\">\u00a0</a> Oliver O\u2019Donovan, \u201cGovernment as Judgment\u201d, <i>First Things</i>, April 1999.</p>\n<p class=\"endnote\"><a class=\"note\" href=\"#content100note2anc\">[\u00a02\u00a0]</a><a class=\"anchor\" id=\"content100note2sym\" name=\"content100note2sym\">\u00a0</a> Michael McHugh, \u201cThe Growth of Legislation and Litigation\u201d (1995) 69(1) <i>Australian Law Journal</i> 37.</p>\n<p class=\"endnote\"><a class=\"note\" href=\"#content100note3anc\">[\u00a03\u00a0]</a><a class=\"anchor\" id=\"content100note3sym\" name=\"content100note3sym\">\u00a0</a> Jonathan Sumption, \u201cThe Limits of Law,\u201d in Barber, Ekins and Yowell (eds), <i>Lord Sumption and the Limits of the Law</i>, Oxford: Hart Publishing, 2016.</p>\n<p class=\"endnote\"><a class=\"note\" href=\"#content100note4anc\">[\u00a04\u00a0]</a><a class=\"anchor\" id=\"content100note4sym\" name=\"content100note4sym\">\u00a0</a> This section draws on Nicholas Aroney, \u2018Law, Education and Religion \u2013 Pathways to the Good Society?\u2019 (2020) 252 <i>St Marks Review</i> 19.</p>\n<p class=\"endnote\"><a class=\"note\" href=\"#content100note5anc\">[\u00a05\u00a0]</a><a class=\"anchor\" id=\"content100note5sym\" name=\"content100note5sym\">\u00a0</a> Plato, <i>Republic</i>, Bk VII, 518b-d.</p>\n<p class=\"endnote\"><a class=\"note\" href=\"#content100note6anc\">[\u00a06\u00a0]</a><a class=\"anchor\" id=\"content100note6sym\" name=\"content100note6sym\">\u00a0</a> Plato, <i>Protagoras</i>, 352c, 358b-d.</p>\n<p class=\"endnote\"><a class=\"note\" href=\"#content100note7anc\">[\u00a07\u00a0]</a><a class=\"anchor\" id=\"content100note7sym\" name=\"content100note7sym\">\u00a0</a> Alasdair MacIntyre, <i>Three Rival Versions of Moral Inquiry: Encyclopaedia, Genealogy, and Tradition </i>(London: Duckworth, 1990)<i> </i>84.</p>\n<p class=\"endnote\"><a class=\"note\" href=\"#content100note8anc\">[\u00a08\u00a0]</a><a class=\"anchor\" id=\"content100note8sym\" name=\"content100note8sym\">\u00a0</a> MacIntyre,<i> Three Rival Versions of Moral Inquiry</i>,<i> </i>91.</p>\n<p class=\"endnote\"><a class=\"note\" href=\"#content100note9anc\">[\u00a09\u00a0]</a><a class=\"anchor\" id=\"content100note9sym\" name=\"content100note9sym\">\u00a0</a> Augustine, <i>City of God</i>, Bk V, ch 20.</p>\n<p class=\"endnote\"><a class=\"note\" href=\"#content100note10anc\">[\u00a010\u00a0]</a><a class=\"anchor\" id=\"content100note10sym\" name=\"content100note10sym\">\u00a0</a> <i>Luke </i>18:9-14.</p>\n<p class=\"endnote\"><a class=\"note\" href=\"#content100note11anc\">[\u00a011\u00a0]</a><a class=\"anchor\" id=\"content100note11sym\" name=\"content100note11sym\">\u00a0</a> <i>Matthew </i>18:21-35.</p>"

I have two questions that reach to my research.\n\nFirst, several responses to the Preview note the salience of virtues to particular settings, e.g., psychiatric care, epistemic communities, science. In like manner, Prof. Herdt\u2019s Preview raises questions for me about lawmaking and policymaking in international organizations, such as the UN Commission on International Trade Law, the International Monetary Fund or UN Security Council. I am pressed to consider whether there are distinctive virtues particularly salient to lawmakers and policymakers in these settings, whether state or non-state delegates or international civil servants within IOs, virtues that are conducive to flourishing and constructive legal order within and beyond states?

In like manner, Prof. Herdt\u2019s Preview raises questions for me about lawmaking and policymaking in international organizations, such as the UN Commission on International Trade Law, the International Monetary Fund or UN Security Council. I am pressed to consider whether there are distinctive virtues particularly salient to lawmakers and policymakers in these settings, whether state or non-state delegates or international civil servants within IOs, virtues that are conducive to flourishing and constructive legal order within and beyond states?

This suggests a kind of virtuous feedback loop: virtuous agents help shape virtuous institutions which in turn help shape virtuous character. Experience suggests this sometimes can be the case (such as in healthy families), but the shameful record of the institutional church with respect to sexual abuse, for example, gives serious pause for thought about how straightforward or common this phenomenon is.\n\nAnd when it comes to, say, the institutions of the criminal justice system, the issue becomes even more challenging.

We may speak euphemistically of \u201ccorrecting\u201d offenders and \u201crehabilitating\u201d their moral character, but evidence shows the opposite often takes place.

    "introText": "I enjoyed reading Prof. Herdt\u2019s preview of her forthcoming Theological Brief on the Virtues, and particularly appreciated the way she connects the virtues to human flourishing.

    "bodyText": "I enjoyed reading Prof. Herdt\u2019s preview of her forthcoming Theological Brief on the Virtues, and particularly appreciated the way she connects the virtues to human flourishing. In the full Brief, I would be interested in seeing some engagement by Prof. Herdt with the empirical evidence for the relationship between moral character and flourishing; one recent paper by our team at the Human Flourishing Program found that even the self-assessed \u201ccommitment to promoting the good in all circumstances\u201d is highly predictive of future flourishing in many domains, including social relationships, life satisfaction, and even physical health ( https://doi.org/10.1177%2F0890117120964083 ).\n\nI\u2019ll also mention two broad questions which I would be glad to see discussed in the full brief. First, Prof. Herdt notes that, \u201cThings do not always go well for virtuous people\u201d; I hope she\u2019ll defend this position against (or perhaps rather, clarify its relation to) the classic Stoic insistence that virtue is sufficient for happiness, a position more often pilloried than refuted. In The Morality of Happiness , for instance, Julia Annas helpfully shows how the Aristotelian alternative to Stoic self-sufficiency also yields apparent paradoxes, such as that the virtuous person can be made continuously happier by the addition of external goods.\n\nAnd second, I hope that Prof. Herdt will offer some discussion of how common the virtues are. This is a question which has generated a great deal of debate among contemporary psychologists and philosophers (under the heading of \u201csituationism\u201d), but much less so (so far as I can tell) among theological ethicists. This is unfortunate, because if the virtues are rare, that would have significant implications for their potential role in shaping the character of society as a whole.\n\nStrikingly, there seems to have been a virtual consensus among classical and medieval theorists that the virtues (and indeed the vices) are quite rare: Aristotle, for instance, insisted that \u201cthe many\u2026do not abstain from bad acts because of their baseness but through fear of punishment\u201d ( NE 1179b7\u201313).\u00a0(In Aristotle and the Virtues , Howard Curzer comments that, for Aristotle, \u201cthe category of \u2018the many\u2019 includes not only children, but also the majority of adults, for [in Aristotle\u2019s view] these adults are morally childish\u201d (333). And, as Thomas Osborne notes, \u201cFollowing Aristotle, Thomas [Aquinas] thinks although some agents are virtuous and others are vicious, there are many agents who are neither. Continent agents act well, but they think about what they should not do because their desires are disordered. Incontinent agents act poorly, but they are generally aware of what they should do\u201d ( Human Action in Thomas Aquinas, John Duns Scotus, and William of Ockham , 77, cf.

In the full Brief, I would be interested in seeing some engagement by Prof. Herdt with the empirical evidence for the relationship between moral character and flourishing; one recent paper by our team at the Human Flourishing Program found that even the self-assessed \u201ccommitment to promoting the good in all circumstances\u201d is highly predictive of future flourishing in many domains, including social relationships, life satisfaction, and even physical health (<a href=\"https://doi.org/10.1177%2F0890117120964083\">https://doi.org/10.1177%2F0890117120964083</a>).</p>\n<p>I\u2019ll also mention two broad questions which I would be glad to see discussed in the full brief. First, Prof. Herdt notes that, \u201cThings do not always go well for virtuous people\u201d; I hope she\u2019ll defend this position against (or perhaps rather, clarify its relation to) the classic Stoic insistence that virtue is sufficient for happiness, a position more often pilloried than refuted. In\u00a0<em>The Morality of Happiness</em>, for instance, Julia Annas helpfully shows how the Aristotelian alternative to Stoic self-sufficiency also yields apparent paradoxes, such as that the virtuous person can be made continuously happier by the addition of external goods.</p>\n<p>And second, I hope that Prof. Herdt will offer some discussion of how common the virtues are. This is a question which has generated a great deal of debate among contemporary psychologists and philosophers (under the heading of \u201csituationism\u201d), but much less so (so far as I can tell) among theological ethicists. This is unfortunate, because if the virtues are rare, that would have significant implications for their potential role in shaping the character of society as a whole.</p>\n<p>Strikingly, there seems to have been a virtual consensus among classical and medieval theorists that the virtues (and indeed the vices) are quite rare: Aristotle, for instance, insisted that \u201cthe many\u2026do not abstain from bad acts because of their baseness but through fear of punishment\u201d (<em>NE\u00a0</em>1179b7\u201313).\u00a0(In\u00a0<em>Aristotle and the Virtues</em>, Howard Curzer comments that, for Aristotle, \u201cthe category of \u2018the many\u2019 includes not only children, but also the majority of adults, for [in Aristotle\u2019s view] these adults are morally childish\u201d (333). And, as Thomas Osborne notes, \u201cFollowing Aristotle, Thomas [Aquinas] thinks although some agents are virtuous and others are vicious, there are many agents who are neither. Continent agents act well, but they think about what they should not do because their desires are disordered. Incontinent agents act poorly, but they are generally aware of what they should do\u201d (<em>Human Action in Thomas Aquinas, John Duns Scotus, and William of Ockham</em>, 77, cf.\u00a0<em>De malo</em>\u00a0q. 3, art. 9, ad 7).</p>"

    "bodyText": "The command of love which forms the centrepiece of Jesus\u2019 moral teaching (Mt. 22: 37-40 and parallels) was elicited by a rabbinic discussion that sought to identify a unifying interpretative principle for the requirements of the Torah as a whole. That love \u201cfulfils\u201d the law means four things: ( a ) The whole range of moral norms that give form to a godly life is implied in it: commands of the law, lists of virtues, warnings of temptations, detailed social responsibilities. Interpreted together in this way, they cease to threaten the ultimate tragedy of incompatible moral demands; ( b ) Yet the unification of the demands does not abolish essential differences. Asked about the \u201cfirst\u201d or \u201cgreatest\u201d command, Jesus proposed not one love-command but two, the distinction between the Creator and the created good still appearing clearly within the framework of love; ( c ) Law, therefore, despite the menacing appearance of its plural and prescriptive structure, satisfies the requirements of our moral nature when \u201cwritten on the heart\u201d (cf. 2 Cor. 3:3; Heb. 8:10); ( d ) So the love-command is the historical climax of the revelation of God\u2019s will, giving us the last word on the fulfilment of our existence.\n\nSuch an extended use of the term \u201clove\u201d confronts two alternative conceptual dangers. On the one hand, it may seem to leave love without definite content and critical force: if nothing falls outside the scope of the concept, nothing is unloving. Alternatively, one of the love\u2019s aspects may supplant the others, so that we understand our obligations too narrowly: if love is sensitivity, we imagine that everything is to be done with a display of emotion; if love is faithfulness, we become suspicious of independence and originality; if love is practical helpfulness, we undervalue attitudes that are not sufficiently energetic, and so on. The mistake is not to think that sensitivity, faithfulness and practical energy are expressions of love; it is to concentrate on one and ignore the others. We should not, then, expect a taut definition of love. Love is to be described at large, as an unfolding practical relation of the subject to its object, in which there are many moments, passive and active: admiration, desire, practical purpose, settled commitments, identification, etc. In this way the medieval tradition distinguished a variety of types of love\u2014desire, good-will, admiration, friendship etc.no\u2014not conceived as alternatives, but as moments of experience that succeed one another variously in the course of a life that gives and receives love.\n\nFormally expressed, the object of any love is \u201ca good\u201d; but that is broad enough to allow objects of different kinds. It is intelligible to say that we \u201clove\u201d qualities, experiences of sight and sound, states of existence, and so on, but we also love persons. Personal loves, given priority in Jesus\u2019 love-commands, are open to reciprocity and mutual communion. Marriage, uniquely mutual and enduring, can be seen as an ideal paradigm of identification in love, an image of the love between Christ and his followers (Eph. 5:25-30). But love has many forms, and friendship affords a more widely applicable matrix of love (Jn. 15:12-14). Three closer explorations may make this general picture clearer.\n\nAn influential early 20th century theory (Nygren, Barth) posed a stark alternative between Christian love ( agap\u0113 ) and natural love ( eros ), the one marked by self-giving and the other by self-seeking. In love we are either self-enclosed or outgoing, either exploiting or yielding. The reduction of love to these two wholly subjective attitudes excluded even such phenomena as desire and friendship. Though most accounts influenced by this theory have thought of \u201cagapic\u201d love as morally superior, the original conception was that no value-judgment could be made between these two; they simply demanded a radical choice. Behind that proposal lay the long philosophical history of \u201cthe will\u201d, which was first conceived, in the early middle ages, on the model of God\u2019s decision to create. Prior to any judgment of fact or value, the will was \u201cindifferent\u201d to objective good and evil. The mainstream philosophy of mind in the medieval and early-modern West embodied this conception in the theory of the two faculties of the mind, intellectual and voluntative. Love, classified under the will, was seen as subjective and arbitrary, and at this point disappeared from among the major topics of philosophy, leaving theology to make what sense of it it could.\n\nBut love must be thought of, also, as a way of knowing the world\u2014the highest way imaginable to human beings whose existence is always expressed in agency. And the implication of this is that truth, the essential criterion of knowledge, is also a criterion of love. But as a true knowledge of the world grasps the manifold differences that constitute its complex order, knowing each thing for what it is and not taking it for something else, so must a true love. When the church fathers spoke of an \u201cordered love\u201d they meant that love needed to be conformed to the order of reality. In Augustine\u2019s phrase, we love God \u201cas\u201d God, and the neighbour \u201cas\u201d neighbour, i.e. with an understanding of what \u201cgodhead\u201d and \u201cneighbourhood\u201d imply. As God is the condition of all being, so the love of God is the condition for truthful love of any created thing. Faithfulness to the grounding reality of the object is the key to the economy of differentiated action: in one case faithfulness to an agreement, responsiveness to contingencies in another, attention to natural relations in a third. To love business partners as business partners, students as students, children as children, patients as sick people, is why we need generalised practices and norms governing business, education, healthcare etc. An entrepreneur needs to understand how the accepted practices that govern competition in business serve the specific goods of employment and distribution of goods, but must also be aware that these do not exhaust the demands of love. There are demands that can only be grasped in terms of the particularities of a situation, as when a rival in some difficulty may need help. And as in the parable of the Samaritan, purely contingent encounters may impose duties of love. Failure to recognise the different character of our relations and of the demands they impose is a failure to love well.\n\nVarieties in love determine the variety of virtues: a majestic good evoking love in the form of humility, an imperilled good evoking love in the form of courage, a good postponed evoking love in the form of patience, etc. Love is not one virtue among others, patristic theologians taught, but a \u201cgolden chain\u201d that binds virtues together, or, as the scholastics said, the \u201cform\u201d of the virtues.

    "bodyHtml": "<p>The command of love which forms the centrepiece of Jesus\u2019 moral teaching (Mt. 22: 37-40 and parallels) was elicited by a rabbinic discussion that sought to identify a unifying interpretative principle for the requirements of the Torah as a whole. That love \u201cfulfils\u201d the law means four things: (<em>a</em>) The whole range of moral norms that give form to a godly life is implied in it: commands of the law, lists of virtues, warnings of temptations, detailed social responsibilities. Interpreted together in this way, they cease to threaten the ultimate tragedy of incompatible moral demands; (<em>b</em>) Yet the unification of the demands does not abolish essential differences. Asked about the \u201cfirst\u201d or \u201cgreatest\u201d command, Jesus proposed not one love-command but two, the distinction between the Creator and the created good still appearing clearly within the framework of love; (<em>c</em>) Law, therefore, despite the menacing appearance of its plural and prescriptive structure, satisfies the requirements of our moral nature when \u201cwritten on the heart\u201d (cf. 2 Cor. 3:3; Heb. 8:10); (<em>d</em>) So the love-command is the historical climax of the revelation of God\u2019s will, giving us the last word on the fulfilment of our existence.</p>\n<h2>The Breadth of Love</h2>\n<p>Such an extended use of the term \u201clove\u201d confronts two alternative conceptual dangers. On the one hand, it may seem to leave love without definite content and critical force: if nothing falls outside the scope of the concept, nothing is unloving. Alternatively, one of the love\u2019s aspects may supplant the others, so that we understand our obligations too narrowly: if love is sensitivity, we imagine that everything is to be done with a display of emotion; if love is faithfulness, we become suspicious of independence and originality; if love is practical helpfulness, we undervalue attitudes that are not sufficiently energetic, and so on. The mistake is not to think that sensitivity, faithfulness and practical energy are expressions of love; it is to concentrate on one and ignore the others. We should not, then, expect a taut definition of love. Love is to be described at large, as an unfolding practical relation of the subject to its object, in which there are many moments, passive and active: admiration, desire, practical purpose, settled commitments, identification, etc. In this way the medieval tradition distinguished a variety of types of love\u2014desire, good-will, admiration, friendship etc.no\u2014not conceived as alternatives, but as moments of experience that succeed one another variously in the course of a life that gives and receives love.</p>\n<p>Formally expressed, the object of any love is \u201ca good\u201d; but that is broad enough to allow objects of different kinds. It is intelligible to say that we \u201clove\u201d qualities, experiences of sight and sound, states of existence, and so on, but we also love persons. Personal loves, given priority in Jesus\u2019 love-commands, are open to reciprocity and mutual communion. Marriage, uniquely mutual and enduring, can be seen as an ideal paradigm of identification in love, an image of the love between Christ and his followers (Eph. 5:25-30). But love has many forms, and friendship affords a more widely applicable matrix of love (Jn. 15:12-14). Three closer explorations may make this general picture clearer.</p>\n<h3>Love conceived as Will</h3>\n<p>An influential early 20th century theory (Nygren, Barth) posed a stark alternative between Christian love (<em>agap\u0113</em>) and natural love (<em>eros</em>), the one marked by self-giving and the other by self-seeking. In love we are either self-enclosed or outgoing, either exploiting or yielding. The reduction of love to these two wholly subjective attitudes excluded even such phenomena as desire and friendship. Though most accounts influenced by this theory have thought of \u201cagapic\u201d love as morally superior, the original conception was that no value-judgment could be made between these two; they simply demanded a radical choice. Behind that proposal lay the long philosophical history of \u201cthe will\u201d, which was first conceived, in the early middle ages, on the model of God\u2019s decision to create. Prior to any judgment of fact or value, the will was \u201cindifferent\u201d to objective good and evil. The mainstream philosophy of mind in the medieval and early-modern West embodied this conception in the theory of the two faculties of the mind, intellectual and voluntative. Love, classified under the will, was seen as subjective and arbitrary, and at this point disappeared from among the major topics of philosophy, leaving theology to make what sense of it it could.</p>\n<h3>Love conceived as Knowledge</h3>\n<p>But love must be thought of, also, as a way of knowing the world\u2014the highest way imaginable to human beings whose existence is always expressed in agency. And the implication of this is that truth, the essential criterion of knowledge, is also a criterion of love. But as a true knowledge of the world grasps the manifold differences that constitute its complex order, knowing each thing for what it is and not taking it for something else, so must a true love. When the church fathers spoke of an \u201cordered love\u201d they meant that love needed to be conformed to the order of reality. In Augustine\u2019s phrase, we love God \u201cas\u201d<em> </em>God, and the neighbour \u201cas\u201d<em> </em>neighbour, <em>i.e. </em>with an understanding of what \u201cgodhead\u201d and \u201cneighbourhood\u201d imply. As God is the condition of all being, so the love of God is the condition for truthful love of any created thing. Faithfulness to the grounding reality of the object is the key to the economy of <em>differentiated</em> action: in one case faithfulness to an agreement, responsiveness to contingencies in another, attention to natural relations in a third. To love business partners <em>as </em>business partners, students <em>as </em>students, children <em>as</em> children, patients <em>as </em>sick people, is why we need generalised practices and norms governing business, education, healthcare etc. An entrepreneur needs to understand how the accepted practices that govern competition in business serve the specific goods of employment and distribution of goods, but must also be aware that these do not exhaust the demands of love. There are demands that can only be grasped in terms of the particularities of a situation, as when a rival in some difficulty may need help. And as in the parable of the Samaritan, purely contingent encounters may impose duties of love. Failure to recognise the different character of our relations and of the demands they impose is a failure to love well.</p>\n<h3>Love in the Form of the Virtues</h3>\n<p>Varieties in love determine the variety of virtues: a majestic good evoking love in the form of humility, an imperilled good evoking love in the form of courage, a good postponed evoking love in the form of patience, etc. Love is not one virtue among others, patristic theologians taught, but a \u201cgolden chain\u201d that binds virtues together, or, as the scholastics said, the \u201cform\u201d of the virtues. Virtues are governed by special norms: humility by the demand not to think too highly of ourselves, courage by the demand not to value our own safety above greater public goods. These special norms make different requirements, but all derive their obligatory force from the law of love. This lays upon us the task of interpreting the requirements well, making sure that they are transparent to love. The healthcare professional may need to conform to bureaucratic and procedural rules; but in dealing with sick patients these need also to be given a kindly face. There is such a thing as the wrong virtue at the wrong time\u2014a humility when courage is needed, or an efficiency when patience is needed. Habitual virtues can dictate automatic responses that narrow the range of moral perception, closing our eyes to other demands of love.</p>\n<h2>Love and Justice</h2>\n<p>A special challenge to the sovereignty of love is presented by the relation of love to justice, which<em> </em>does not follow the pattern of the other virtues. Between love and justice there can arise a tension. To explore and resolve it involves distinguishing two ways of speaking about justice outlined by Aristotle: as a virtue of acts of judgment, with its own special norms, and (more typically of the New Testament usage) as a general success in acting to serve the common good. There are high theological stakes in this discussion, which bears directly on divine forgiveness and the scandal of the cross.

This position has evolved in different directions, some of which are commonly grouped under the label of \u201cnaturalism\u201d. In general terms, naturalism affirms that to explain the world only \u201cnatural explanations\u201d count, that is, that no reference to divine wills and agents is needed. In a stronger (but quite common) sense, this means that what is real is that what can be scientifically explained. Causal explanation and mathematical calculation would thus set the limits of reality. Moreover, a corollary of naturalism is that neither love, nor any human appreciation of value or meaning legitimately belong to how things in the world really are.

To contribute to this dialogue, I would like to formulate two questions that point to central elements in such a justification:\n\nFirstly, Professor O\u2019Donovan seems to move from true knowledge to true love when he says that given that the former requires \u201cknowing each thing for what it is,\u201d thus the latter also must do. Thus, the priority is given here to the epistemic knowledge of particularities and to the attention to differences required in every form of true knowledge. This attention has been traditionally defined (even though this definition has been deeply criticized) as a relationship of correspondence ( adaequatio ) between what we believe or say about the world and the way the world is. But in what sense does love contribute to grasping the way things really are in the world? This is, how is it that love could count as an epistemic principle to evaluate our theories? In other words, the argument should move from true love to true knowledge.\n\nSecondly, it seems to me that as Professor O\u2019Donovan presents his claim that love is a way of knowing, there is a prior way of knowledge not directly related to love but presupposed by it. This prior way of knowing is defined as \u201cfaithfulness to the grounding reality of the object\u201d, which is necessary for loving God as \u201cGod\u201d, the neighbour as neighbour, etc. It would seem that knowing the difference between objects is the condition for appropriately loving them as they are, without confusion. Should not we rather say that only love allows us to establish such distinctions? That, is, that it is love that makes it possible to discover the \u201cgrounding reality\u201d of each object, not only in the sense that they all are created by God, but that something in their way of being as they are, something in their particularities and differences, requires love to be grasped?

Indeed, it has been forcefully argued by John Witte, as Nicholas Wolterstorff notes in his GFI Postscript on Justice and Rights, that rights emerge from deep within the Christian tradition.

In Christianity, the command to \u2018love your neighbours as yourselves\u2019 is rooted in the belief that all people are created in the image of God.\n\nCan human rights law promote love? Or does it merely promote justice? When love becomes a legal duty, does it change the nature of love? Consider equality law, which has developed over the years to protect individuals from discrimination on the grounds of race, colour, sex, disability, etc. Those who make the law may be motivated by love. Has the law changed the hearts to contribute to a more loving and compassionate society? Or does it matter so long as we simply enforce the objective and minimum standards of legally acceptable behaviour in the society?\n\nFor instance, disability discrimination law imposes the duty of reasonable accommodation for persons with disability to enable them to enjoy equal opportunities as able-bodied persons. However, stigma, discrimination and the perception of the disabled as burdens in the contexts of employment are still common. How can Christian employers and colleagues go beyond the requirements of the law, treating others with respect and acceptance, to truly be the \u2018light of the world\u2019 (Matthew 5:15)?

He does not particularly focus on romantic love, or love that finds its fulfilment in marriage; but of course so much of what he writes has application to intimate relationships and marital love.\n\nMarital love is of course, dependent both on agap\u0113 and eros, and by eros in this context, I am unequivocally referring to sexual desire. Eros is an important element of marital love. In all societies in which coupling occurs other than by parental arrangement, eros is a catalyst that brings people together, creating at least one of the conditions for agap\u0113 between women and men. Agap\u0113 does not come naturally to human beings. Eros is the fire that burns brightly, attracting people together. It helps to create the conditions for committed mundanity in the ordinary business of family life. There is no eros in cleaning the bathroom or supporting one\u2019s spouse when he or she is bedridden with a virus; but eros, while not indispensable, does provide a basis for that marital commitment that is for better for worse, for richer or for poorer, in sickness and in health.\n\nTill death us do part? As a family lawyer, I deal in disappointed love, situations where love does not last. As a society, we have adopted many turns of phrase, many euphemisms, many convenient explanations for why love might die. A new trend, perhaps most evident in the United States, is to celebrate breakups as a new stage of life in pursuit of self-fulfilment. [\u00a01\u00a0] Couples may announce their amicable separation, speaking in such positive language about it that one is left to wonder why on earth they have separated in the first place. [\u00a02\u00a0]\n\nSuch attempts at positivity may be admirable, but we should not be taken in. For the most part, a divorce, particularly when there are children, is accompanied by strong emotions of grief, anger and betrayal. Yes, there are couples who decide mutually that it is better for them to part ways, and they do so amicably. However, it is not typical. Usually there is a \u2018leaver\u2019 and a \u2018left\u2019. There is a betrayer and a betrayed. There is an abused and an abuser. In these circumstances, it is not surprising that people feel strong emotions.\n\nAbove all, and whatever the reasons for the break-up or the circumstances that provided its catalyst, divorce can involve profound disappointment. Disappointment in the other, to be sure; but also disappointment with God, and disappointment about your goals and expectations for what your life course will be during those happier times when planning a future together.\n\nDivorce is the recognition that there is no longer either agap\u0113 or eros in the relationship. So what is left? Often, just the very strong emotions that arise from the ashes \u2013 anger, even hatred; wishing the worst for the other person.\n\nFor some former couples, the level of conflict is so high that it is hard to see how they came together in the first place. One experienced family court judge in Australia would occasionally ask a witness to describe how he or she fell in love with the former partner. It was a way of gently reminding that person that there was once a strong basis for both agap\u0113 and eros.\n\nUnfortunately, divorce is all too often when agap\u0113 is displaced by its opposite. A disappointed or betrayed lover may no longer be remotely concerned with self-giving, or forgiveness, or compromise. The question now, asked in the name of \u2018justice\u2019, is how much I can get in the property settlement, or in spousal maintenance, or child support; or how little time I need to allow the other person to see the children.\n\nWhat then is the place of Christ\u2019s commandment to love one another after both agap\u0113 and eros have died? Is there a more or less Christian way to divorce? Does the Christian obligation to love extend beyond the time when a marital relationship is over?\n\nI suggest that in these circumstances, love survives as an obligation long after it has died as a feeling. Or perhaps more accurately, it survives as a series of obligations. First and foremost, it is an obligation to be concerned with the wellbeing of the other for the sake of the children. That requires each to practice at least enough forgiveness and self-control to ensure that the children are protected from the parents\u2019 conflicts and to avoid denigrating the other parent to the children. Even in the most painful divorces, some remnant of concern for the wellbeing and interests of the other may need to be rediscovered in order to chart a way for the future in which both of them are able to cooperate in parenting their children.\n\nSecondly, there is an obligation to address losses that result to one party from the role division within the relationship. Marriage has long-term consequences for people\u2019s lives financially. Often, an imbalance in the earning capacity of each of the parties at the end of the relationship reflects the consequences of the role division within that relationship, as one spouse, usually the woman, prioritises family responsibilities for a time over involvement in the workforce, while the other focuses on career. Fogarty J in the Australian case of Waters and Jurek [\u00a03\u00a0] explained:\n\nIn most marriages, there is a division of roles, duties and responsibilities between the parties. As part of their union, the parties choose to live in a way which will advance their interests - as individuals and as a partnership \u2026 Post-separation, the party who had assumed the less financially rewarded responsibilities of the marriage is at an immediate disadvantage. Yet that party often cannot simply turn to more financially rewarding activities. Often, opportunities to do so are no longer open, or, if they are, time is required before they can be accessed and acted upon.\u201d\n\nLove, then, towards someone for whom love has died, requires that the one who has built up greater income-earning capacity should not walk away, leaving the other with disproportionate financial detriments as a consequence of prioritising home and family.\n\nThird, there is an obligation to love the other sufficiently to maintain the peace of the Christian community. Divorce is not only the end of the marital relationship. Very often it divides church communities as well. It can be extraordinarily difficult for Christians who have been friends with both spouses to continue in relationship with both. Almost inevitably, there is pressure, overt or otherwise, to take sides, to sympathise with the position of one spouse against that of the other, or to be an empathetic listener to only one party. Love for a person for whom love, as a feeling, has been entirely lost, may require magnanimity in order not to promote division within the Christian family.\n\nJesus called on us to love one another. That call obviously includes, but is not limited to, a spouse and children. When love has died, we need to find a different kind of love, another way of relating. Divorce ends the marriage, but not the family; [\u00a04\u00a0] and long-term obligations, borne out of that relationship, call us to love even, and perhaps most of all, when it hurts.\n\n[\u00a01\u00a0] Lara Bazelon, \u2018Divorce Can Be an Act of Radical Self-Love\u2019 New York Times, September 30 th 2021.\n\n[\u00a02\u00a0] See e.g. Nikki DeBartolo & Benjamin Heldfond, Our Happy Divorce: How Ending Our Marriage Brought Us Closer Together (Mascot Books, 2019).\n\n[\u00a03\u00a0] [1995] FLC 92-635.\n\n[\u00a04\u00a0] P.

It was a way of gently reminding that person that there was once a strong basis for both agap\u0113 and eros.</p>\n<p>Unfortunately, divorce is all too often when agap\u0113 is displaced by its opposite. A disappointed or betrayed lover may no longer be remotely concerned with self-giving, or forgiveness, or compromise. The question now, asked in the name of \u2018justice\u2019, is how much I can get in the property settlement, or in spousal maintenance, or child support; or how little time I need to allow the other person to see the children.</p>\n<h2>Love One Another as I have Loved You</h2>\n<p>What then is the place of Christ\u2019s commandment to love one another after both agap\u0113 and eros have died? Is there a more or less Christian way to divorce? Does the Christian obligation to love extend beyond the time when a marital relationship is over?</p>\n<p>I suggest that in these circumstances, love survives as an obligation long after it has died as a feeling. Or perhaps more accurately, it survives as a series of obligations. First and foremost, it is an obligation to be concerned with the wellbeing of the other for the sake of the children. That requires each to practice at least enough forgiveness and self-control to ensure that the children are protected from the parents\u2019 conflicts and to avoid denigrating the other parent to the children. Even in the most painful divorces, some remnant of concern for the wellbeing and interests of the other may need to be rediscovered in order to chart a way for the future in which both of them are able to cooperate in parenting their children.</p>\n<p>Secondly, there is an obligation to address losses that result to one party from the role division within the relationship. Marriage has long-term consequences for people\u2019s lives financially. Often, an imbalance in the earning capacity of each of the parties at the end of the relationship reflects the consequences of the role division within that relationship, as one spouse, usually the woman, prioritises family responsibilities for a time over involvement in the workforce, while the other focuses on career. Fogarty J in the Australian case of <em>Waters and Jurek</em><a class=\"anchor\" id=\"content100note3anc\" name=\"content100note3anc\">\u00a0</a><a class=\"note\" href=\"#content100note3sym\">[\u00a03\u00a0]</a> explained:</p>\n<blockquote><p>In most marriages, there is a division of roles, duties and responsibilities between the parties. As part of their union, the parties choose to live in a way which will advance their interests - as individuals and as a partnership \u2026 Post-separation, the party who had assumed the less financially rewarded responsibilities of the marriage is at an immediate disadvantage. Yet that party often cannot simply turn to more financially rewarding activities. Often, opportunities to do so are no longer open, or, if they are, time is required before they can be accessed and acted upon.\u201d</p></blockquote>\n<p>In most marriages, there is a division of roles, duties and responsibilities between the parties.

Yet that party often cannot simply turn to more financially rewarding activities. Often, opportunities to do so are no longer open, or, if they are, time is required before they can be accessed and acted upon.\u201d</p>\n<p>Love, then, towards someone for whom love has died, requires that the one who has built up greater income-earning capacity should not walk away, leaving the other with disproportionate financial detriments as a consequence of prioritising home and family.</p>\n<p>Third, there is an obligation to love the other sufficiently to maintain the peace of the Christian community. Divorce is not only the end of the marital relationship. Very often it divides church communities as well. It can be extraordinarily difficult for Christians who have been friends with both spouses to continue in relationship with both. Almost inevitably, there is pressure, overt or otherwise, to take sides, to sympathise with the position of one spouse against that of the other, or to be an empathetic listener to only one party. Love for a person for whom love, as a feeling, has been entirely lost, may require magnanimity in order not to promote division within the Christian family.</p>\n<p>Jesus called on us to love one another. That call obviously includes, but is not limited to, a spouse and children. When love has died, we need to find a different kind of love, another way of relating. Divorce ends the marriage, but not the family;<a class=\"anchor\" id=\"content100note4anc\" name=\"content100note4anc\">\u00a0</a><a class=\"note\" href=\"#content100note4sym\">[\u00a04\u00a0]</a> and long-term obligations, borne out of that relationship, call us to love even, and perhaps most of all, when it hurts.</p>\n<h2 class=\"new_page\">Endnotes</h2>\n<p class=\"endnote\"><a class=\"note\" href=\"#content100note1anc\">[\u00a01\u00a0]</a><a class=\"anchor\" id=\"content100note1sym\" name=\"content100note1sym\">\u00a0</a> Lara Bazelon, \u2018Divorce Can Be an Act of Radical Self-Love\u2019 New York Times, September 30<sup>th</sup> 2021.</p>\n<p class=\"endnote\"><a class=\"note\" href=\"#content100note2anc\">[\u00a02\u00a0]</a><a class=\"anchor\" id=\"content100note2sym\" name=\"content100note2sym\">\u00a0</a> See e.g. Nikki DeBartolo &amp; Benjamin Heldfond, <em>Our Happy Divorce: How Ending Our Marriage Brought Us Closer Together </em>(Mascot Books, 2019).</p>\n<p class=\"endnote\"><a class=\"note\" href=\"#content100note3anc\">[\u00a03\u00a0]</a><a class=\"anchor\" id=\"content100note3sym\" name=\"content100note3sym\">\u00a0</a> [1995] FLC 92-635.</p>\n<p class=\"endnote\"><a class=\"note\" href=\"#content100note4anc\">[\u00a04\u00a0]</a><a class=\"anchor\" id=\"content100note4sym\" name=\"content100note4sym\">\u00a0</a> P.

More precisely, the position I put forward in the article is that whenever the expression \u201cHe/she loves . . .\u201d is employed, then \u201clove\u201d is used to indicate either \u201ca disposition toward desiring a perceived good or desiring union with it, either as an end itself or with it being a source of delight in itself\u201d (i.e., unitive love) or \u201ca disposition towards desiring good for a particular object for its own sake\u201d (i.e., contributory love).

Some of these measures are now already available (VanderWeele, 2023b) and we hope that this work will eventually result in insights into how to promote love within society.

I begin my own efforts to grapple with this enhanced vision by raising questions about ways the \u201clove-command\u201d may be discovered in every corner of the research university. I follow Professor O\u2019Donovan\u2019s (hereafter OOD) headings. Along the way I speculate about connections between manifestations of love and particular disciplines.\n\n1/ If love is the unifying principle for the Torah - ancient Judaic law \u2013 should it likewise be seen as the touchstone for Christian appraisals of and contributions to all law and lawmaking, whether judicial, legislative, or administrative? This would set a challenging agenda for legal scholars, interdisciplinary law and humanities scholars who work on law, and public policy specialists.\n\n2/ On love reaching \u201cthe whole range of moral norms,\u201d can we discern sharp enough cutting edges of love, or specifications of the ways love expresses itself as a master principle, so that we can both appraise law on the books and law in action (see 1/ above) but also observe its means and challenges in unifying levels of norms from international law to national and local formal laws? This again would provide a valuable conjunction of theology with those who study the behavior of law.\n\n3/ Where love reaches to being \u201cwritten on the heart,\u201d is this a place where the \u201cexterior\u201d forms of law (e.g., statutes, government regulations) enter the \u201cinterior\u201d of the self, such that law as a field engages with psychology, behavioral economics, and social work as fields where inner sentiments, preferences, and deficiencies connect to love\u2019s outward expressions and formulations?\n\n4/ In the statement that the \u201clove-command is the historical climax of the revelation of God\u2019s will,\u201d what is the referent and force of \u201chistorical\u201d here? At the historical moment of the first codification of God\u2019s commands, i.e., Sinai? At the moment of Jesus\u2019s earthly life? And are there subsequent historical moments (e.g., the abolition of the slave trade, giving women the vote) when we may observe new breakthroughs in human recognition of love\u2019s scope?\n\n5/ On love as sensitivity , may we ask about it being an emotional response to what? Other persons, animals, sunsets, the sounds of the surf, magnificent music and art? And what spectrum of emotions might be discovered in \u201clove as sensitivity\u201d? Is theology here capable of mutually informing the fine and performing arts, psychiatry and social work, helping professions, architecture, neuroscience, and psychology?\n\n6/ On love as faithfulness , insofar as life on the intellectual frontier has \u201coriginality\u201d as a hallmark, this juxtaposition with \u201cfaithfulness\u201d appears essential to our scholarly lives, but I would welcome more understanding of why it is \u201cfaithfulness\u201d (to what?) that could lead to suspicion. Is it faithfulness to the steady often hard slog\u2014endless hours in the lab or archives, years of fieldwork, painstaking ransacking of data\u2014that follows the start-up passion in a line of scholarship?\n\n7/ On love as practical helpfulness and undervaluing things \u201cnot sufficiently energetic,\u201d is this an implicit affirmation by Professor O\u2019Donovan that the application of love in practical ways (e.g., the helping professions, engineering, architecture, public health, public policy, applied sciences) should not eclipse love as it is manifest in expressive fields (e.g., the fine and performing arts, literature) or theoretical fields (e.g., pure mathematics, theoretical physics, logic, music theory, fundamental research in the sciences) or highly specialized fields (e.g., ethnomusicology, paleobiology, sociolinguistics)? Might there be a primary form of love that has a particular affinity with respective fields of inquiry?\n\n8/ When OOD speaks of love\u2019s \u201cmoments\u201d as \u201cpassive and active,\u201d is he pointing us to the moods of love\u2014sometimes on the front foot, sometimes on the back foot, in the terms of those of us who are lovers of cricket? Where might such moods arise in the scholarly life? Passive moods when we are receiving new ideas or findings at a faculty workshop or academic conference? Passive moods when we are imbibing seemingly endless new words or observations or data-points?\n\n9/ When OOD speaks of love\u2019s moments as \u201cadmiration, desire,\u201d I am reminded that in their GFI writings, Nicholas Wolterstorff and Jennifer Herdt (in her wonderful Postscript on The Virtues) both speak to passion in one\u2019s scholarship. In OOD\u2019s terms, does desire or passion get expressed as a form of eros in the sheer joy and excitement many of us feel in our research, teaching, writing, public education on topics where the Holy Spirit has quickened our beings? Or are passion, admiration, and desire rather different points on a spectrum of relationships with our work and scholarly colleagues, students, administrators?\n\n10/ When OOD speaks of love\u2019s \u201cmoments of experience, \u201d I was reminded of an inspiring course I took as an undergraduate in developmental psychology. Is OOD here offering a framework whereby we might prospectively or retrospectively conceive of the Christian walk in terms of a succession of different kinds of love to the fore, viz., that we might reproduce in our own lives something of the historical revelation of love\u2019s manifestations that he talks about above? And does this translate to the phases of my scholarly life\u2014a succession of different kinds of love for ideas or students or collaborators-as-friends or guiding funding into new realms of inquiry? Looking forward, the doctoral student or early career scholar can anticipate various ways of loving that punctuate the unfolding career. Looking back, the senior scholar can see the loves that brought a career to its later chapters.\n\n11/ When OOD says it is \u201cintelligible to \u2018love\u2019 qualities,\u201d is he implicitly or even explicitly asserting that love of my field, excitement in my discovery of a new concept or empirical finding or topic of inquiry may properly be seen theologically as an emanation of love?\n\n12/ When OOD points to friendship as a form of love, I reflect on its almost complete absence, in my experience, from the pulpit. Even less have I heard of its expression as \u201cpersonal love\u201d in the university or our collegial networks, collaborations, and the like. Of course, I have many friendships developed in scholarly societies, research and writing collaborations, co-teaching, but I would welcome other scholars\u2019 views on how it can be manifest as an ethical imperative in the academic life. For instance, is it collegial friendship that sustains us when we hit a brick wall in writing or confront negative findings or seem to have lost our creative impulses? Is the development of more fully expressed friendships a gift than can emerge from collegial collaborations, such as co-authorship or membership in scholarly societies?\n\n13/ In my earlier conversations with OOD on love, I understood that his expansive concept of \u201ceros\u201d goes far beyond the binary critiqued here or our unthinking reduction in common discourse of eros to sex. How does OOD see eros unfolding more expansively in the life of the mind, in the realms of discovery, integral to the research university? Does eros in OOD\u2019s expansive understanding reach to the passions that propel many of us in our research, teaching and writings? Is this to say in yet another way that passion alongside curiosity, faithfulness, and diligence are the often invisible filaments of love in our scholarship?\n\n14/ How does OOD differentiate between \u201ceros\u201d and \u201cdesire\u201d? Is the latter a subset of the former? Where does \u201cdesire\u201d fit in a University of Edinburgh or St. Andrews or Hong Kong or JN Nehru University?\n\n15/ Insofar as the discovery and search for truth have often been a raison d\u2019etre of the university, is OOD here elevating our scholarly work beyond reaching truth to exercising love or intensifying our love relationship with God?\n\n16/ On \u201cknowing each thing for what it is,\u201d might OOD be alluding to tensions among academic fields that result from reductionism, i.e., the effort to explain away one field\u2019s theory and methods by another, e.g., reducing law to economic preferences, belief to neurobiology, social institutions to psychological processes, myths to psychological needs, etc.? Drawing these cross-disciplinary struggles into a framework of love feels like a quite radical move. By knowing \u201ceach thing for what is is\u201d are we called both to celebrate the particular expertises of a given scholarly field as well as recognizing the need to see relations of knowledge about a particular thing with other things in adjacent fields, i.e., a complementarity that can produce flourishing in learning and life?\n\n17/ On love being \u201cconformed to the order of reality,\u201d and \u201cgrounding reality of the object\u201d seem to this social scientist to bespeak the value of empirical research. Talking of differentiation (\u201cdifferentiated action\u201d below) resonates with a student of Max Weber and much contemporary social science. Is OOD saying that every differentiated form of social relations\u2014business partners, professor-student relations, doctor-patient relationships\u2014will have a corresponding manifestation of love particular to that relationship? That manifestation of love will be misplaced if uncritically borrowed from another kind of relationship? If so, how do we elaborate this in the plethora of actions and relationships in our academic lives: teacher/student interactions, research/writing collaborations, author/referee relations, editor/author or grant writer/grant referee exchanges? Does our Christian presence in the university impel us to identify all these forms of \u201cdifferentiated action\u201d in the academy and to discern how love is properly to be exercised in each or has an affinity with each?\n\n18/ When OOD writes that \u201cfailure to recognize the different character of our relations\u201d might lead to a \u201cfailure to love well,\u201d is he calling implicitly for academics, in the first instance, to be much more analytic and self-reflective about the relationships essential to the academic life, and in the second instance to bring to the surface the appropriate variant of love appropriate to that relationship?\n\n19/ I am new to virtues-thinking both in theology and in my scholarship. Do I understand OOD here to be saying that each virtue has its own particular or governing norm which I am called to understand and then to apply to my work and scholarship? In addition, however, am I called also to revisit each virtue and ask where love might also infuse it or complement or modify or round out the particular norm that is dominant in courage or prudence among others?\n\n20/ When OOD speaks of the health professional getting beyond rules to \u201ca kindly face,\u201d would he generalize this example to propose that every helping professional, indeed every academic, must not be constricted in the understanding of their roles by defining it in ethically confined ways, i.e., that we should consider a potential love dimension to every academic role?\n\n21/ OOD closes with a tantalizing question: Could he provide examples in either direction, i.e., institutional practices bound absolutely by justice norms which are not relaxed by the imperative of love versus institutional practices modifying justice by the command of love?",

    "bodyText": "At the core of economic analysis is the idea that there are gains from trade between economic agents, such as individuals, businesses, states. The simplest formulation has two agents with different endowments of goods, who by trading with each other can attain bundles of goods that meet their \u2018needs\u2019 better than their initial bundles. The Edgeworth box analysis of elementary economics makes this point evident. It is \u2018rational\u2019 to trade in this way. But the gains are limited to finding partner agents who have goods that you desire, and are interested in goods you can offer. If I need a cleaner for my apartment, I need to find a cleaner who is seeking tutorials in economics\u2014the \u2018good\u2019 I am competent to deliver. The \u2018genius\u2019 of the market price system is that we no longer need to rely on such unlikely \u2018coincidence of wants\u2019. Economic agents can supply goods or services which are surplus to their own requirements, and use the resulting income to buy other goods or services that they need. The consequence of such transactions is that there is no need for direct connection between the supplier and the purchaser: I may pay my cleaner and establish a relationship with him, but I have no idea who supplies the cleaning materials that the cleaner uses. I may not even identify the retailer if I buy those materials on line. Economic transactions are generally characterised by anonymity. The purchasers of a good or service need to look to their own interests as caveat emptor ('let the buyer beware') applies.\n\nThis analysis is predicated on relatively benign behaviour by the agents [\u00a01\u00a0] . There is a long-held view that in some circumstances behaviour may be far from benign. For example, a monopolist seller or a monopsonistic buyer of a good may exploit their market power to \u2018rip off\u2019 the other parties to transactions. However, the most serious issues arise in the application of caveat emptor, in situations of asymmetric information between buyer and seller such that one or other of the parties has much fuller information about the potential trade than their counterpart. It may be impossible for a buyer to assess the quality of a good or service on offer, if this cannot be ascertained directly by inspection. Indeed, a moment\u2019s thought should convince us that this is probably true of most goods and services we purchase. Rational economic actors would be expected to take advantage of their private information.\n\nWhat might it mean to \u2018love neighbour\u2019 in such circumstances? O\u2019Donovan\u2019s Preview argues that love involves seeking the good of the other person. Whether the identified \u2018good\u2019 is right for the other is critical, which depends on the correctness (truth or untruth) of the definition of the good in their circumstances. The order of reality must shape love: if someone is starving then love will meet their need for food; if someone is grieving, then love will take the form of supporting and comforting them in their grief; if someone needs affirmation then love will seek to affirm their worth and encourage them. In other words, the form that a loving action will take should be, as far as possible, \u2018tailor made\u2019 to the situation of the recipient.\n\nIf this is correct then the \u2018every man for himself\u2019 nature of market transactions is not consistent with the love command. Instead, the seller should ask whether a particular transaction will contribute to the flourishing of the purchaser. Evidently in situations where the seller is not transparent about the quality of the product or service, the buyer may be fooled into making a purchase which is not in his or her own interests. The purchaser must also ask whether the transaction is conducive to the good of the supplier. Obvious examples are where a product has been manufactured under conditions that demean the workers, or grown under conditions that harm the environment. A more contentious example featured in the global financial crisis, where some major financial institutions were found to have sold financial products that they privately knew would fail and hence incur losses for those who bought them.\n\nBut it will not be easy to \u2018love neighbour\u2019 in market transactions where anonymity of the transactors applies. What then should a conscientious purchaser or seller do? One possibility is to express concerns about a whole group or class of people who are involved in the transactions. Examples include consumer boycotts of products or producers [\u00a02\u00a0] , or suppliers taking steps to prevent products being sold to people who are vulnerable in some way. An example of the latter would be products like alcoholic drinks that cannot be accessed by people under 18, or betting sites that limit number of on-line bets that a customer can place, with a view to preventing gambling addiction. Of course, such measures are more likely to be the result of regulation than the good will of the suppliers!\n\nMarket outcomes can, as is often noted, have profound effects on the overall distribution of income in a society. This is an outcome of the workings of the \u2018invisible hand\u2019 of the market economy, and it would be impossible to relate this to market participants who had failed to care for the welfare of the others with whom they are transacting. How might the injunction to love neighbour work out in this (very common) case? Dealing with the problem piece-meal through individual charity is unlikely to meet the needs, as individual charity will not be sufficiently systematic in reaching those in need. The answer might be to invoke the power of the political authorities to bring about some redistribution of income. The obvious example is the provision of welfare programmes in most advanced market economies to provide resources to the poor and disadvantaged by taxing the incomes and expenditures of those who have substantial incomes. Such programmes have grown markedly in the past hundred years, and now comprise a major component of government expenditure. This is far from straightforward in practice: provision for the poor may have unintended consequences such as removing incentives to work and creating welfare dependency.\n\nThe examples of the last two paragraphs have underlined the inability of individual actions to love neighbour effectively in a complex market economy. A further issue is how to identify the \u2018neighbour\u2019 whom one is to \u2018love\u2019. That surely must include those who are in proximate to us, including both the local community and those who are connected for example by family relationship. But what about those known to us who are living in desperate conditions in places far distant from where we live? The spread of global internet connections and immediate news reporting brings their plight directly to us, and it would be unacceptably callous not to show compassion simply because they are so far away, and so not act to relieve their suffering. But we will need to rely on relief agencies to channel our aid. A contentious issue for some is whether governments should also be involved in overseas aid. The case for such involvement is that governments may more adequately and effectively channel the desire of the citizens to reach out to those in need around the globe. Exactly how such aid is to be delivered to those in need is much debated: the concern is that official aid may be diverted to their own interests by the governments or elites of recipient countries.\n\n[\u00a02\u00a0] How to respond to such cases is often far from straightforward. For example, boycotting goods produced by child labour in a poor country may have the effect of making them and their families destitute, and making it impossible for the parents to pay for even elementary schooling for their children.",
    "bodyHtml": "<p>At the core of economic analysis is the idea that there are gains from trade between economic agents, such as individuals, businesses, states. The simplest formulation has two agents with different endowments of goods, who by trading with each other can attain bundles of goods that meet their \u2018needs\u2019 better than their initial bundles. The Edgeworth box analysis of elementary economics makes this point evident. It is \u2018rational\u2019 to trade in this way. But the gains are limited to finding partner agents who have goods that you desire, and are interested in goods you can offer. If I need a cleaner for my apartment, I need to find a cleaner who is seeking tutorials in economics\u2014the \u2018good\u2019 I am competent to deliver. The \u2018genius\u2019 of the market price system is that we no longer need to rely on such unlikely \u2018coincidence of wants\u2019. Economic agents can supply goods or services which are surplus to their own requirements, and use the resulting income to buy other goods or services that they need. The consequence of such transactions is that there is no need for direct connection between the supplier and the purchaser: I may pay my cleaner and establish a relationship with him, but I have no idea who supplies the cleaning materials that the cleaner uses. I may not even identify the retailer if I buy those materials on line. Economic transactions are generally characterised by anonymity. The purchasers of a good or service need to look to their own interests as <em>caveat emptor </em>('let the buyer beware') applies.</p>\n<p>This analysis is predicated on relatively benign behaviour by the agents<a class=\"anchor\" id=\"content100note1anc\" name=\"content100note1anc\">\u00a0</a><a class=\"note\" href=\"#content100note1sym\">[\u00a01\u00a0]</a>. There is a long-held view that in some circumstances behaviour may be far from benign. For example, a monopolist seller or a monopsonistic buyer of a good may exploit their market power to \u2018rip off\u2019 the other parties to transactions. However, the most serious issues arise in the application of caveat emptor, in situations of asymmetric information between buyer and seller such that one or other of the parties has much fuller information about the potential trade than their counterpart. It may be impossible for a buyer to assess the quality of a good or service on offer, if this cannot be ascertained directly by inspection. Indeed, a moment\u2019s thought should convince us that this is probably true of most goods and services we purchase. Rational economic actors would be expected to take advantage of their private information.</p>\n<h2>Who is My Neighbour in a Market Economy?</h2>\n<p>What might it mean to \u2018love neighbour\u2019 in such circumstances? O\u2019Donovan\u2019s Preview argues that love involves seeking the good of the other person. Whether the identified \u2018good\u2019 is right for the other is critical, which depends on the correctness (truth or untruth) of the definition of the good in their circumstances. The order of reality must shape love: if someone is starving then love will meet their need for food; if someone is grieving, then love will take the form of supporting and comforting them in their grief; if someone needs affirmation then love will seek to affirm their worth and encourage them. In other words, the form that a loving action will take should be, as far as possible, \u2018tailor made\u2019 to the situation of the recipient.</p>\n<h2>How Sellers and Buyers can Express the Love Command</h2>\n<p>If this is correct then the \u2018every man for himself\u2019 nature of market transactions is not consistent with the love command. Instead, the seller should ask whether a particular transaction will contribute to the flourishing of the purchaser. Evidently in situations where the seller is not transparent about the quality of the product or service, the buyer may be fooled into making a purchase which is not in his or her own interests. The purchaser must also ask whether the transaction is conducive to the good of the supplier. Obvious examples are where a product has been manufactured under conditions that demean the workers, or grown under conditions that harm the environment. A more contentious example featured in the global financial crisis, where some major financial institutions were found to have sold financial products that they privately knew would fail and hence incur losses for those who bought them.</p>\n<h2>Overcoming Anonymity in Market Transactions</h2>\n<p>But it will not be easy to \u2018love neighbour\u2019 in market transactions where anonymity of the transactors applies. What then should a conscientious purchaser or seller do? One possibility is to express concerns about a whole group or class of people who are involved in the transactions. Examples include consumer boycotts of products or producers<a class=\"anchor\" id=\"content100note2anc\" name=\"content100note2anc\">\u00a0</a><a class=\"note\" href=\"#content100note2sym\">[\u00a02\u00a0]</a>, or suppliers taking steps to prevent products being sold to people who are vulnerable in some way. An example of the latter would be products like alcoholic drinks that cannot be accessed by people under 18, or betting sites that limit number of on-line bets that a customer can place, with a view to preventing gambling addiction. Of course, such measures are more likely to be the result of regulation than the good will of the suppliers!</p>\n<h2>Systemic Solutions to the Love Command in Markets</h2>\n<p>Market outcomes can, as is often noted, have profound effects on the overall distribution of income in a society. This is an outcome of the workings of the \u2018invisible hand\u2019 of the market economy, and it would be impossible to relate this to market participants who had failed to care for the welfare of the others with whom they are transacting. How might the injunction to love neighbour work out in this (very common) case? Dealing with the problem piece-meal through individual charity is unlikely to meet the needs, as individual charity will not be sufficiently systematic in reaching those in need. The answer might be to invoke the power of the political authorities to bring about some redistribution of income. The obvious example is the provision of welfare programmes in most advanced market economies to provide resources to the poor and disadvantaged by taxing the incomes and expenditures of those who have substantial incomes. Such programmes have grown markedly in the past hundred years, and now comprise a major component of government expenditure. This is far from straightforward in practice: provision for the poor may have unintended consequences such as removing incentives to work and creating welfare dependency.</p>\n<h2>Loving \u2018Neighbours\u2019 in a Complex World Economy</h2>\n<p>The examples of the last two paragraphs have underlined the inability of individual actions to love neighbour effectively in a complex market economy. A further issue is how to identify the \u2018neighbour\u2019 whom one is to \u2018love\u2019. That surely must include those who are in proximate to us, including both the local community and those who are connected for example by family relationship. But what about those known to us who are living in desperate conditions in places far distant from where we live? The spread of global internet connections and immediate news reporting brings their plight directly to us, and it would be unacceptably callous not to show compassion simply because they are so far away, and so not act to relieve their suffering. But we will need to rely on relief agencies to channel our aid. A contentious issue for some is whether governments should also be involved in overseas aid.

The OT understanding of love is itself cross-cultural in its multilayered ancient Near-Eastern contexts, and the NT understanding of love is inherently both cross-cultural in its highly intersected Greco-Roman and Jewish contexts; and cross-disciplinary seen in the NT\u2019s myriad ways of interacting with the OT.

I think OPL is correct, that discerning the four tenets in \u201cThe Love-Command as a \u2018Fulfilment\u2019\u201d will be foundational to our moral reasoning about love. Nevertheless, I don\u2019t think we can assume that all peoples have shared understandings of meanings attached to the English word \u201clove,\u201d or indeed of various biblical and theological understandings, and even more of love as it is understood outside the biblical canon or Christian traditions, such as the Confucian <em>ren </em>in the <em>Analects</em> or the Platonic <em>ero\u0304s </em>in the <em>Symposium</em>. For instance, the same Greek word, <em>agap</em>e\u0304, is used in the Bible with very different meanings. In 2 Samuel 13:1, 4 (Greek Old Testament) <em>agap</em>e\u0304 is used (translating the Hebrew word <em>ahav</em>) to describe Ammon\u2019s love for his half-sister Tamar whom he raped. In John 3:19 <em>agap</em>e\u0304 is used to describe \u201cpeople [who] love darkness rather than light.\u201d In John 3:35 <em>agap</em>e\u0304 is used to describe \u201cthe Father [who] loved the Son.\u201d Linguistic, historical, and cultural <em>contexts</em> reveal surprisingly diverse meanings of even a single Greek word for love.</p>\n<p>OPL alludes to the \u201cstark alternating\u201d of <em>agap</em>e\u0304 and <em>ero\u0304s</em> in Anders Nygren\u2019s understanding.

Students would tell me that they loved philosophy, loved English literature, whatever, but were nonetheless seriously considering going into law, medicine, or business. What did I think? They looked unhappy. I asked them why they were considering going into law, medicine, or business when it was philosophy or English literature that they loved. Their answer was always the same: their parents were forcing this on them. That\u2019s where the money is. So together we probed their relationship to their parents. Yes, their parents might be unhappy for a time if they did not go into a career that yielded them lots of money. But was pleasing their parents worth being unhappy for a lifetime?\n\nThird, is it worthwhile doing what you are proposing doing? On occasion, students would tell me that they were considering doing something that they would clearly be good at, and that they would love, but that seemed, to me, at least, to serve no worthwhile purpose.

If justice has to do with treating people in a manner that corresponds to their irreducible dignity and treatment of others, and if mercy refers to extending kindness and grace to people irrespective of what they deserve, one could argue that acts of justice are sometimes violations of the virtue of mercy, and vice versa. This question crops up repeatedly in the work I do: whether with Ukrainian theologians who refuse to share the sacraments with their Russian occupiers, or in relation to victims of persistent abuse who sometimes need to be encouraged not to reconcile with their abusers These seem to be instances in which the dictates of justice generally speaking, and the priority of mercy upon the vulnerable, render appropriate the withholding of mercy to the victimizer.

In other words, might we say that when the Ukrainian pastor withholds the sacraments from a Russian occupier, he is not withholding love from the soldier in favor of justice, but rather he is exercising love by rendering a truthful witness of judgment against the occupier, thereby calling him to repent for his violent injustice and seek the restoration of relationship with his Ukrainian neighbor and fellow Christian? Such an expression of judgment functions as a loving action toward the soldier, insofar as it aims to bring the soldier back into right relationship with God and neighbor. Likewise, the same action would be loving a different fashion toward occupied Ukrainians, truthfully vindicating them as righteous victims who can look to the Lord for rescue. And, in future moments of the Russian soldier\u2019s biography, if he repents of his injustice and is restored to God and neighbor, he can again receive love in the form of (eventual) mercy, forgiveness, and reconciliation.

    "bodyText": "Jesus famously taught (Matthew 22: 37\u201340 and parallels) that the first command of the law was Deuteronomy 6:4, \u201cYou shall love Yhwh your God with all your heart and mind and soul and strength\u201d and the second Leviticus 19:18, \u201cYou shall love your neighbour as yourself\u201d. All obligations, moral and religious, were included in these. That was Jesus\u2019 chief (but not sole) contribution to a discussion among early rabbis, concerned to help proselytes daunted by the intricacies of Torah-commentary, about how to interpret the six hundred and thirteen distinct commands (as they were numbered) as a coherent moral law. A life joined up by law required a joined-up law; God has one will, and demands one obedience. How to describe that obedience? Jesus\u2019 answer to the question implied four things.\n\nOn love \u201cthe law and the prophets hang\u201d, which is to say, they derive their intelligibility from it. Not the law only, but prophecy, too, spoke with divine authority, and so must be understood consistently with Torah. Each form in which the Scriptures gave moral direction \u2013 legal prescriptions, lists of virtues, warnings of danger, description of social responsibilities, narratives of obedience and disobedience \u2013 was to be read as an elaboration of how the agent was oriented in love to its creator and its fellow-creature. Though comprised of two prescriptions, the love-command is essentially one: it directs us as creatures towards God, and as fellow-creatures towards each other. But love is not the same in either case, for God and neighbour are not equal claimants. The neighbour presents us with a reflection of God\u2019s claim, so that it is really God who claims our love in two ways, directly and indirectly, as our Father and as our neighbour\u2019s Father. As the Johannine Epistle explains it, the \u2018brother\u2019 is the visible focus of love for the invisible God; in loving \u2018one another\u2019 we \u2018know\u2019 God by participating in his love for us all (1 John 3:11\u201318; 4:7\u201321).\n\nThe consistency of the demand for love does not iron out the variety among the commands. Neighbour-love is not uniform. As expounded in Leviticus 19, it is a relation to \u201cthe poor and the stranger\u201d who glean the fields, to property-owners vulnerable to theft, to hired servants who depend on a daily wage, to those with impaired faculties who need a safe public space, to business-partners depending on agreements, to litigants who want impartial courts. Many different claims are comprised in the single duty of neighbour-love. If we then add Jesus\u2019 command of love for the enemy , the variety is even more striking. Love is sympathy, love is objectivity, love is restraint, love is energetic action. These differences must be attended to if love is to be practical.\n\nLaw-as-love fulfils our moral nature. It is commanded, but we \u201cdelight in\u201d its commands (Psalm 112:1). In general law does not elicit delight, but ambivalence. It seems opaque and alien, contradicting our spontaneous desires (Romans 7:22f); as a powerless \u201cletter\u201d it lacks intelligibility; as an inflexible \u201ccondemnation\u201d it lacks sympathy. But interpreted by love it promises new and more effective initiatives of action. There is a law we are free to fulfil, which the apostle calls \u201cthe law of Christ\u201d (Galatians 6:2); it is written on the heart (2 Corinthians 3:3), no longer opaque, since the love of God has been poured into our hearts by the Holy Spirit (Romans 5:5).\n\nLaw-as-love is the fulfilment of a history of moral development. \u201cChrist is the end of the law\u201d, we are told (Romans 10:4), and law, like a prophetic sign, looked forward to him. The command of love is both \u201cnew\u201d and \u201cold\u201d, rooted in the first obscure fumblings of the human race to live in keeping with the laws of the universe, but shedding new light on them, since \u201cthe darkness is passing away and the true light shines\u201d (1 John 2:7f).\n\nThere have been many systems of law, and the Torah that Jesus interpreted by love is not identical with any law that governs us today. Can we justifiably take his summary as applicable not only to that one ancient text, but to national, institutional or professional laws and regulations that we are subject to? We can, if we see law as a living and constant presence in society, developing as historical situations change, not only the work of legislators but including customary practices, institutions, moral expectations which shape the life of any civilised community.\n\nLaw in all these aspects requires the interpretative direction of the love-command. It is not a question of love\u2019s replacing law in its many forms, but of its teaching us its true intentions. If we suppose that love and law are contradictory and mutually exclusive, we imagine that love overrides or defeats law. This idea was given a radical turn in the \u201csituationism\u201d of the mid-twentieth century, which argued that since every decision must be governed by love, ordinary moral norms could do no more than generalise, with a certain heuristic value for new situations, forms that love has taken in the past, but may or may not take in any new instance. A more conservative version of the position, making the same mistake, suggests that law must govern our conduct most of the time, but in \u201cborderline situations\u201d, where ordinary rules reach the limit of their capacity, love takes over. In both versions it is assumed that love and law point in contrary directions. But Jesus conceived that the direction given by law itself is under the direction of love.\n\nAs law\u2019s interpreter, love has normative force. Some accounts of Jesus\u2019 words allow them only an explanatory role: love is the best description of law-governed action, the motive for it, but it does not give concrete guidance. But if love does not guide, it cannot interpret guidance, and it can guide sufficiently only when it is brought under a higher-order principle that gives it coherence. To observe law requires thoughtful understanding of its purposes, for law contains a multiplicity of demands that may generate dilemmas. The supremacy of love thus secures practical reason against the existential threat of irreconcilable moral demands.\n\n\u201cLove\u201d is a wide-ranging term, and that can seem alarming for the clarity of practical reason. If we place love at the head of the commands, is everything we want to do commanded? Do we have sufficiently clear criteria for action? But Jesus\u2019 twofold love-command does not command everything, not even every possible love. There are loves for intermediate objects, which may or may not serve love for God and neighbour, and there are misdirected loves, corrupted by habit, fear, resentment or ignorance. Love for God and neighbour is criterion for judging those loves. Yet it is true that it covers a wide range of possible forms of action, and we should not try to narrow that range. Simply as a working definition let us suggest that love is an affective and directive attention to a good. This excludes many affective states: repulsions from evil, moods that affect us without producing action, isolated spontaneous acts that give no direction to our lives. But it still allows for the variations of love as it unfolds in passive and active moments of experience: admiration, desire, practical purpose, settled commitments, identification, etc.\n\nThe life of the lover contains many states of mind: agitation and calm, volition and recognition, instinct and reflection, contemplation and action, decision and habit, self-consciousness and self-abandon, enjoyment and detachment. I speak of these states as \u201cmoments\u201d of love rather than \u201ctypes\u201d or \u201ckinds\u201d, which could too easily suggest alternatives. Love is an extended event of human life, unfolding and developing in a sequence of its moments, which is how it gives shape to a life lived as a whole. The moralist\u2019s temptation is always to fix on one moment, and declare it to be the only \u201creal\u201d love \u2013 perhaps loyalty, or sensitive feeling, or practical helpfulness, or sacrifice. But this ignores the sheer breadth of love\u2019s range, which is why poetry and fiction have often been more successful in teaching us about love than philosophy. There is truth, of course, in the famous claim that \u201clove is not love which alters when it alteration finds\u201d [\u00a01\u00a0] , but it was persistence, not immobility, that the poet meant to praise. Love endures, not statically, but by renewing itself from memories and habits that sustain it and enable it to find new forms and expressions. There may be good reasons to isolate distinct moments for special attention or commendation. When we are told that \u201cgreater love has no man than this, that one lay down his life for his friends\u201d, we are shown a moment of outstanding moral significance. Yet even the moment of sacrifice arises within the context of a friendship, and what kind of \u201cfriendship\u201d would it be that was only ever sacrifice, never mutual enjoyment?\n\nOur working definition stressed the combination of \u201caffection\u201d and \u201cdirection\u201d. Love gives affectionate direction to action; it fills us with something we feel and steers us to something we may do . We cannot be commanded simply to feel, but because the feeling of love is made concrete in action, we can be commanded to love. Though we recognise love first by feeling, it is already a readiness for action. But not only of the busy and energetic sort. Attentive acts, such as listening, learning and wondering, are action, too; in love these have a certain priority over the busy and energetic acts, as the story of Mary and Martha illustrates. Practical reason has both reflective and deliberative phases, attending to the good that can be admired, attending to the good that can be performed.\n\nThere are many types of good: experiences of sight and sound, states of existence, objective things and persons, qualities of action. We may \u201clove\u201d many different things: our food, playing tennis, those close to us, works of art, the horizons of our spiritual aspiration, all that shares in the created good that God has made. Aesthetic perception is shaped by love of beauty, theoretical enquiry by love of reason. More generally, there is the love of wisdom, in which we seek intelligent participation in a common life, and this is the foundation for all developed forms of work. To love, we must learn of the generic goods, of \u201cqualities\u201d. Yet the love-command makes God and neighbour the supreme object of love. We may extend our definition: love for God and neighbour is an affective and directive attention to the good of persons: God as divine person, the neighbour as \u201clike ourselves\u201d, possessing personal agency and self-determination.\n\nPersonality is singular, not generic. To love a person it is not enough to have a liking for a kind of person (wise, affectionate, glamorous, energetic etc.), nor is it enough to be in a kind of relation with somebody (\u201ca\u201d marriage, \u201ca\u201d friendship, \u201ca\u201d good working-relationship, etc.). Personal love involves unique historical experience of God\u2019s goodness through and in that other person: this encounter with this person is a unique opening for me . Personal loves are open to reciprocity and mutual communion, as other loves are not. They have their forms and types \u2013 especially marriage, uniquely mutual and enduring, treated as an image of the communion of Christ and his followers (Ephesians 5:25\u201330), and friendship, also a central model for that same relation (John 15:12\u201314). But the full meaning of any personal relation is seen only as the form is filled with a particular content; we may want to be married or to make friends, but only marriage- to-X, and friendship- with-Y, will show us the goods that marriage and friendship really contain. Forms of beauty and wisdom, too, attract love, but are not where love finally comes to rest. \u201cWisdom is justified by all her children\u201d, we are told (Luke 7:35), which is to say, in persons who embody it. To love, we must learn to recognise personal singularity. Those who love the beauty of great drawing or fine music will learn to know someone whose personality appears through that art, Michelangelo, say, or Bach. Yet the singular does not leave its qualities behind. It would be nonsense to claim to love Bach not for his music but for himself. (Even Anna Magdalena Bach, who could love Bach \u201cfor himself\u201d more than we can, must have been glad she had married a musician!) To know him, we must grasp him as the central personal subject to which his exceptional musical powers belong, in whom they inhere. Jesus himself, inviting his disciples\u2019 love, presents himself in the person of Wisdom: \u201cTake my yoke upon you, and learn of me!\u201d (Matthew 11:29) To be in love with someone is to be affected both by who the person is and what. One cannot love without admiring, and so becoming in some respect wiser. But in love the \u201cwhat\u201d becomes unsubstitutably centred upon the \u201cwho\u201d.\n\nThe account we have given so far has to confront the objections of a view popular in the twentieth century: that there are only two types of love, and they are radically opposed.\n\nAnders Nygren, with whom this thesis was prominently associated, called the two loves by Greek names, agap\u0113 and er\u014ds, the first identified as a love focussed on the other, the second as a love centred on the self. The theory was based on a philological curiosity: the word standardly used for \u201clove\u201d in the Greek of the New Testament was a rarity in classical and Hellenistic Greek, agap\u0113, and this suggested to him that the writers of the New Testament knew that they were speaking of something so qualitatively different that the standard words for love were unserviceable to them. [\u00a02\u00a0] So filling the word agap\u0113 with the full moral conceptuality of love in the New Testament, and er\u014ds with what he imagined to be a Platonic ethic of self-realisation, he interpreted the one as self-giving and self-sacrifice, the other as self-centred, a nexus of desire, self-interest and acquisition. The two were essentially opposed, which means, though he hesitated to say so, morally opposed, as good to evil.\n\nNygren\u2019s idealised agap\u0113 is a prime instance of the mistake of canonising one moment of love and discarding the others. The love he commends to us is a love that cannot accept any kind of prior involvement of the self with the other, which would mean that its pure other-directedness would be compromised by self-love. From which it followed that it could not allow the retention of old love with settled affection. It is directed to the strange, the new and the alien, in which we find no recollection of ourselves. Dividing love into the two opposed dispositions, self-affirming and self-denying, enclosed and outgoing, exploitative and self-giving, Nygren\u2019s theory leaves no place for the extension of love through life, for a developing history of the self with the other, for the variety of moments and moods and contexts. And because the difference between agap\u0113 and er\u014ds is wholly a question of the orientation of the will, it has no place either for the qualification of love by knowledge. But love is, in fact, not solely a subjective disposition; it is a relation in feeling and knowledge between two subjects who are objects of love to one another. It must be judged in part by the truthfulness with which each grasps the reality of the other. Nygren imagined his idealised agap\u0113 as effectively creating a new world out of nothing, \u201cconferring value\u201d on its object, indifferent to existing goods \u2013 in fact, re-enacting the very deed of creation itself.\n\nHere Plato\u2019s ideal of er\u014ds did better than Nygren gave it credit for. He described er\u014ds specifically as the love of beauty, and imagined two stages by which beauty elicited it, \u201csupply\u201d and \u201cwant\u201d. First it presented something to wonder at, the moral importance of which lay in its revelatory power, and then it evoked a need, not simply to \u201cpossess\u201d the object, but to be productive under its influence. Er\u014ds was a moment of new beginning , a love of wisdom encountering its object for the first time, still asking questions that later stages of love might answer. It was the birth of enquiry, the moment of \u201cfascination\u201d: the mathematician conceives a problem, the reader is swept up in a web of poetic sound and meaning, the artist envisages a play of light and shade and form. Such moments of discovery, though they are specialised, are doors opening onto the beauty of wisdom as a whole, promising a kind of universal knowledge at the end of the pursuit. Personal loves differ from intellectual loves, in that they involve personal histories lived in freedom, and yet the same pattern of fascination can be seen in their initial moments. The beloved opens to the lover a view on the universe, which may even, as Dante held, lead to a vision of its Creator.\n\nNygren\u2019s er\u014ds turned Plato\u2019s experience of beauty inside out, seeing it as entirely self-enclosed. The roots of this lay in the Enlightenment, which had made self-love the principle of practical motivation: \u201cSelf-love, the spring of motion, acts the soul\u201d [\u00a03\u00a0] When superimposed on the older Christian understanding of self-enclosure as radical sin, this idea of self-love as a mechanical trigger produced the general modern suspicion of desire, still evident in Nygren\u2019s idea of er\u014ds as desire, self-interest and acquisition. In fact desire is no more self-concerned than any other state of feeling, for all feeling involves self-consciousness as well as the consciousness of an object. Neither is all self-consciousness acquisitive. There is a moral self-consciousness about what is good to do and to be, which in English we call \u201cconscience\u201d , and this is supportive of the concern we owe our neighbour.\n\nThe Christian tradition speaks of \u201cself-love\u201d with deliberate paradox. On the one hand, it is a true self-interest in the love of the neighbour; on the other hand, it is a false self-interest that treats the neighbour as a competitor for goods. This paradox goes back to Jesus\u2019 own teaching, when, under the shadow of the cross, he gave the warning that to gain one\u2019s life one must lose it (Mark 8:35 and parallels). The moral care we owe ourselves must embrace conscious self-loss; effective activity involves giving the resources of our life away. Loss is not an end in itself, but a necessary means to a life of greater effect. The same pattern applies to the more ordinary ways in which we serve one another. By giving ourselves in cooperative action, we prepare for a greater giving-away that will be required of us in death; yet death is not the horizon towards which we live, but the fuller life offered us beyond death. The paradox of self-love reflects a paradox of the self, which we can appear two quite different lights. There is a restricted self and an open self, a self we identify with our physical life, its comfort and its security, and a self we identify with a call to become something more than we are. True self-love is love of the true self, a self still to be fully realised in response to God\u2019s call, rejoicing in realities that give new form and purpose to its presence in the world. It is a reflective responsibility for ourselves before God, an answer to his demand that we should seek his kingdom and its justice.\n\nWe have come to an important conclusion. Love seeks to develop itself in knowledge. Truth, the criterion of knowledge, is also the criterion of love. Where there is truth, there may be falsehood, too, and love can fail by being false, not only by being weak. When St. Paul opposes love and knowledge (1 Corinthians 8:1) he employs a distinctive word, gn\u014dsis, to represent a false knowledge, a knowledge that \u201cpuffs up\u201d, contrasted with a love that \u201cbuilds up\u201d, a fascination with superficial and immediate phenomena that cuts us off from loving contact with the world God has given. But this windy knowledge is accompanied by an equally insubstantial love, \u201clove of the world\u201d, as St. John describes it, consisting in \u201cthe lust of the flesh, the lust of the eyes and the pride of life\u201d (1 John 2:15\u201316). Correspondingly, the stable love that ensures permanence allows a sober and affectionate grasp of reality. Those for whom specialised knowledge constitutes their sphere of work thus face a challenging question: how may they love that one aspect of the world which they know very well, while focussing their love finally upon God and their neighbours?\n\nTo which the first answer must be that they receive their work as a vocation , summoned to pay this close attention to this aspect of the world by the one who created and loves the world in all its aspects. On this we need say only that to love one\u2019s work, whatever it may be, one must love it for an end that can truly justify it. In understanding work as a vocation from God, that end is kept in view. The satisfaction we take in doing it well is a joy in having it to offer God, and also an anticipation of the joy of more unrestricted knowledge, the knowledge of the Creator himself.\n\nA second answer follows: loving the good of their work for God\u2019s sake, they seek to appreciate the ordering of goods that God has given. We call a special field of knowledge a \u201cbranch\u201d, appealing to the image of an ordered relation such as we see in organisms. The special good we know must be set in relation to the plenitude of all goods. Among these some are more fundamental, others less so, and it is always a question whether the goods we have come to love and know may restrict our view of more fundamental goods which God calls us to love and know. The idea of an \u201corder of love\u201d goes back to the early patristic era. Augustine developed it at length: inanimate things are loved \u201cfor the sake of animate things\u201d; creatures are loved \"for the sake of God\"; God alone is loved \"for his own sake\". Which was not meant to be understood as a ranking of preferences, as though one might choose between God and his creatures, nor as an ordering of means to ends, as though one might value creatures solely for their utility value. It was a reflective appreciation of each in its true relation to the others, a true knowledge of \u201cGod\u2019s world\u201d rather than only of things in the world, a love of God \u201cas\u201d God, of neighbour \u201cas\u201d neighbour, with an understanding what \u201cgodhead\u201d and \u201cneighbourhood\u201d imply.\n\nThe Temptations of Plural Fields of Knowledge Specialised professional knowledge has a plural and fragmentary character, shaped by the variety of independent enquiries. This poses no difficulty in principle; just as there are many people in God\u2019s world, and we can love only those whom space, time and opportunity put within our reach, so there are many things to know, and no one of us can know them all. It does, however, pose a temptation. Distinct enquiries create separate and distinct communities of enquiry, fenced in by invisible walls that distinguish those who are part of the enquiry from those who are not, held together by a solidarity of exclusive mutual esteem and sometimes bristling with defensive fortifications. Since the renaissance the work of knowledge has been known for its eristic character. The competitive spirit views specialist knowledge as a kind of property that confers power; in the present age, under pressure of cooperation with industry, the idea of intellectual property has assumed a major legal importance. There ought to be among us a deep sense that our knowledge is neither our own property nor our colleagues\u2019. Our knowledge is subject to the question the apostle puts to all our powers: \u201cWhat have you that you did not receive?\u201d (1 Corinthians 4:7)\n\nWith these personal temptations we must notice the temptations of the institutional settings. The \u201cuniversity\u201d, conceived in the faith that a plurality of studies conducted together possessed a value that none could have on its own, gives way to the \u201cmultiversity\u201d, where forms of learning are marketed in competition with each other. Plurality is competition, and the value of any field of study is supposed to lie simply in its power to market itself. The university thus becomes a mirror of the prevailing concerns of society, rather than a resource to inform and correct them.\n\nEstablished Knowledge If such moral dangers exist, arising from the tendency to entrench knowledge in doctrine and routine practices and closed professional communities, we can understand them as indicating an imbalance in love. Love, as we have said, is both old and new; there is a familiar love and an adventurous love, and the two must balance each other and build on each other. The love of knowledge is both old and new: a delight in learning what we did not know and a delight in retaining and affirming what we have learned. There is no reason to undervalue established forms of knowledge. No study can do without its basis of rationally agreed descriptions, and if we are to love people and things \u201cas\u201d what they are, we need to start with some prior understanding of what they are. Yet to love them is to be open to new communications about and with them. Within the practice of knowledge there must be a dynamic tension between consolidation and expansion, theoretical closure and discovery. The danger lies in finalising closures that can only be provisional. The same principle holds for professional activities. To treat patients \u201cas\u201d patients and students \u201cas\u201d students, healthcare practitioners and teachers need received frames of reference and accepted norms of practice. But these cannot exhaust the demands that loving knowledge of patients and students may make upon them. Many decisions lie beyond the scope of professional guidance, and professional practice itself needs interpretation by love. The love the Samaritan brought to the wounded man on the road was something over and above the professional competences of the priest and Levite (Luke 10:25\u201337). Or to take a more trivial example: the teacher faced with the tedious routine of grading examination scripts can justify strictness, consistency and efficiency as professionally correct, all on the basis of a love which considers the needs of students as a class, the needs of the institution, the standards of academic life, etc. But the teacher may also detect \u2013 one time in a hundred \u2013 a small and unexpected achievement hidden by a generally unsatisfactory performance, and love may insist on taking the costly detour to recognise it.\n\nCommunication These considerations remind us that a pursuit of knowledge is open to new development in more than one way. There can be new discoveries of thought and observation that challenge old paradigms, but there can also be new openings for the communication of knowledge. A special place in the economy of knowledge is held by studies which go beyond the default scientific model of explanatory theorising to recognising communications \u2013 historical studies especially, since historical distance is by far the most radical of all obstacles in the way of communicating human experience. No contemporary voice can speak to us about our own humanity in the way that voices from the past can. These studies largely, though not exclusively, turn around the art of intelligent reading, for it is writing brings within our range communications that time has put at a distance, and that is why writing is one key to what it means to be \u201ccivilised\u201d. But all fields of study may offer opportunities for receiving and giving new communications; and since it does not fall to many to be at the forefront of new discoveries, communication is perhaps the most important way in which our engagement with knowledge is kept pressing forward. Perhaps, it is the most important way anyway, since it brings the love of knowledge into immediate connection with the love of persons.\n\nAnd so we add a third answer to our question. Love of knowledge must reaffirm the centrality of education , broadly construed, in which our knowledge is given to the service of others. Education is the transmission of knowledge in all its aspects, factual, theoretical and practical, and is usually distinguished from research, on the one hand, and from training on the other. But these distinctions are only relative. In the end there must be no pursuit of knowledge that does not aim at communication, and correspondingly no communication that does not hope to strengthen others to live well, not simply to perform certain tasks. Every \u201cuseful\u201d field of instruction \u2013 agriculture, medicine, art, economics \u2013 trains students for tasks of one kind or another; but they may also look beyond the tasks to educate for the life in which those tasks have their place. We may find ourselves in circumstances where our training, strictly understood, cannot help us; but we shall never be in a position where that is true of our education.\n\nBut to educate for life is to educate in ethics . To dramatise the point: those with whose education we are concerned are at a point of decision, a parting of the ways between a life lived fruitfully to God\u2019s glory and a life wasted in mistakes and false directions. No education can deliver them from facing that decision, but it can provide resources for making it rightly. To educate ethically is not merely a matter of encouraging students to to expand their imaginations of good waiting to be done and supplying them with factual knowledge to do it. It is to help them overcome the gap between fact and imagination, to learn how idealistic Utopias may be brought to yield practical purposes, how factual information may be probed for opportunities of freedom. In other words, it teaches them to stop thinking of the world either as putty on which they can imprint their own designs, or as a granite wall on which they can survive only by spreadeagling themselves against it. Good disciplines of reflection and deliberation are learned as one sifts the merits of goals, absolutely and in relation to existing possibilities, and reassess possibilities ambitiously, in the light of goals.\n\nThe plural branches of love that follow the branches of knowledge shed useful light on how and why we speak of \u201cvirtue\u201d and \u201cthe virtues\u201d in Christian ethics. [\u00a04\u00a0] Virtue is a Hellenistic term, a rare visitor to the New Testament, but Jewish teachers in the Hellenistic world used \u201cvirtue\u201d (in the singular) to mark the convergence of law and wisdom in the Scriptures. Sometimes, too, they composed rhetorical lists of virtues and vices, and in this the New Testament followed them, and though it does not speak of \u201cvirtues\u201d and \u201cvices\u201d in that context, commentators have usually seen no reason not to do so. The lists are exploratory and varied, each presenting its own perspective on the development or decay of moral life. [\u00a05\u00a0] They bring home to us that the moral phenomena they describe are both plural and fluid. Love is the unifying factor; virtue-lists typically begin with it (Galatians 5:22f.; Philippians 1:9\u201311; Revelation 2:19) or end with it (2 Peter 1:5\u20137; Colossians 2:12\u201314). It is the \u201cbond of perfection\u201d, and it is the \u201cgreatest\u201d in that triad of virtues that \u201cendure\u201d, faith, hope and love (1 Corinthians 13:13). The fathers insisted that love was not just one virtue among others. It was the \u201cartificer\u201d and \u201cpreserver\u201d of virtue, John Chrysostom wrote, the \u201cgolden chain\u201d that bound them together. The scholastics spoke of love as the \u201cform\u201d of the virtues, meaning, as St. Thomas explained, that as virtues direct acts to their end, so love directs virtues to their end.\n\nVirtues and vices are phenomena we observe, patterns of behaviour that arouse admiration and abhorrence as we see them in others, and with less clarity see them in ourselves. Virtues and vices are not principles of deliberation, specific counsels that we are guided by in deciding what to do. Rather, they display the variety of possibilities in the moral life. In this way the plurality of the virtues corresponds to the plurality of the fields of knowledge: the variety and richness of creation allows a variety of kinds of experience, and so a variety of acquired forms of love for God and neighbour. Yet since admiration and abhorrence create a desire to imitate and avoid, the opposition of virtues and vices form a kind of framework for our fields of deliberation, and we may derive principles of action from them, especially the more general principles that give longer-term direction to our lives.\n\nVirtues are dispositions specially determined by special situations: courage by the imminence of danger, humility by others\u2019 achievements and merits, patience by undertakings that are long in coming to fruition, etc. They suggest special norms to govern those situations: humility teaches us not to think too highly of ourselves, courage not to value safety above greater public goods, and so on. We can acquire special virtues from acting frequently in typical situations, but precisely because there are many types of situation and many different moral requirements, no one virtue can have a final obligatory force. Each is demanded as the situation indicates a specific good that we may love: a majestic good evoking love as humility, an imperilled good evoking love as courage, a deferred good evoking love as patience, etc. This lays on us the perpetual task of interpreting the situations we face and discerning the objects of love they present. All virtues are specifications of love. What cannot be love, cannot be the exercise of a virtue. (Uriah Heep was not, as he claimed, \u201chumble\u201d, but merely insinuating and manipulative.)\n\nYet virtue can be misdirected, as love can. We can display the wrong virtue at the wrong time: humility when courage is needed, efficiency when patience is needed. Deeply habitual virtues can narrow our moral perception to see only what we are used to seeing, and the understanding which any one virtue supplies can never be all the practical wisdom we need, for the field of action is irreducibly plural. As in a social crisis no one expert can determine a course of action alone \u2013 how can an epidemiologist judge the psychological and economic implications of a lockdown? \u2013 so in the course of any human life no one virtue is all that is demanded. Scholarship has its distinctive virtues, patience high among them, but a scholar\u2019s life needs non-scholarly virtues, too \u2013 and not least, when asked to chair a meeting, decisiveness! To discern the special wisdom needed by any situation we require a further principle of discernment, and for this we must turn to love.\n\nJustice may often be spoken of as a virtue, too: love operating within the special field of action that defends or establishes social order. Yet from its earliest philosophical reflections justice has seemed to stand rather apart from the other virtues. Plato, to whom we owe the idea of four \u201ccardinal virtues\u201d, saw justice as the organising virtue that kept prudence, courage and temperance in their place; Aristotle distinguished two kinds of justice, \u201cgeneral\u201d and \u201cspecial\u201d, of which the latter governed social transactions of distribution and compensation, while general justice involved the exercise of all the other virtues in a social context. For both these thinkers justice was differentiated by a kind of universality, which put it in a position analogous to that of love in Jesus\u2019s teaching. In the New Testament the difference of justice is even more marked. Justice is primarily an attribute of God, designating the self-consistency of all that he wills and does in the world, his \u201cjudgments\u201d; only secondarily is it an attribute of human acts, and that not in respect of their intentions, but of their actual conformity to God\u2019s judgments. To be dikaios, as the New Testament understands it, is to be an object of a favourable judgment \u2013 primarily divine judgment and sometimes, consequently, human. Justice marks the point at which the drama of love in command, virtue and practice reaches its end and is pronounced on. If love must be the first word on our moral tasks, \u201cjustice\u201d must be the last, the horizon on which love is proven, a universal moral goal which is the \u201cfruit\u201d or \u201ccrown\u201d of a life lived in love. [\u00a06\u00a0]\n\nSo as love seeks knowledge, so love seeks justice. Knowledge and justice are both modalities of the truth love seeks: on the one hand a truth joyfully affirmed, on the other a truth embodied practically in social order. In justice \u201cyour neighbour\u201d is \u201cas yourself\u201d, not only in the way you feel about him, or even act towards him, but in full public recognition. Moral virtues may be exercised in secret, but justice only in public, and love\u2019s goal is to express itself in public reality. And as we said that the love of knowledge needs to be ordered to an end in the full knowledge of God, so we must say that love of practical knowledge needs an end in the justice of God\u2019s kingdom.\n\nWith justice, as with knowledge, there is a danger of finalising the provisional. The justice we want is always more than the justice we can achieve. The parallel between knowledge and justice applies here, too: our own partial judgments stand in relation to the justice God will bring about as our fragmentary knowledge stands to the fulness of the revelation of God. The resources human judgment can call upon are limited, sufficient at best for the small scale, where we may be able to describe a case, if not completely, yet with some measure of adequacy, and do something to set it right. To describe and correct all the wrongs of history is beyond us. How, for instance, could we ever give an adequate account of, and make sufficient amends for, such a large-scale historical offence as colonial slavery? In resorting too lightly and hastily to judgment, we run the risk of adding new layers to the tale of wrongs. Summum ius, summa iniuria , said the classical proverb; to which Jesus added the counsel, \u201cJudge not, that you be not judged\u201d (Matthew 7:1).\n\nYet while being reserved, we should not be sceptical about the judgments we may be given to do. They are limited to their time and place and relative to the immediate need. They scoop up the water of justice from a flowing river, as it were in cupped hands, to quench an urgent thirst. They are always provisional, never the last word but following the direction of love and waiting on its fulfilment. And yet they can be real and effective anticipations of God\u2019s justice. There is a true historical record of judgments reached and performed, which witness to God\u2019s work in the past and his purposes for the future.\n\nTwo examples in the past of how Christian hope has yielded judgments that have taught the world something new about God\u2019s purposes may be sufficient to suggest others.\n\nThe first is international law. Believing that even \u201csovereign\u201d governments were subject to the rule and law of God, even the earliest Christian thinkers sought to articulate the form of a \u201claw of nations\u201d that could reflect and correspond to God\u2019s law. The law of war, anciently understood as part of the \u201claw of nature\u201d, they interpreted as an implication of the law of love. To understand why the conduct of war had to be subject to forms and regulations, belligerents must weigh the duties and restraints of love that even the consciousness of a just cause could not excuse them from. Contemporary international law owes many of the categories and assumptions to Christian reasoning.\n\nThe second example is punishment. Construed according to its ancient definition as malum passionis pro malo actionis, \u201csuffering inflicted in respect of wrong done\u201d, it forms an integral part of ordered political life, as we know it, upholding the authority of law. But punishment does not have to be in any given form, and it has been a Christian political hope to shape punishment as a witness to the forgiveness of sins extended to all offenders, eliminating pointless inflictions that served no social end and especially by restraining the use of the death penalty. The claims of penal justice are important, but cannot be absolute. They have always to serve the actual needs of society and the conditions of political practicality, and an ideal of penal justice that cannot be made to do this is of no service to love.\n\nAbsolute justice there is none in this world \u2013 or the next, for when \u201cmercy triumphs over judgment\u201d (James 3:10), that is a truth not only about our own acts of judgment but about history as a whole. The last word in history, as the prophetic vision of John of Patmos saw it, is the \u201ccity of peace\u201d, where God dwells in communion with mankind for \u201cthe healing of the nations\u201d. There is justice, an order governed by love. The next-to-last word of judgment must have its place until then, yet always looking forward to the last word, overcoming of the bitterness of war and the shame of guilt.\n\nWe began from love as the interpretation of the law: on the one hand specific patterns of practical knowledge in need of the purpose of love to make them morally intelligible, on the other, love as the primary obligation, demanding expression in specific patterns of practical knowledge. From this, in conclusion, we may draw two warnings.\n\nIt is a warning, in the first place, against abstract norms of knowledge and action . Those whose business it is to find and share knowledge must recognise that merely to know is not to know. To know what we know, we must know it in the service of love. Which does not mean that knowledge is squeezed into a utilitarian straitjacket, or its value for its own sake denied. For to love knowledge as a blessing to mankind is to love it for what it is: a dimension of life itself, a ground of common enjoyment, a purchase on reality which permits action, fellowship and the praise of God. Merely t o know how to act, similarly, is not to know how to act. For effective agency needs more than norms; it needs an appreciable and worthwhile end given to it to pursue.\n\nIt is a warning, secondly, against an impractical idea of love that is confined to attitude and feelings, and does not form a practical direction for action. Love is more than a general benevolent will, resigning the questions of how to act to a practical reason that can function independently of it. A love that is alive and shapes life seeks to discern goods that are given us to do. If we say that love is a \u201cmotive\u201d for all knowledge and all action, we shall not be wrong; but we must not understand \u201cmotive\u201d too restrictively, simply as an impulse that initiates. Love is to be the end of our knowing and acting, not only the beginning of it. The proximate end of our knowledge is to know in love, and the proximate end of our action is to establish justice in love, in each case re-shaping and renewing the knowledge and action that we had before. But their final end is to know as we have been known, in God\u2019s compassionate understanding, and to act as we have been acted upon, in God\u2019s persistent grace.\n\nThat is why love is not simply a virtue we may learn to practice for ourselves. The love of God must be \u201cpoured into our hearts by the Holy Spirit that is given us\u201d (Romans 5:5).\n\n[\u00a01\u00a0] William Shakespeare, Sonnet 116.\n\n[\u00a02\u00a0] The true reason for the use of agap\u0113 in the New Testament was probably not philosophical, but simply an idiom of Hellenistic Jewish Greek. In the Septuagint, which influenced them, agap\u0101n translated the Hebrew \u0101hab, the most general verb for \u201clove\u201d. There were other common words for love in ancient Greek as well as these two. As well as eros, Plato and Aristotle made much of philia \u2013 \u201cfriendship\u201d, though the English word fails to convey its breadth. C.S. Lewis 1963, whose The Four Loves, written in conscious reaction against the dualist thesis, did a service to the debate by widening the range further by recalling storg\u0113, commonly used of close familial and social bonds. Yet the discussion of love does not, in the end, depend on how many ancient Greek words for love there were. Preachers who would never otherwise comment on the Greek text of the New Testament still like to pull out what they were once taught about the \u201cspecial significance\u201d of agap\u0113 \u2013 which perhaps is the greatest disservice Nygren rendered to theology!\n\n[\u00a03\u00a0] Alexander Pope, Essay on Man 2.59.\n\n[\u00a04\u00a0] This topic, extensively discussed in an earlier GFI Brief by Jennifer Herdt (https://globalfacultyinitiative.net/content_item/389), is merely touched on here, to highlight the implications of the sovereignty of love-command and to raise the question of justice.\n\n[\u00a05\u00a0] If three or more items constitute a list, we can count eight lists of vices and perhaps twenty-five lists of virtues in the New Testament. But such observations are subject to the general rule that the more something is counted, the less it is understood.\n\n[\u00a06\u00a0] To give some honesty to this over-compressed summary of how justice is spoken of in the New Testament two philological warnings are needed: (i) Modern English makes a distinction where New Testament Greek does not, between \u201cjustice\u201d and \u201crighteousness\u201d \u2013 both translating dikaiosyn\u0113 . Roughly, English \u201cjustice\u201d corresponds to Aristotle\u2019s \u201cspecial justice\u201d, while \u201crighteousness\u201d corresponds to his \u201cgeneral justice\u201d. (An older English usage favoured \u201cequity\u201d for general justice.) Translators import this distinction back into English translations of the Bible, and may have persuasive reasons for doing so, but in asking how the New Testament speaks of dikaiosyn\u0113 and its cognates, we should not prejudge the matter. (ii) Greek makes a distinction where English does not, using a different root for the act of \u201cjudgment\u201d, which is krisis. But the two terms remain closely connected, because Greek translators of the Hebrew Scriptures employed both roots to translate the Hebrew, \u0161pt, which is both \u201cjustice\u201d and \u201cjudgment\u201d.\n\nBarth, Karl. 1958. \u201cThe Holy Spirit and Christian Love\u201d.

    "bodyHtml": "<p>Jesus famously taught (Matthew 22: 37\u201340 and parallels) that the first command of the law was Deuteronomy 6:4, \u201cYou shall love Yhwh your God with all your heart and mind and soul and strength\u201d and the second Leviticus 19:18, \u201cYou shall love your neighbour as yourself\u201d. All obligations, moral and religious, were included in these. That was Jesus\u2019 chief (but not sole) contribution to a discussion among early rabbis, concerned to help proselytes daunted by the intricacies of Torah-commentary, about how to interpret the six hundred and thirteen distinct commands (as they were numbered) as a coherent moral law. A life joined up by law required a joined-up law; God has one will, and demands one obedience. How to describe that obedience? Jesus\u2019 answer to the question implied four things.</p>\n<h3>Love Orients all Moral Direction in Scripture</h3>\n<p>On love \u201cthe law and the prophets hang\u201d, which is to say, they derive their intelligibility from it. Not the law only, but prophecy, too, spoke with divine authority, and so must be understood consistently with Torah. Each form in which the Scriptures gave moral direction \u2013 legal prescriptions, lists of virtues, warnings of danger, description of social responsibilities, narratives of obedience and disobedience \u2013 was to be read as an elaboration of how the agent was oriented in love to its creator and its fellow-creature. Though comprised of two prescriptions, the love-command is essentially one: it directs us as creatures towards God, and as fellow-creatures towards each other. But love is not the same in either case, for God and neighbour are not equal claimants. The neighbour presents us with a reflection of God\u2019s claim, so that it is really God who claims our love in two ways, directly and indirectly, as our Father and as our neighbour\u2019s Father. As the Johannine Epistle explains it, the \u2018brother\u2019 is the <em>visible</em> focus of love for the <em>invisible</em> God; in loving \u2018one another\u2019 we \u2018know\u2019 God by participating in his love for us all (1 John 3:11\u201318; 4:7\u201321).</p>\n<h3>A Variety of Neighbours</h3>\n<p>The consistency of the demand for love does not iron out the variety among the commands. Neighbour-love is not uniform. As expounded in Leviticus 19, it is a relation to \u201cthe poor and the stranger\u201d who glean the fields, to property-owners vulnerable to theft, to hired servants who depend on a daily wage, to those with impaired faculties who need a safe public space, to business-partners depending on agreements, to litigants who want impartial courts. Many different claims are comprised in the single duty of neighbour-love. If we then add Jesus\u2019 command of love for the <em>enemy</em>, the variety is even more striking. Love is sympathy, love is objectivity, love is restraint, love is energetic action. These differences must be attended to if love is to be practical.</p>\n<h3>Love Commands and Delights</h3>\n<p>Law-as-love fulfils our moral nature. It is commanded, but we \u201cdelight in\u201d its commands (Psalm 112:1). In general law does not elicit delight, but ambivalence. It seems opaque and alien, contradicting our spontaneous desires (Romans 7:22f); as a powerless \u201cletter\u201d it lacks intelligibility; as an inflexible \u201ccondemnation\u201d it lacks sympathy. But interpreted by love it promises new and more effective initiatives of action. There is a law we are free to fulfil, which the apostle calls \u201cthe law of Christ\u201d (Galatians 6:2); it is written on the heart (2 Corinthians 3:3), no longer opaque, since the love of God has been poured into our hearts by the Holy Spirit (Romans 5:5).</p>\n<h3>Love Fulfils Moral History</h3>\n<p>Law-as-love is the fulfilment of a history of moral development. \u201cChrist is the end of the law\u201d, we are told (Romans 10:4), and law, like a prophetic sign, looked forward to him. The command of love is both \u201cnew\u201d and \u201cold\u201d, rooted in the first obscure fumblings of the human race to live in keeping with the laws of the universe, but shedding new light on them, since \u201cthe darkness is passing away and the true light shines\u201d (1 John 2:7f).</p>\n<h2>2. How Love Interprets Law</h2>\n<p>There have been many systems of law, and the Torah that Jesus interpreted by love is not identical with any law that governs us today. Can we justifiably take his summary as applicable not only to that one ancient text, but to national, institutional or professional laws and regulations that we are subject to? We can, if we see law as a living and constant presence in society, developing as historical situations change, not only the work of legislators but including customary practices, institutions, moral expectations which shape the life of any civilised community.</p>\n<p>Law in all these aspects requires the interpretative direction of the love-command. It is not a question of love\u2019s replacing law in its many forms, but of its teaching us its true intentions. If we suppose that love and law are contradictory and mutually exclusive, we imagine that love overrides or defeats law. This idea was given a radical turn in the \u201csituationism\u201d of the mid-twentieth century, which argued that since every decision must be governed by love, ordinary moral norms could do no more than generalise, with a certain heuristic value for new situations, forms that love has taken in the past, but may or may not take in any new instance. A more conservative version of the position, making the same mistake, suggests that law must govern our conduct most of the time, but in \u201cborderline situations\u201d, where ordinary rules reach the limit of their capacity, love takes over. In both versions it is assumed that love and law point in contrary directions. But Jesus conceived that the direction given by law itself is under the direction of love.</p>\n<p>As law\u2019s interpreter, love has normative<em> </em>force. Some accounts of Jesus\u2019 words allow them only an explanatory role: love is the best description<em> </em>of law-governed action, the motive for it, but it does not give concrete guidance. But if love does not guide, it cannot interpret guidance, and it can guide sufficiently only when it is brought under a higher-order principle that gives it coherence. To observe law requires thoughtful understanding of its purposes, for law contains a multiplicity of demands that may generate dilemmas. The supremacy of love thus secures practical reason against the existential threat of irreconcilable moral demands.</p>\n<h2>3. The Breadth of Love</h2>\n<p>\u201cLove\u201d is a wide-ranging term, and that can seem alarming for the clarity of practical reason. If we place love at the head of the commands, is everything we want to do commanded? Do we have sufficiently clear criteria for action? But Jesus\u2019 twofold love-command does not command everything, not even every possible love. There are loves for intermediate objects, which may or may not serve love for God and neighbour, and there are misdirected loves, corrupted by habit, fear, resentment or ignorance. Love for God and neighbour is criterion for judging those loves. Yet it is true that it covers a wide range of possible forms of action, and we should not try to narrow that range. Simply as a working definition let us suggest that love is<em> </em>an <em>affective and directive attention to a good. </em>This excludes many affective states: repulsions from evil, moods that affect us without producing action, isolated spontaneous acts that give no direction to our lives. But it still allows for the variations of love as it unfolds in passive and active moments of experience: admiration, desire, practical purpose, settled commitments, identification, etc.</p>\n<h3>Types and Moments</h3>\n<p>The life of the lover contains many states of mind: agitation and calm, volition and recognition, instinct and reflection, contemplation and action, decision and habit, self-consciousness and self-abandon, enjoyment and detachment. I speak of these states as \u201cmoments\u201d of love rather than \u201ctypes\u201d or \u201ckinds\u201d, which could too easily suggest alternatives. Love is an extended event of human life, unfolding and developing in a sequence of its moments, which is how it gives shape to a life lived as a whole. The moralist\u2019s temptation is always to fix on <em>one </em>moment, and declare it to be the only \u201creal\u201d love \u2013 perhaps loyalty, or sensitive feeling, or practical helpfulness, or sacrifice. But this ignores the sheer breadth of love\u2019s range, which is why poetry and fiction have often been more successful in teaching us about love than philosophy. There is truth, of course, in the famous claim that \u201clove is not love which alters when it alteration finds\u201d<a class=\"anchor\" id=\"content100note1anc\" name=\"content100note1anc\">\u00a0</a><a class=\"note\" href=\"#content100note1sym\">[\u00a01\u00a0]</a>, but it was persistence, not immobility, that the poet meant to praise. Love endures, not statically, but by renewing itself from memories and habits that sustain it and enable it to find new forms and expressions. There may be good reasons to isolate distinct moments for special attention or commendation. When we are told that \u201cgreater love has no man than this, that one lay down his life for his friends\u201d, we are shown a moment of outstanding moral significance. Yet even the moment of sacrifice arises within the context of a friendship, and what kind of \u201cfriendship\u201d would it be that was only ever sacrifice, never mutual enjoyment?</p>\n<h3>From Affection to Action</h3>\n<p>Our working definition stressed the combination of \u201caffection\u201d and \u201cdirection\u201d. Love gives affectionate direction to action; it fills us with something we feel and steers us to something we may do<em>. </em>We cannot be commanded simply to feel, but because the feeling of love is made concrete in action, we can be commanded to love. Though we recognise love first by feeling, it is already a readiness for action. But not only of the busy and energetic sort. Attentive acts, such as listening, learning and wondering, are action, too; in love these have a certain priority over the busy and energetic acts, as the story of Mary and Martha illustrates. Practical reason has both reflective and deliberative phases, attending to the good that can be admired, attending to the good that can be performed.</p>\n<h3>From Experiences to Persons</h3>\n<p>There are many types of good: experiences of sight and sound, states of existence, objective things and persons, qualities of action. We may \u201clove\u201d many different things: our food, playing tennis, those close to us, works of art, the horizons of our spiritual aspiration, all that shares in the created good that God has made. Aesthetic perception is shaped by love of beauty, theoretical enquiry by love of reason. More generally, there is the love of wisdom, in which we seek intelligent participation in a common life, and this is the foundation for all developed forms of work. To love, we must learn of the generic goods, of \u201cqualities\u201d. Yet the love-command makes <em>God and neighbour </em>the supreme object of love. We may extend our definition: love for God and neighbour is an <em>affective and directive attention to the good of persons: </em>God as divine person, the neighbour as \u201clike ourselves\u201d, possessing personal agency and self-determination.</p>\n<p>Personality is singular, not generic. To love a person it is not enough to have a liking for a kind of person (wise, affectionate, glamorous, energetic etc.), nor is it enough to be in a kind of relation with somebody (\u201ca\u201d marriage, \u201ca\u201d friendship, \u201ca\u201d good working-relationship, etc.). Personal love involves unique historical experience of God\u2019s goodness through and in that other person: <em>this </em>encounter with <em>this </em>person is a unique opening <em>for</em> <em>me</em>. Personal loves are open to reciprocity and mutual communion, as other loves are not. They have their forms and types \u2013 especially marriage, uniquely mutual and enduring, treated as an image of the communion of Christ and his followers (Ephesians 5:25\u201330), and friendship, also a central model for that same relation (John 15:12\u201314). But the full meaning of any personal relation is seen only as the form is filled with a particular content; we may want to be married or to make friends, but only marriage-<em>to-X, </em>and friendship-<em>with-Y, </em>will show us the goods that marriage and friendship really contain. Forms of beauty and wisdom, too, attract love, but are not where love finally comes to rest. \u201cWisdom is justified by all her children\u201d, we are told (Luke 7:35), which is to say, in persons who embody it. To love, we must learn to recognise personal singularity. Those who love the beauty of great drawing or fine music will learn to know <em>someone </em>whose personality appears through that art, Michelangelo, say, or Bach. Yet the singular does not leave its qualities behind. It would be nonsense to claim to love Bach not for his music but for himself. (Even Anna Magdalena Bach, who could love Bach \u201cfor himself\u201d more than we can, must have been glad she had married a musician!) To know him, we must grasp him as the central personal subject to which his exceptional musical powers belong, in whom they inhere. Jesus himself, inviting his disciples\u2019 love, presents himself in the person of Wisdom: \u201cTake my yoke upon you, and learn of me!\u201d (Matthew 11:29) To be in love with someone is to be affected both by <em>who </em>the person is and <em>what. </em>One cannot love without admiring, and so becoming in some respect wiser. But in love the \u201cwhat\u201d becomes unsubstitutably centred upon the \u201cwho\u201d.</p>\n<h2>4. Love, Desire and Eros</h2>\n<h3>Two Opposed Types of Love?</h3>\n<p>The account we have given so far has to confront the objections of a view popular in the twentieth century: that there are only two types of love, and they are radically opposed.</p>\n<p>Anders Nygren, with whom this thesis was prominently associated, called the two loves by Greek names, <em>agap\u0113 </em>and <em>er\u014ds, </em>the first identified as a love focussed on the other, the second as a love centred on the self. The theory was based on a philological curiosity: the word standardly used for \u201clove\u201d in the Greek of the New Testament was a rarity in classical and Hellenistic Greek, <em>agap\u0113, </em>and this suggested to him that the writers of the New Testament knew that they were speaking of something so qualitatively different that the standard words for love were unserviceable to them.<a class=\"anchor\" id=\"content100note2anc\" name=\"content100note2anc\">\u00a0</a><a class=\"note\" href=\"#content100note2sym\">[\u00a02\u00a0]</a> So filling the word <em>agap\u0113 </em>with the full moral conceptuality of love in the New Testament, and <em>er\u014ds </em>with what he imagined to be a Platonic ethic of self-realisation, he interpreted the one as self-giving and self-sacrifice, the other as self-centred, a nexus of desire, self-interest and acquisition. The two were essentially opposed, which means, though he hesitated to say so, morally opposed, as good to evil.</p>\n<p>Nygren\u2019s idealised <em>agap\u0113</em> is a prime instance of the mistake of canonising one moment of love and discarding the others. The love he commends to us is a love that cannot accept any kind of prior involvement of the self with the other, which would mean that its pure other-directedness would be compromised by self-love. From which it followed that it could not allow the retention of old love with settled affection. It is directed to the strange, the new and the alien, in which we find no recollection of ourselves. Dividing love into the two opposed dispositions, self-affirming and self-denying, enclosed and outgoing, exploitative and self-giving, Nygren\u2019s theory leaves no place for the extension of love through life, for a developing history of the self with the other, for the variety of moments and moods and contexts. And because the difference between <em>agap\u0113 </em>and <em>er\u014ds </em>is wholly a question of the orientation of the will, it has no place either for the qualification of love by knowledge. But love is, in fact, not solely a subjective disposition; it is a relation in feeling and knowledge between two subjects who are objects of love to one another. It must be judged in part by the truthfulness with which each grasps the reality of the other. Nygren imagined his idealised <em>agap\u0113</em> as effectively creating a new world out of nothing, \u201cconferring value\u201d on its object, indifferent to existing goods \u2013 in fact, re-enacting the very deed of creation itself.</p>\n<h3>Er\u014ds and Enquiry</h3>\n<p>Here Plato\u2019s ideal of <em>er\u014ds</em> did better than Nygren gave it credit for. He described <em>er\u014ds </em>specifically as the love of beauty, and imagined two stages by which beauty elicited it, \u201csupply\u201d and \u201cwant\u201d. First it presented something to wonder at, the moral importance of which lay in its revelatory power, and then it evoked a need, not simply to \u201cpossess\u201d the object, but to be productive under its influence. <em>Er\u014ds</em> was a moment of new beginning<em>, </em>a love of wisdom encountering its object for the first time, still asking questions that later stages of love might answer. It was the birth of enquiry, the moment of \u201cfascination\u201d: the mathematician conceives a problem, the reader is swept up in a web of poetic sound and meaning, the artist envisages a play of light and shade and form. Such moments of discovery, though they are specialised, are doors opening onto the beauty of wisdom as a whole, promising a kind of universal knowledge at the end of the pursuit. Personal loves differ from intellectual loves, in that they involve personal histories lived in freedom, and yet the same pattern of fascination can be seen in their initial moments. The beloved opens to the lover a view on the universe, which may even, as Dante held, lead to a vision of its Creator.</p>\n<h3>Desire and Self-Love</h3>\n<p>Nygren\u2019s <em>er\u014ds </em>turned Plato\u2019s experience of beauty inside out, seeing it as entirely self-enclosed. The roots of this lay in the Enlightenment, which had made self-love the principle of practical motivation: \u201cSelf-love, the spring of motion, acts the soul\u201d<a class=\"anchor\" id=\"content100note3anc\" name=\"content100note3anc\">\u00a0</a><a class=\"note\" href=\"#content100note3sym\">[\u00a03\u00a0]</a> When superimposed on the older Christian understanding of self-enclosure as radical sin, this idea of self-love as a mechanical trigger produced the general modern suspicion of desire, still evident in Nygren\u2019s idea of <em>er\u014ds</em> as desire, self-interest and acquisition. In fact desire is no more self-concerned than any other state of feeling, for all feeling involves self-consciousness as well as the consciousness of an object. Neither is all self-consciousness acquisitive. There is a moral self-consciousness about what is good <em>to do and to be, </em>which in English we call \u201cconscience\u201d<em>, </em>and this is supportive of the concern we owe our neighbour.</p>\n<p>The Christian tradition speaks of \u201cself-love\u201d with deliberate paradox. On the one hand, it is a true self-interest in the love of the neighbour; on the other hand, it is a false self-interest that treats the neighbour as a competitor for goods. This paradox goes back to Jesus\u2019 own teaching, when, under the shadow of the cross, he gave the warning that to gain one\u2019s life one must lose it (Mark 8:35 and parallels). The moral care we owe ourselves must embrace conscious self-loss; effective activity involves giving the resources of our life away. Loss is not an end in itself, but a necessary means to a life of greater effect. The same pattern applies to the more ordinary ways in which we serve one another. By giving ourselves in cooperative action, we prepare for a greater giving-away that will be required of us in death; yet death is not the horizon towards which we live, but the fuller life offered us beyond death. The paradox of self-love reflects a paradox of the self, which we can appear two quite different lights. There is a restricted self and an open self, a self we identify with our physical life, its comfort and its security, and a self we identify with a call to become something more than we are. True self-love is love of the true self, a self still to be fully realised in response to God\u2019s call, rejoicing in realities that give new form and purpose to its presence in the world. It is a reflective responsibility for ourselves before God, an answer to his demand that we should seek his kingdom and its justice.</p>\n<h2>5. Love and Knowledge</h2>\n<h3>A Challenging Question about the Love of Specialised Knowledge</h3>\n<p>We have come to an important conclusion. Love <em>seeks to develop itself in knowledge. </em>Truth, the criterion of knowledge, is also the criterion of love. Where there is truth, there may be falsehood, too, and love can fail by being false, not only by being weak. When St. Paul opposes love and knowledge (1 Corinthians 8:1) he employs a distinctive word, <em>gn\u014dsis, </em>to represent a false knowledge, a knowledge that \u201cpuffs up\u201d, contrasted with a love that \u201cbuilds up\u201d, a fascination with superficial and immediate phenomena that cuts us off from loving contact with the world God has given. But this windy knowledge is accompanied by an equally insubstantial love, \u201clove of the world\u201d, as St. John describes it, consisting in \u201cthe lust of the flesh, the lust of the eyes and the pride of life\u201d (1 John 2:15\u201316). Correspondingly, the stable love that ensures permanence allows a sober and affectionate grasp of reality. Those for whom specialised knowledge constitutes their sphere of work thus face a challenging question: how may they love that one aspect of the world which they know very well, while focussing their love finally upon God and their neighbours?</p>\n<h3>First Answer: Vocation</h3>\n<p>To which the first answer must be that they receive their work <em>as a vocation</em>, summoned to pay this close attention to this aspect of the world by the one who created and loves the world in all its aspects. On this we need say only that to love one\u2019s work, whatever it may be, one must love it for an end that can truly justify it. In understanding work as a vocation from God, that end is kept in view. The satisfaction we take in doing it well is a joy in having it to offer God, and also an anticipation of the joy of more unrestricted knowledge, the knowledge of the Creator himself.</p>\n<h3>Second Answer: Order</h3>\n<p>A second answer follows: loving the good of their work for God\u2019s sake, they seek to appreciate the <em>ordering</em> of goods that God has given. We call a special field of knowledge a \u201cbranch\u201d, appealing to the image of an ordered relation such as we see in organisms. The special good we know must be set in relation to the plenitude of all goods. Among these some are more fundamental, others less so, and it is always a question whether the goods we have come to love and know may restrict our view of more fundamental goods which God calls us to love and know. The idea of an \u201corder of love\u201d goes back to the early patristic era. Augustine developed it at length: inanimate things are loved \u201cfor the sake of animate things\u201d; creatures are loved \"for the sake of God\"; God alone is loved \"for his own sake\". Which was not meant to be understood as a ranking of preferences, as though one might choose between God and his creatures, nor as an ordering of means to ends, as though one might value creatures solely for their utility value. It was a reflective appreciation of each in its true relation to the others, a true knowledge of \u201cGod\u2019s world\u201d rather than only of things <em>in </em>the world, a love of God \u201cas\u201d<em> </em>God, of neighbour \u201cas\u201d neighbour, with an understanding what \u201cgodhead\u201d and \u201cneighbourhood\u201d imply.</p>\n<p><strong>The Temptations of Plural Fields of Knowledge </strong>Specialised professional knowledge has a plural and fragmentary character, shaped by the variety of independent enquiries. This poses no difficulty in principle; just as there are many people in God\u2019s world, and we can love only those whom space, time and opportunity put within our reach, so there are many things to know, and no one of us can know them all. It does, however, pose a temptation. Distinct enquiries create separate and distinct communities of enquiry, fenced in by invisible walls that distinguish those who are part of the enquiry from those who are not, held together by a solidarity of exclusive mutual esteem and sometimes bristling with defensive fortifications. Since the renaissance the work of knowledge has been known for its eristic character. The competitive spirit views specialist knowledge as a kind of property that confers power; in the present age, under pressure of cooperation with industry, the idea of intellectual property has assumed a major legal importance. There ought to be among us a deep sense that our knowledge is neither our own property nor our colleagues\u2019. Our knowledge is subject to the question the apostle puts to all our powers: \u201cWhat have you that you did not receive?\u201d (1 Corinthians 4:7)</p>\n<p>With these personal temptations we must notice the temptations of the institutional settings. The \u201cuniversity\u201d, conceived in the faith that a plurality of studies conducted together possessed a value that none could have on its own, gives way to the \u201cmultiversity\u201d, where forms of learning are marketed in competition with each other. Plurality is competition, and the value of any field of study is supposed to lie simply in its power to market itself. The university thus becomes a mirror of the prevailing concerns of society, rather than a resource to inform and correct them.</p>\n<p><strong>Established Knowledge </strong>If such moral dangers exist, arising from the tendency to entrench knowledge in doctrine and routine practices and closed professional communities, we can understand them as indicating an imbalance in love. Love, as we have said, is both old and new; there is a familiar love and an adventurous love, and the two must balance each other and build on each other. The love of knowledge is both old and new: a delight in learning what we did not know and a delight in retaining and affirming what we have learned. There is no reason to undervalue established forms of knowledge. No study can do without its basis of rationally agreed descriptions, and if we are to love people and things \u201cas\u201d what they are, we need to start with some prior understanding of what they are. Yet to <em>love </em>them is to be open to new communications about and with them. Within the practice of knowledge there must be a dynamic tension between consolidation and expansion, theoretical closure and discovery. The danger lies in finalising closures that can only be provisional. The same principle holds for professional activities. To treat patients \u201cas\u201d patients and students \u201cas\u201d students, healthcare practitioners and teachers need received frames of reference and accepted norms of practice. But these cannot exhaust the demands that loving knowledge of patients and students may make upon them. Many decisions lie beyond the scope of professional guidance, and professional practice itself needs interpretation by love. The love the Samaritan brought to the wounded man on the road was something over and above the professional competences of the priest and Levite (Luke 10:25\u201337). Or to take a more trivial example: the teacher faced with the tedious routine of grading examination scripts can justify strictness, consistency and efficiency as professionally correct, all on the basis of a love which considers the needs of students as a class, the needs of the institution, the standards of academic life, etc. But the teacher may also detect \u2013 one time in a hundred \u2013 a small and unexpected achievement hidden by a generally unsatisfactory performance, and love may insist on taking the costly detour to recognise it.</p>\n<p><strong>Communication </strong>These considerations remind us that a pursuit of knowledge is open to new development in more than one way. There can be new discoveries of thought and observation that challenge old paradigms, but there can also be new openings for the communication of knowledge. A special place in the economy of knowledge is held by studies which go beyond the default scientific model of explanatory theorising to recognising communications \u2013 historical studies especially, since historical distance is by far the most radical of all obstacles in the way of communicating human experience. No contemporary voice can speak to us about our own humanity in the way that voices from the past can. These studies largely, though not exclusively, turn around the art of intelligent reading, for it is writing brings within our range communications that time has put at a distance, and that is why writing is one key to what it means to be \u201ccivilised\u201d. But all fields of study may offer opportunities for receiving and giving new communications; and since it does not fall to many to be at the forefront of new discoveries, communication is perhaps the most important way in which our engagement with knowledge is kept pressing forward. Perhaps, it is the most important way anyway, since it brings the love of knowledge into immediate connection with the love of persons.</p>\n<h3>A Third Answer: Education</h3>\n<p>And so we add a third answer to our question. Love of knowledge must reaffirm the centrality of <em>education</em>, broadly construed, in which our knowledge is given to the service of others. Education is the transmission of knowledge in all its aspects, factual, theoretical and practical, and is usually distinguished from research, on the one hand, and from training on the other. But these distinctions are only relative. In the end there must be no pursuit of knowledge that does not aim at communication, and correspondingly no communication that does not hope to strengthen others to live well, not simply to perform certain tasks. Every \u201cuseful\u201d field of instruction \u2013 agriculture, medicine, art, economics \u2013 trains students for tasks of one kind or another; but they may also look beyond the tasks to educate for the life in which those tasks have their place. We may find ourselves in circumstances where our training, strictly understood, cannot help us; but we shall never be in a position where that is true of our education.</p>\n<p>But to educate for life is to educate <em>in ethics</em>. To dramatise the point: those with whose education we are concerned are at a point of decision, a parting of the ways between a life lived fruitfully to God\u2019s glory and a life wasted in mistakes and false directions. No education can deliver them from facing that decision, but it can provide resources for making it rightly. To educate ethically is not merely a matter of encouraging students to to expand their imaginations of good waiting to be done and supplying them with factual knowledge to do it. It is to help them overcome the gap between fact and imagination, to learn how idealistic Utopias may be brought to yield practical purposes, how factual information may be probed for opportunities of freedom. In other words, it teaches them to stop thinking of the world either as putty on which they can imprint their own designs, or as a granite wall on which they can survive only by spreadeagling themselves against it. Good disciplines of reflection and deliberation are learned as one sifts the merits of goals, absolutely and in relation to existing possibilities, and reassess possibilities ambitiously, in the light of goals.</p>\n<h2>6. Love as the Form of the Virtues</h2>\n<p>The plural branches of love that follow the branches of knowledge shed useful light on how and why we speak of \u201cvirtue\u201d and \u201cthe virtues\u201d in Christian ethics.<a class=\"anchor\" id=\"content100note4anc\" name=\"content100note4anc\">\u00a0</a><a class=\"note\" href=\"#content100note4sym\">[\u00a04\u00a0]</a> Virtue is a Hellenistic term, a rare visitor to the New Testament, but Jewish teachers in the Hellenistic world used \u201cvirtue\u201d (in the singular) to mark the convergence of law and wisdom in the Scriptures. Sometimes, too, they composed rhetorical lists of virtues and vices, and in this the New Testament followed them, and though it does not speak of \u201cvirtues\u201d and \u201cvices\u201d in that context, commentators have usually seen no reason not to do so. The lists are exploratory and varied, each presenting its own perspective on the development or decay of moral life.<a class=\"anchor\" id=\"content100note5anc\" name=\"content100note5anc\">\u00a0</a><a class=\"note\" href=\"#content100note5sym\">[\u00a05\u00a0]</a> They bring home to us that the moral phenomena they describe are both plural and fluid. Love is the unifying factor; virtue-lists typically begin with it (Galatians 5:22f.; Philippians 1:9\u201311; Revelation 2:19) or end with it (2 Peter 1:5\u20137; Colossians 2:12\u201314). It is the \u201cbond of perfection\u201d, and it is the \u201cgreatest\u201d in that triad of virtues that \u201cendure\u201d, faith, hope and love (1 Corinthians 13:13). The fathers insisted that love was not just one virtue among others. It was the \u201cartificer\u201d and \u201cpreserver\u201d of virtue, John Chrysostom wrote, the \u201cgolden chain\u201d that bound them together. The scholastics spoke of love as the \u201cform\u201d of the virtues, meaning, as St. Thomas explained, that as virtues direct acts to their end, so love directs virtues to their end.</p>\n<p>Virtues and vices are phenomena we observe, patterns of behaviour that arouse admiration and abhorrence as we see them in others, and with less clarity see them in ourselves. Virtues and vices are not principles of deliberation, specific counsels that we are guided by in deciding what to do. Rather, they display the variety of possibilities in the moral life. In this way the plurality of the virtues corresponds to the plurality of the fields of knowledge: the variety and richness of creation allows a variety of kinds of experience, and so a variety of acquired forms of love for God and neighbour. Yet since admiration and abhorrence create a desire to imitate and avoid, the opposition of virtues and vices form a kind of framework for our fields of deliberation, and we may derive principles of action from them, especially the more general principles that give longer-term direction to our lives.</p>\n<h3>Specificity</h3>\n<p>Virtues are dispositions specially determined by special situations: courage by the imminence of danger, humility by others\u2019 achievements and merits, patience by undertakings that are long in coming to fruition, etc. They suggest special norms to govern those situations: humility teaches us not to think too highly of ourselves, courage not to value safety above greater public goods, and so on. We can acquire special virtues from acting frequently in typical situations, but precisely because there are many types of situation and many different moral requirements, no one virtue can have a final obligatory force. Each is demanded as the situation indicates a specific good that we may love: a majestic good evoking love as humility, an imperilled good evoking love as courage, a deferred good evoking love as patience, etc. This lays on us the perpetual task of interpreting the situations we face and discerning the objects of love they present. All virtues are specifications of love. What cannot be love, cannot be the exercise of a virtue. (Uriah Heep was not, as he claimed, \u201chumble\u201d, but merely insinuating and manipulative.)</p>\n<p>Yet virtue can be misdirected, as love can. We can display the wrong virtue at the wrong time: humility when courage is needed, efficiency when patience is needed. Deeply habitual virtues can narrow our moral perception to see only what we are used to seeing, and the understanding which any one virtue supplies can never be all the practical wisdom we need, for the field of action is irreducibly plural. As in a social crisis no one expert can determine a course of action alone \u2013 how can an epidemiologist judge the psychological and economic implications of a lockdown? \u2013 so in the course of any human life no one virtue is all that is demanded. Scholarship has its distinctive virtues, patience high among them, but a scholar\u2019s life needs non-scholarly virtues, too \u2013 and not least, when asked to chair a meeting, decisiveness! To discern the special wisdom needed by any situation we require a further principle of discernment, and for this we must turn to love.</p>\n<h2>7. Love and Justice</h2>\n<h3>Justice and the Virtues</h3>\n<p>Justice may often be spoken of as a virtue, too: love operating within the special field of action that defends or establishes social order. Yet from its earliest philosophical reflections justice has seemed to stand rather apart from the other virtues. Plato, to whom we owe the idea of four \u201ccardinal virtues\u201d, saw justice as the organising virtue that kept prudence, courage and temperance in their place; Aristotle distinguished two kinds of justice, \u201cgeneral\u201d and \u201cspecial\u201d, of which the latter governed social transactions of distribution and compensation, while general justice involved the exercise of all the other virtues in a social context. For both these thinkers justice was differentiated by a kind of universality, which put it in a position analogous to that of love in Jesus\u2019s teaching. In the New Testament the difference of justice is even more marked. Justice is primarily an attribute of God, designating the self-consistency of all that he wills and does in the world, his \u201cjudgments\u201d; only secondarily is it an attribute of human acts, and that not in respect of their intentions, but of their actual conformity to God\u2019s judgments. To be <em>dikaios, </em>as the New Testament understands it, is to be an object of a favourable judgment \u2013 primarily divine judgment and sometimes, consequently, human. Justice marks the point at which the drama of love in command, virtue and practice reaches its end and is pronounced on. If love must be the first word on our moral tasks, \u201cjustice\u201d must be the last, the horizon on which love is proven, a universal moral goal which is the \u201cfruit\u201d or \u201ccrown\u201d of a life lived in love.<a class=\"anchor\" id=\"content100note6anc\" name=\"content100note6anc\">\u00a0</a><a class=\"note\" href=\"#content100note6sym\">[\u00a06\u00a0]</a></p>\n<p>So as love seeks knowledge, so love seeks justice. Knowledge and justice are both modalities of the truth love seeks: on the one hand a truth joyfully affirmed, on the other a truth embodied practically in social order. In justice \u201cyour neighbour\u201d is \u201cas yourself\u201d, not only in the way you feel about him, or even act towards him, but in full public recognition. Moral virtues may be exercised in secret, but justice only in public, and love\u2019s goal is to express itself in public reality. And as we said that the love of knowledge needs to be ordered to an end in the full knowledge of God, so we must say that love of practical knowledge needs an end in the justice of God\u2019s kingdom.</p>\n<h3>Provisional Justice and Law</h3>\n<p>With justice, as with knowledge, there is a danger of finalising the provisional. The justice we want is always more than the justice we can achieve. The parallel between knowledge and justice applies here, too: our own partial judgments stand in relation to the justice God will bring about as our fragmentary knowledge stands to the fulness of the revelation of God. The resources human judgment can call upon are limited, sufficient at best for the small scale, where we may be able to describe a case, if not completely, yet with some measure of adequacy, and do something to set it right. To describe and correct all the wrongs of history is beyond us. How, for instance, could we ever give an adequate account of, and make sufficient amends for, such a large-scale historical offence as colonial slavery? In resorting too lightly and hastily to judgment, we run the risk of adding new layers to the tale of wrongs. <em>Summum ius,</em> <em>summa iniuria</em>, said the classical proverb; to which Jesus added the counsel, \u201cJudge not, that you be not judged\u201d (Matthew 7:1).</p>\n<p>Yet while being reserved, we should not be sceptical about the judgments we may be given to do. They are limited to their time and place and relative to the immediate need. They scoop up the water of justice from a flowing river, as it were in cupped hands, to quench an urgent thirst. They are always provisional, never the last word but following the direction of love and waiting on its fulfilment. And yet they can be real and effective anticipations of God\u2019s justice. There is a true historical record of judgments reached and performed, which witness to God\u2019s work in the past and his purposes for the future.</p>\n<h3>Two Examples from the History of Law and Justice</h3>\n<p>Two examples in the past of how Christian hope has yielded judgments that have taught the world something new about God\u2019s purposes may be sufficient to suggest others.</p>\n<p>The first is <em>international law. </em>Believing that even \u201csovereign\u201d governments were subject to the rule and law of God, even the earliest Christian thinkers sought to articulate the form of a \u201claw of nations\u201d that could reflect and correspond to God\u2019s law. The law of war, anciently understood as part of the \u201claw of nature\u201d, they interpreted as an implication of the law of love. To understand why the conduct of war had to be subject to forms and regulations, belligerents must weigh the duties and restraints of love that even the consciousness of a just cause could not excuse them from. Contemporary international law owes many of the categories and assumptions to Christian reasoning.</p>\n<p>The second example is <em>punishment.</em> Construed according to its ancient definition as <em>malum passionis pro malo actionis, </em>\u201csuffering inflicted in respect of wrong done\u201d, it forms an integral part of ordered political life, as we know it, upholding the authority of law. But punishment does not have to be in any given form, and it has been a Christian political hope to shape punishment as a witness to the forgiveness of sins extended to all offenders, eliminating pointless inflictions that served no social end and especially by restraining the use of the death penalty. The claims of penal justice are important, but cannot be absolute. They have always to serve the actual needs of society and the conditions of political practicality, and an ideal of penal justice that cannot be made to do this is of no service to love.</p>\n<p>Absolute justice there is none in this world \u2013 or the next, for when \u201cmercy triumphs over judgment\u201d (James 3:10), that is a truth not only about our own acts of judgment but about history as a whole. The last word in history, as the prophetic vision of John of Patmos saw it, is the \u201ccity of peace\u201d, where God dwells in communion with mankind for \u201cthe healing of the nations\u201d. There is justice, an order governed by love. The next-to-last word of judgment must have its place until then, yet always looking forward to the last word, overcoming of the bitterness of war and the shame of guilt.</p>\n<h2>8. Conclusion</h2>\n<p>We began from love as the interpretation of the law: on the one hand specific patterns of practical knowledge in need of the purpose of love to make them morally intelligible, on the other, love as the primary obligation, demanding expression in specific patterns of practical knowledge. From this, in conclusion, we may draw two warnings.</p>\n<p>It is a warning, in the first place, against <em>abstract norms of knowledge and action</em>. Those whose business it is to find and share knowledge must recognise that merely to know is not to know. To know what we know, we must know it in the service of love. Which does not mean that knowledge is squeezed into a utilitarian straitjacket, or its value for its own sake denied. For to love knowledge as a blessing to mankind is to love it for what it is: a dimension of life itself, a ground of common enjoyment, a purchase on reality which permits action, fellowship and the praise of God. Merely t<em>o </em>know how to act, similarly, is not to know how to act. For effective agency needs more than norms; it needs an appreciable and worthwhile end given to it to pursue.</p>\n<p>It is a warning, secondly, against an <em>impractical idea of love</em> that is confined to attitude and feelings, and does not form a practical direction for action. Love is more than a general benevolent will, resigning the questions of how to act to a practical reason that can function independently of it. A love that is alive and shapes life seeks to discern goods that are given us to do. If we say that love is a \u201cmotive\u201d for all knowledge and all action, we shall not be wrong; but we must not understand \u201cmotive\u201d too restrictively, simply as an impulse that initiates. Love is to be the end of our knowing and acting, not only the beginning of it. The proximate end of our knowledge is to know in love, and the proximate end of our action is to establish justice in love, in each case re-shaping and renewing the knowledge and action that we had before. But their final end is to know as we have been known, in God\u2019s compassionate understanding, and to act as we have been acted upon, in God\u2019s persistent grace.</p>\n<p>That is why love is not simply a virtue we may learn to practice for ourselves. The love of God must be \u201cpoured into our hearts by the Holy Spirit that is given us\u201d (Romans 5:5).</p>\n<h2 class=\"new_page\">End Notes</h2>\n<p class=\"endnote\"><a class=\"note\" href=\"#content100note1anc\">[\u00a01\u00a0]</a><a class=\"anchor\" id=\"content100note1sym\" name=\"content100note1sym\">\u00a0</a> William Shakespeare, <em>Sonnet </em>116.</p>\n<p class=\"endnote\"><a class=\"note\" href=\"#content100note2anc\">[\u00a02\u00a0]</a><a class=\"anchor\" id=\"content100note2sym\" name=\"content100note2sym\">\u00a0</a> The true reason for the use of <em>agap\u0113 </em>in the New Testament was probably not philosophical, but simply an idiom of Hellenistic Jewish Greek. In the Septuagint, which influenced them, <em>agap\u0101n </em>translated the Hebrew <em>\u0101hab, </em>the most general verb for \u201clove\u201d. There were other common words for love in ancient Greek as well as these two. As well as <em>eros, </em>Plato and Aristotle made much of <em>philia \u2013 </em>\u201cfriendship\u201d, though the English word fails to convey its breadth. C.S. Lewis 1963, whose <em>The Four Loves, </em>written in conscious reaction against the dualist thesis, did a service to the debate by widening the range further by recalling <em>storg\u0113, </em>commonly used of close familial and social bonds. Yet the discussion of love does not, in the end, depend on how many ancient Greek words for love there were.

Roughly, English \u201cjustice\u201d corresponds to Aristotle\u2019s \u201cspecial justice\u201d, while \u201crighteousness\u201d corresponds to his \u201cgeneral justice\u201d. (An older English usage favoured \u201cequity\u201d for general justice.) Translators import this distinction back into English translations of the Bible, and may have persuasive reasons for doing so, but in asking how the New Testament speaks of <em>dikaiosyn\u0113 </em>and its cognates, we should not prejudge the matter. (ii) Greek makes a distinction where English does not, using a different root<em> </em>for the act of \u201cjudgment\u201d, which is <em>krisis. </em>But the two terms remain closely connected, because Greek translators of the Hebrew Scriptures employed both roots to translate the Hebrew, <em>\u0161pt, </em>which is both \u201cjustice\u201d and \u201cjudgment\u201d.</p>\n<h2 class=\"new_page\">Further Reading</h2>\n<p>Barth, Karl. 1958. \u201cThe Holy Spirit and Christian Love\u201d. <em>Church Dogmatics</em> IV.ii.

    "bodyText": "In considering how briefly to respond to Professor O\u2019Donovan\u2019s Brief from the perspective of my own discipline \u2013 that of historical research and writing \u2013 a constructive point of convergence is with part of the working definition that he offers: love as \u2018 directive attention to the good of persons\u2019 and its corollary that to love, we must learn to recognise personal singularity. In what follows I aim briefly to make two points in relation to historical method and one in relation to the fruits of historical study. These points can be understood either in a weak sense\u2014that there is an analogy between the practice of history and the practice of love; or in a strong sense\u2014that there is an identity between good historical practice and the practice of love.\n\nIn contemplating the Brief during the season when the western church celebrates the ascension of Christ, I was drawn to the model provided by the stories of Jesus\u2019 post- resurrection responses to the needs of his disciples as related in John\u2019s gospel.\n\nIn John 20 we see Thomas, absent from Jesus first appearance to the disciples, pronouncing that he cannot believe unless he can first see and touch. Here, if I understand the force of the Greek \u2018pisteuo\u2019 correctly, Thomas is saying not that he cannot give mental assent to the proposition that God has raised Jesus from the dead but rather something much more personal and relational \u2013 that he cannot put his trust in the one whom God has raised from the dead, unless he can first see and touch. Jesus\u2019s response to Thomas\u2019s dilemma is paradigmatically a response of love \u2013 the lover seeks out the beloved where he is to be found, at the point of his need, and meets him there. It is to this motion of love that Thomas responds with commitment as he discovers that the need to touch is superfluous.\n\nWhat is perhaps implicit in the Thomas story is rendered explicit in the story of Peter in chapter 21. Here Jesus twice asks Peter, \u2018do you love me\u2019?, using the more comprehensive language of \u2018agapeo\u2019, while Peter responds in the more restricted language of \u2018fileo\u2019, perhaps usefully rendered as \u2018Peter do you love me? \u2026 \u2018Lord you know that I am your friend\u2019. On the third occasion as the language in the text emphasises Jesus effectively says something like: If that is where you are Peter then that is where we will make our new beginning \u2013 and adopting the disciple\u2019s own language asks \u2018Peter, are you my friend?\u2019\n\nIt is in this motion of love to seek the beloved in their own situatedness rather than imposing on them our own that I see the first link with good historical method. This always seeks the richest possible understanding of persons and societies in the past on their own terms and in their own contexts. It precisely seeks to \u2018recognise personal singularity\u2019 in persons in history, not construct them as cardboard characters as fodder for our own theories, or as entirely imaginary autonomous rational actors. Instead it aims, in an act of imagination controlled by evidence, to see them embedded in overlapping series of social relations of mutual obligation and exchange, with individual desires and constraints, and characteristic views of the world. In making such reconstructions, historians can still endeavour to rescue people in the past from what E. P. Thompson, in a well-worn but still serviceable phrase, termed \u2018the enormous condescension of posterity\u2019.\n\nIf we understand love as directed by \u2018 attention to the good of persons\u2019 , then we underline a second and essential characteristic of the motion of love evident in the stories of Jesus Thomas and Peter which is that it is a motion in quest of a free and willing response.\n\nLove between persons respects, both in the sense of creating a space for and in the sense providing a richer context for the agency of the beloved. In the case of Thomas, his agency is displayed in his affective and effective response to Christ\u2019s appearing; in John 21 love and agency are inseparable \u2013 \u2018Peter do you love me?\u2019 \u2013 \u2018feed my sheep\u2019. Such commitments I would argue are also intrinsic to good historical method. There have, of course been histories that abstract past actors from their contexts and so provide impoverished, if highly coloured, depictions of their agency \u2013 so-called \u2018great man\u2019 theories of history. [\u00a01\u00a0] There have also been historiographical traditions that have treated the agency of people in the past as essentially irrelevant in the face of economic and social structures visualised as tectonic plates that represent the real ineluctable motive force of historical development. [\u00a02\u00a0]\n\nNeither of these are satisfactory and rich historical study has always sought to uncover and understand both the choices made by people in the past and the contexts, including structural constraints, within which they made them. This can happen on a micro scale in the study of individuals and communities which are the subject of my own historical practice. But the same commitments are also enriching on a macro scale. Take for example the difference between the judgement that the outbreak of the First World War in 1914 was caused by railway timetables, evidently facile however confidently it was pronounced by eminent historians and a realistic account of the same event. Take, for example, the work of the Cambridge Historian, Christopher Clark, who by creatively asking a different question \u2013 not why the war broke out but how it came to break out \u2013 opened up to his readers a whole world of agency among decision makers all over the continent of Europe operating within distinctive cultures of risk-taking and unique appreciations of opportunities and threats. [\u00a03\u00a0] (Clark\u2019s work is of course paralleled by a much larger literature which seeks to give due attention to the role of the actors in the \u2018July Crisis\u2019 [\u00a04\u00a0] of 1914 as well as the constraints on their agency).\n\nMy last point, made necessarily even more briefly, relates less to the practice and more to the promise of history. O\u2019Donovan\u2019s statement of love as \u2018 directive attention to the good of persons ,\u2019 I would argue, not only seeks out the beloved in their own situatedness and respects and encourages their agency. It is also as a way of seeing persons that invites them to a richer wholeness a vision of a better future \u2013 in the case of Peter, the restoration to him of his vocation as part of the royal priesthood of the people of God.\n\nSo far as historical study has an urgent social purpose, directed by love, I would contend that its richest fruit lies precisely in understanding the past in order to help us imagine different and better futures. This is not, I hasten to add, by the process of trying to learn lessons from history \u2013 a treacherous pursuit which has notoriously tended to lead armies to prepare to fight the last war rather than the next one. Instead, it lies in the characteristic tendency of history to de-naturalise the present. Potentially oppressive structures and patterns of thought, for example, the modern versions of the notions of \u2018natural\u2019 and \u2018supernatural\u2019 which structure much modern thinking, [\u00a05\u00a0] or the idea that human beings are divisible into races as opposed to a previous stress on their common adamic descent, [\u00a06\u00a0] gain much of their power by presenting themselves to us as natural and necessary realities. [\u00a07\u00a0] When historical study (as it has in both these cases) reveals that such notions are instead recent and historically contingent, so the future becomes more open, and we are encouraged to meet it by joining faith and hope to love.\n\n[\u00a01\u00a0] Such theories have a long pedigree in the Western historiographical tradition with early examples like Plutarch\u2019s parallel lives. The role of the great man in the Anglophone world was given fresh impetus in the nineteenth century by the historical work of Thomas Carlyle, for example, in his history of Frederick the Great and remains the constant temptation of works of historical biography and the sort of popular Christian history writing concerned with the construction of heroes and exemplary narratives.\n\n[\u00a02\u00a0] Typical examples would include some Marxist influenced historiography which sees history as principally concerned with the development of modes of economic production and the history of class struggle, and some of the work of the French historians of the Annales school, whose characteristic emphasis on the longue dur\u00e9e in history tended to squeeze the importance of both the history of events and the role of human agency.\n\n[\u00a03\u00a0] Christopher Clark, The Sleepwalkers How Europe Went to War in 1914 (2013). It is not necessary to agree with Clark\u2019s interpretation to recognise the creative force of asking a new question and his commitment to both context and agency in this work.\n\n[\u00a04\u00a0] The July Crisis is the general term given to the diplomatic and military responses to the assassination of Archduke Franz Ferdinand and his wife Sophie on 28 June 1914.\n\n[\u00a05\u00a0] For a history of the development of this idea see Peter Harrison, Some New World Myths of Supernatural Belief in a Secular Age (2024).\n\n[\u00a06\u00a0] For an examination of the complex histories of this idea and their interaction with the interpretation of the bible see, for example, Colin Kidd, The Forging of Races: Race and Scripture in the Protestant Atlantic World 1600-2000 (2006).\n\n[\u00a07\u00a0] Participants in other disciplines will more readily recognise examples pertinent to their own practice than the ones given here and sometimes the process of de-naturalisation may be best thought of as adding richness or complexity to a debate rather than gaining freedom from oppression. An example might be the recognition of the relative novelty of the idea that nation states are natural and legitimate forms of political organisation while empires are not \u2013 an idea which, often unproblematised, drives discourse in some kinds of politics and history writing.",

    "bodyText": "The intelligibility of biblical law is derived from love, in that \u2018love orients all moral direction in Scripture\u2019, writes Professor O\u2019Donovan . [\u00a01\u00a0] The love-command directs us to love fellow-creatures as an indirect way of loving the invisible God, the neighbour presenting us with a reflection of God\u2019s claim to our love. But what is love and what is it to love our neighbour? Professor O\u2019Donovan discusses a number of concepts as being important to the definition of love, notably norms of agency, reciprocity, and mutuality. In this Brief, my focus is on how these norms are relevant to sexual violence theory and law. I illustrate how law reform on the meaning of consent can be understood, from a Christian perspective, as aligning with an expansive understanding of the duty of neighbour-love.\n\nProfessor O\u2019Donovan begins with a working direction of love as an affective and directive attention to a good. But because the love-command makes God and neighbour the supreme object of love, the definition is extended:\n\nlove for God and neighbour is an affective and directive attention to the good of persons : God as divine person, the neighbour as \u201clike ourselves\u201d, possessing personal agency and self-determination.\n\nOur neighbour is like us, made in the image of God, capable of agency (acting independently, making one\u2019s own free choices) and self-determination (directing one\u2019s life according to one\u2019s values and desires): this is the language of human dignity. The image-bearing conception of humankind is central to many Western accounts of dignity as the foundational value of human rights law. [\u00a02\u00a0] This is often related to a Kantian moral outlook: the intrinsic worth of persons requires treating people not as means to an end, but as ends in themselves, thereby respecting their autonomy (self-governing), agency, and personhood. [\u00a03\u00a0] As explored below, autonomy and agency are also central in many accounts of the values at stake when it comes to sexual violence law.\n\nBut Professor O\u2019Donovan goes on to consider personal love as the experience of God \u2018through and in that other person\u2019. Here we see love framed as an experience of reciprocity and mutuality. Also as explored below, norms of reciprocity and mutuality have been central to reform movements in sexual violence law. Specifically, in many jurisdictions which have pursued progressive law reform, consent has been redefined as something that must be communicated in order to have legal effect. This recognizes that sexual encounters should be predicated on mutual, reciprocal and respectful communication.\n\nAutonomy is often conceived of as the key value at stake when it comes to sexual violence, closely tied to the discourse of dignity. Historically, the harm of rape was framed as an affront to (white, landholding) male dignity and autonomy \u2013 by violating (trespassing on) another man\u2019s wife or unmarried daughter (property) without his consent, the rapist undermined the patriarch\u2019s authority, agency, dignity. In this conservative theory of rape, [\u00a04\u00a0] women were not seen as autonomous, and their bodies were objectified as sites of a harm done to men . In time, a more liberal theory of rape emerged, which understands rape as an affront to the victim\u2019s autonomy and dignity. [\u00a05\u00a0]\n\nHowever, rape law continued to understand consent as an internal attitude, meaning it was valid in law and society to make assumptions and inferences about whether another person was willing to engage in sexual activity, even in the absence of that person communicating, by way of words or actions, their willingness. This validation of \u2018assumed consent\u2019 historically served men well, accommodating an interest in hazarding non-communicated sexual desire, and placing an onus on women to either resist and fight back or acquiesce (the \u201cresistance requirement\u201d).\n\nCrucially, \u2018assumed consent\u2019 aligns with the idea of atomistic, equally positioned individuals taking responsibility for asserting and protecting their own individual sexual autonomy by voicing non-consent. Assumed consent, then, is not necessarily in conflict with the value of autonomy. Rather, it works to put the onus of protecting autonomy on the individual, requiring that they correct, by way of resistance, any mistaken assumptions made about their state of mind. And if they fail to resist, but claim not to have (internally) consented, this in practice requires judges and juries to engage with the fine, perhaps impossible, distinction between non-consensual submission or acquiescence, and reluctant but willing consent. [\u00a06\u00a0]\n\nIn sum, the norm of autonomy can lead to an undue focus on individual responsibility and, in the case of women, insufficient attention to the impact of patriarchal norms of aggression/acquiescence [\u00a07\u00a0] on one\u2019s ability to act autonomously and with agency.\n\nI have elsewhere argued that by adopting an expansive sexual dignity framing of sexual violence law, the focus shifts to the repudiation of personhood that occurs when people\u2019s subjectivity, including their bodily integrity and autonomous choices and desires, is disrespected or disregarded. [\u00a08\u00a0] By personhood, I mean the inherent moral worth of individuals as subjects rather than objects \u2013 beings capable of self-definition, agency and dignity. Subjectivity refers to the lived experience of that personhood: the capacity to feel, choose, and express one\u2019s desires, autonomy, and embodied selfhood. Dignity emphasises that everyone is entitled to equal respect for their personhood, including their desires and autonomy interests, and regardless of interpersonal differences in position and power. This supports the moral claim that people should act with due regard for equality and mutuality in sexual encounters, with a corresponding onus to actively ascertain and act according to the interests of others, rather than making self-serving assumptions. In other words, to respect the full personhood of others requires attending to their equal autonomy interests, in a way that aligns with norms of mutuality and reciprocity.\n\nThis leads to a construction of consent as something that is inherently relational and communicative, rather than individual/solitary. Respect and regard for sexual dignity requires mutually ascertaining and communicating about consent. [\u00a09\u00a0] As such, it is morally blameworthy to assume an internal attitude of consent in the absence of communication, regardless of whether one happens to assume correctly. This results in a construction of sexual violation (and related offences) in law that is grounded in the wrongfulness of disregarding autonomy by failing to communicate, also known as \u2018communicative\u2019 or \u2018affirmative consent\u2019. [\u00a010\u00a0] Put another way, communicative or affirmative consent requires that each party actively engage with the other\u2019s subjectivity\u2014their desires, boundaries, and autonomy\u2014through reciprocal communication, rather than relying on internal assumptions or silence.\n\nFor better or worse, consent is central to the theory and legal definition of sexual violation. In thinking critically about the meaning of consent, it is useful to have regard to underlying values. And in turn our discussion about underlying values of autonomy, mutuality and reciprocity can be viewed from a Christian perspective as relating to the meaning of love for one\u2019s neighbour. Is our understanding of love and dignity expansive enough to encompass not only autonomy but mutuality and reciprocity?\n\nIt has often been the case that the legal approach to consent has been too narrowly focused on autonomy. This leaves too much space for aggression, coercion and acquiescence. Love and consent can be construed more broadly. These sentiments are poignantly illustrated in the following excerpt from Tracey Slaughter\u2019s \u2018Deleted Scenes for Lovers\u2019: [\u00a011\u00a0]\n\nSo I guess I have to call it consent. But I\u2019ve been reading about consent lately and it seems to me when they made up the idea they left spaces for way too much pain, too much pressure. There\u2019s part of the word that sounds okay and is all about feeling and thinking the same, about two bodies and minds just sharing themselves because, I don\u2019t know, they match, they touch, and their skins light up in some kind of agreement. But there\u2019s this other side of the word which doesn\u2019t sound right to me at all: to yield, it says, to acquiesce to what is done or proposed by another, to comply. There are ways in which that could still hurt. It sounds to me like there\u2019s stacks of ways you could get yourself thrashed black and blue under cover of that word.\n\nIn returning to O\u2019Donovan\u2019s theology of love, we are reminded that love is not merely a sentiment but a directive force\u2014one that orients moral reasoning and animates law with intelligibility and purpose. His emphasis on agency, reciprocity, and mutuality as essential to neighbour-love resonates deeply with contemporary efforts to reimagine sexual consent. The cross-disciplinary conversation between theology and law illuminates Christian thoughts on love and offers a theological grounding for legal norms that seek to honour the full personhood of others. In this way, the sovereignty of love becomes a moral imperative for reshaping law. It calls us to a justice that is not abstract or procedural, but deeply responsive to the dignity, desires and vulnerabilities of our neighbours.\n\nBurgess-Jackson, Keith (1995) \u201cRape and persuasive definition\u201d\u00a025 Canadian Journal of Philosophy 415.\n\nHigh, Anna (2022) \u201cSexual dignity and rape law\u201d\u00a033(2) Yale Journal of Law & Feminism 1.\n\nHigh, Anna (2022) \u201cReluctant consent\u201d New Zealand Law Journal 310.\n\nHigh, Anna (2023) 45(4) \u201cComparing affirmative consent models: Confusion, substance and symbolism\u201d Sydney Law Review 467.\n\nNaffine, Ngaire (1994) 57(1) \u201cErotic love in the law of rape\u201d Modern Law Review 10.\n\nPineau, Lois (1989) \u201cDate rape: A feminist analysis\u201d 8 Law and Philosophy 217.\n\nPirini, Mihiata, & High, Anna (2021) \u201cDignity and mana in the \u2018Third Law\u2019 of Aotearoa New Zealand\u201d\u00a029(4) New Zealand Universities Law Review 623.\n\nWiener, Robin (1983) \u201cShifting the communication burden: A meaningful consent standard in rape\u201d\u00a06 Harvard Women\u2019s Law Journal, 6 .\n\n[\u00a01\u00a0] Professor O\u2019Donovan\u2019s discussion of the duty of neighbour-love as orienting law reflects natural law theories of jurisprudence. Natural law posits inherent norms and principles derived from moral claims which underlie and inform human-made law. However, my response does not dwell on the natural law / positivism debate.\n\n[\u00a02\u00a0] See generally Mihiata Pirini and Anna High \u201cDignity and mana in the \u2018Third Law\u2019 of Aotearoa New Zealand\u201d (2021) 29(4) New Zealand Universities Law Review 623.\n\n[\u00a03\u00a0] For discussion of the Judeo-Christian foundation of Kant\u2019s theory of human dignity, see Jeffrie G Murphy (1998) \u201cThe Concept-conception distinction\u201d 9 Philosophical Issues 187.\n\n[\u00a04\u00a0] See Keith Burgess-Jackson (1995) \u201cRape and persuasive definition\u201d 25 Canadian Journal of Philosophy 415, 443-452 (setting out a typology of three theories of rape: conservative, liberal and radical).\n\n[\u00a05\u00a0] See generally Anna High (2022) \u201cSexual dignity and rape law\u201d 33(2) Yale Journal of Law & Feminism 1 at 8-9.\n\n[\u00a06\u00a0] Anna High (2022) \u201cReluctant consent\u201d New Zealand Law Journal 310.\n\n[\u00a07\u00a0] See generally Ngaire Naffine (1994) \u201cErotic love in the law of rape\u201d 57(1) Modern Law Review 10.\n\n[\u00a08\u00a0] High above n 5.\n\n[\u00a09\u00a0] Such claims about respect, mutuality, and consent as relational have been put forward in a number of iterations in scholarship and feminist jurisprudence. Perhaps most notably, Lois Pineau, in her seminal \u201cDate rape\u201d article, advocated for affirmative consent on the basis that the alternative \u2013 an \u2018aggressive contractual model\u2019 of sex in which women are obliged to either submit to unwanted sex or vigorously refuse \u2013 ignores mutuality, disrespecting the \u201cdialectics of desire\u201d: Lois Pineau \"Date rape: A feminist analysis\" (1989) 8 Law & Philosophy l 217.\b See also Robin D Wiener, \u201cShifting the communication burden: A meaningful consent standard in rape\u201d (1983) 6 Harvard Women\u2019s Law Journal 143, 158-9 (arguing that a lack of awareness of a sexual partner\u2019s unwillingness, due to failure to communicate, \u201cshows an absence of concern with the woman\u2019s wishes and feelings that is consistent with the objectification of women\u201d).\n\n[\u00a010\u00a0] See generally Anna High (2023) \u201cComparing affirmative consent models: Confusion, substance and symbolism\u201d 45(4) Sydney Law Review 467.\n\n[\u00a011\u00a0] \u2018Consent\u2019 in Tracey Slaughter Deleted Scenes for Lovers (2016, Victoria University Press) 115.",

    "bodyText": "At the core of economic analysis is the idea that there are gains from trade between economic agents, such as individuals, businesses, states. The simplest formulation has two agents with different endowments of goods, who by trading with each other can attain bundles of goods that satisfy them better than did their initial bundles. It is \u2018rational\u2019 to trade in this way. But the gains are limited to finding partner agents who both have goods that you desire and are interested in goods you can offer. If I need a cleaner for my apartment, I need to find a cleaner who is seeking tutorials in economics\u2014the \u2018good\u2019 I am competent to deliver. The \u2018genius\u2019 of the market price system is that we no longer need to rely on such an unlikely coincidence. Economic agents can supply goods or services which are surplus to their own requirements and use the resulting income to buy other goods or services that they want. The consequence is that there is no need for direct connection between the supplier and the purchaser: I may pay my cleaner and establish a relationship with him or her, but I have no idea who supplies the cleaning materials that the cleaner uses. I may not even identify the retailer if I buy those materials myself online. Economic transactions, then, are generally characterised by a degree of anonymity. As a result, the purchasers of a good or service cannot rely on the empathy often offered by known trading partners. In a worst case, they need to guard their own interests somewhat suspiciously as caveat emptor ('let the buyer beware') reminds us.\n\nWell-functioning trade between economic agents is predicated on relatively benign behaviour by the agents [\u00a01\u00a0] . There is a long-held view that in some circumstances behaviour may be far from benign. For example, a single (monopolist) seller or a single (monopsonistic) buyer of a good may exploit their market power to \u2018rip off\u2019 the other parties to transactions. However, the most serious issues arise when a buyer or seller has more information about the potential trade than their counterpart. It may be impossible for a buyer to assess the quality of a good or service on offer, if this cannot be ascertained directly by inspection. Indeed, a moment\u2019s thought should convince us that this is probably true of most goods and services we purchase. Rational economic actors would be expected to take advantage of their private information if they can, though a desire to build reputations in repeated transactions, and competition from other suppliers, are restraining forces.\n\nWho is my neighbour and how might I love my neighbour in these and related circumstances? O\u2019Donovan\u2019s vision of love argues that love involves seeking the good of the other person. Whether the identified \u2018good\u2019 is right for the other is critical, which depends on the correctness (truth or untruth) of the definition of the good in their circumstances. The order of reality must shape love: if someone is starving then love will meet their need for food; if someone is grieving, then love will take the form of supporting and comforting them in their grief; if someone needs affirmation then love will seek to affirm their worth and encourage them. In other words, the form that a loving action will take should be, as far as possible, \u2018tailor made\u2019 to the situation of the recipient.\n\nIf this is correct, then markets are not a straightforward arena in which to obey the love command. However, the seller can ask whether a particular transaction will contribute to the flourishing of the purchaser. Evidently in situations where the seller is not transparent about the features of the product or service, the buyer may be fooled into making a purchase which is not in his or her own interests. A contentious example featured in the global financial crisis, where some major financial institutions were found to have sold financial products that they privately knew would fail and hence incur losses for those who bought them.\n\nAn ethical purchaser must also ask whether the transaction is conducive to the good of the supplier. Obvious examples are where a product has been manufactured under conditions that demean the workers or has grown under conditions that harm the environment. Another possibility is to inquire into the situation of a whole group or class of people who are involved in the transactions. Resultant actions might include consumer boycotts of products or producers [\u00a02\u00a0] , or suppliers taking steps to prevent products being sold to people who are vulnerable in some way. The questions we have just asked are not always easy to answer, since they rely on hard-to-obtain knowledge of individuals or groups, but sometimes an educated guess is at hand.\n\nBut if fellow transactors are completely anonymous, what then should a conscientious purchaser or seller do? Both must take advantage of general truths about transactions. A seller (either of a good or service, or of labour) can indirectly love the buyers by committing to providing high quality. Good workmanship or conscientious effort on the part of the seller herself can greatly benefit the neighbour who is purchasing the good or service. In this way the sellers\u2019 love for neighbour can spread to purchasers who are unknown to them. Purchasers, too, can look after what they have purchased to both beautify creation and increase the longevity of the item. Furthermore, they can dispose of it in a manner that respects the environment (and therefore fellow-stewards). For both purchasers and sellers what might be called \u2018good order\u2019 in markets \u2013 making sure they operate in fair and transparent ways \u2013 is another very general form of love. If the good or service is intrinsically bad, however, then this \u2018good order\u2019 of markets may instead imply restrictions to trade, or outright bans, which would properly fall under the responsibility of the \u2018ruling authorities\u2019 (Rom\u00a013) rather than individual purchasers or consumers.\n\nMarket outcomes can, as is often noted, have profound effects on the overall distribution of income in a society. This is an unintended consequence of the workings of the \u2018invisible hand\u2019 of the market economy. The invisible hand is rightly celebrated for the advantages of competitive pressure in assuring quality and the resolution of shortages and gluts via flexible prices \u2013 whilst being infamously blind to considerations of income distribution. Generally speaking, it is impossible to make individual purchasers and sellers responsible for a failure to care for the welfare of the others as it relates to income distribution \u2013 this is a problem individuals cannot solve very well. How might the injunction to love one\u2019s neighbour work out in this (very common) case? Dealing with the problem piece-meal through individual charity is unlikely to be completely effective, as individual charity will not be sufficiently systematic in reaching those in need. The answer might be to invoke the power of the political authorities to bring about some redistribution of income. The obvious example is the provision of welfare programmes in most advanced market economies to provide resources to the poor and disadvantaged by taxing the incomes and expenditures of those who have substantial incomes. Such programmes have grown markedly in the past hundred years, and now comprise a major component of government expenditure. This is not straightforward in practice: provision for the poor may have unintended consequences, such as removing incentives to work and creating welfare dependency.\n\nIn addressing this tension, a helpful idea is the notion of an optimal amount of welfare waste. [\u00a03\u00a0] It is commonly understood that to insist on literally zero waste for any economic uses of the environment would be to condemn humanity to dire poverty. What arises from this cautionary tale is the notion of \u2018optimal waste\u2019 \u2013 an amount of environmental waste that is consistent with acceptable levels of human flourishing. [\u00a04\u00a0] In a similar way, any kind of redistribution, or more general welfare, will undoubtedly affect incentives. But the relevant question is whether the policy in question (here redistribution) is nonetheless worth doing despite the \u2018welfare waste\u2019 that this entails.\n\nThere is much in Christian tradition that warns of the dangers of both extreme wealth and extreme poverty, summarised beautifully in Proverbs 30: 8-9, and redistribution deals with both problems at once. This makes it an effective policy because it breaks a maxim in economics (called the Tinbergen rule) that you need as many levers of policies as you have goals. In this case, a single transfer from a very wealthy person to a very poor person fights against the evils of both extreme wealth and extreme poverty. Given this, it is unsurprising to find Christians throughout history calling for redistribution, though other auxiliary assumptions and political convictions have, and will, create diversity in the particular policies endorsed.\n\nAll the issues of anonymity are of course magnified when we consider the plight of those known to us who are living in desperate conditions in places far distant from where we live. The spread of global internet connections and immediate news reporting brings their plight directly to us, and it would be unacceptably callous not to show compassion simply because they are so far away, and so not act to relieve their suffering. But we may need to rely on relief agencies to channel our aid. Deciding on the mix of government and private aid mimics, more or less, the same debates that occur within a nation state about government and private provision of anything, with the exception that the degree of affinity people feel to those \u2018close by\u2019 is generally higher. In the interconnected world of social media, \u2018close by\u2019 does not necessarily refer to distance, though it often does. Where government aid does occur, the case for such involvement is that governments may more adequately and effectively channel the desire of the citizens to reach out to those in need around the globe.\n\nThe call to love neighbours effectively in a complex market economy requires a special kind of love, one infused with a good dose of wisdom. The issue to discern is how to express love when we are very short on the particulars of the persons to love. We might call love which is wise in this way \u2018love at a distance\u2019. We gain encouragement from the observation that Jesus connected \u2018the law and the prophets\u2019 to love (Matt 22:36-40), and the law involved instances of love at a distance, be that geographical or social. A similar sentiment is declared in his Parable of the Good Samaritan, which is an artful blend of love close by and love at an (ethnic) distance (Luke 10:25-37). Laws, including those found in the Old Testament, are paradigmatic ways to love others who are largely anonymous, and sometimes (unlike the Good Samaritan) love-through-law is informed by nothing more specific about the \u2018other\u2019 than the belief that their common human nature deserves reverence and respect.\n\nSo it is with market transactions. It is pleasing, though rare, if market practices and market outcomes are personal but, even if they are impersonal, they should always give due reverence and respect to persons made in the image of God.\n\n1.

Role of Charitable Agencies and International Aid in Tackling World Poverty\n\n[\u00a02\u00a0] How to respond to such cases is often far from straightforward. For example, boycotting goods produced by child labour in a poor country may have the effect of making them and their families destitute, and making it impossible for the parents to pay for even elementary schooling for their children. This is an ever-present danger of boycotts.\n\n[\u00a03\u00a0] For the concept of optimal welfare waste see https://www.abc.net.au/religion/election-2016-in-praise-of-welfare-waste/10096808\n\n[\u00a04\u00a0] A mainstream economist is more likely to put this in more narrow terms of balancing costs and benefits of pollution. This would be fine for a Christian if every aspect of God\u2019s Shalom were included in the enumerated costs and benefits, but this is not usually the case.",

In the interconnected world of social media, \u2018close by\u2019 does not necessarily refer to distance, though it often does. Where government aid does occur, the case for such involvement is that governments may more adequately and effectively channel the desire of the citizens to reach out to those in need around the globe.</p>\n<h2>Market-mediated Love Requires Wisdom</h2>\n<p>The call to love neighbours effectively in a complex market economy requires a special kind of love, one infused with a good dose of wisdom. The issue to discern is how to express love when we are very short on the particulars of the persons to love. We might call love which is wise in this way \u2018love at a distance\u2019. We gain encouragement from the observation that Jesus connected \u2018the law and the prophets\u2019 to love (Matt 22:36-40), and the law involved instances of love at a distance, be that geographical or social. A similar sentiment is declared in his Parable of the Good Samaritan, which is an artful blend of love close by and love at an (ethnic) distance (Luke 10:25-37). Laws, including those found in the Old Testament, are paradigmatic ways to love others who are largely anonymous, and sometimes (unlike the Good Samaritan) love-through-law is informed by nothing more specific about the \u2018other\u2019 than the belief that their common human nature deserves reverence and respect.</p>\n<p>So it is with market transactions. It is pleasing, though rare, if market practices and market outcomes are personal but, even if they are impersonal, they should always give due reverence and respect to persons made in the image of God.</p>\n<h2 class=\"new_page\">References and Further Reading</h2>\n<p>1.

    "bodyText": "An earlier version of this Brief was presented as the opening address of an Oxford Faculty Workshop on \u201cThe Sovereignty of Love\u201d hosted by GFI in partnership with the Lanier Theological Library, Yarnton Manor, 6 June 2025.\n\nI am attracted to the summary sayings in scripture. These passages distil vast theological territory into memorable phrases. The Ten Commandments (Exodus 20:1-17) reduce the complexities of covenant life to \u2018ten words\u2019 (Deut 10:4). Paul's \"trustworthy sayings\" crystallise essential gospel truths into reliable formulations (1 Timothy 1:15, 3:1, 4:9; 2 Timothy 2:11; Titus 3:8). The Shema declares Israel's foundational faith: \"Hear, O Israel: The Lord our God, the Lord is one\" (Deuteronomy 6:4). The Lord\u2019s Prayer (Matt 6:9-13) covers so much of our relational life with the Father.\n\n'Jesus replied: Love the Lord your God with all your heart, and with all your soul, and with all your mind.' This is the first and greatest commandment. And the second is like it: \u2018Love your neighbour as yourself.\u2019 All the Law and the Prophets hang on these two commandments.\u2019 (Matthew 22:37-40 NIV)\n\nPerhaps because I am a mathematical modeller, I cannot help seeing in these summaries a kind of \u2018scriptural model\u2019. A model is a framework that helps us to make sense of something much larger and more complex. A good model is simple \u2013 evoking an \u2018aha\u2019 as things fall into place. It is a seed with plenty of room to grow, and yet everything essential is packed into that small parcel. In contrast, a simplistic model must be unlearned as one goes: as one\u2019s understanding develops, these original thoughts must be discarded.\n\nWhat is so helpful about scriptural models is hat they are themselves part of divine discourse and not abstractions from it. To my mind, this guarantees that they are simple rather than simplistic.\n\nIf we take seriously the idea that these scriptural summaries function as reliable models for understanding complex realities, then we must ask: what happens when we apply this same modelling approach to academic scholarship itself? How might Jesus' Great Commandment serve not just as moral guidance, but as an explanatory framework for academic work?\n\nWhat I admire about O\u2019Donovan\u2019s work is that the echo of the scriptures is resonant in it. I recently heard a famous philosopher discuss these same commands. It was a deep discussion of theories of action and nuances of love, and I am not qualified to give an overall assessment of it. But one thing that did stand out to me was that whenever the discussion turned to things related to the Bible, there was a kind of discomfort in the discourse, as though two kinds of descriptions \u2013 philosophical and theological \u2013 were at war with one another. O\u2019Donovan never gives that impression. His loyalty to scripture and his belief in its fruitfulness shines.\n\nThis theological brief on the Sovereignty of Love provides exactly the kind of analysis the greatest commandment deserves. O\u2019Donovan\u2019s entire piece examines the significance of Jesus\u2019 identification of love as the summary of all moral and religious obligations, and I find his insights both illuminating and challenging for how we might think about academic integration. Colossians 3:14 has long been a significant verse for me, and it rebuts the claim that love is just one virtue among many. It reads: \u2018And over all these virtues put on\u00a0love, which\u00a0binds them all together in\u00a0perfect unity. (NIV)\u2019\n\nO\u2019Donovan defines love as \"affective and directive attention to the good of persons\"\u2014combining genuine feeling with purposeful action that shapes human existence. This definition emerges from an exegesis of Jesus' teaching and reveals several crucial dimensions that I had not fully appreciated before reading his work.\n\nO\u2019Donovan shows that love is not a static principle but an orderly sequence of moments\u2014contemplation and action, sacrifice and enjoyment, decision and habit. Love develops through time, creating what he calls \"a narrative arc that gives shape to a life lived as a whole.\" This temporal understanding prevents us from reducing love to any single moment or expression and seems to get the balance right between analysing relationships in the abstract versus seeing them as biographical and particular.\n\nAs O\u2019Donovan explains, \"on love 'the law and the prophets hang,'\" meaning they derive their intelligibility from it. Love provides insight into Scripture's diverse forms and functions as a form of practical reasoning that resolves seemingly irreconcilable moral demands.\n\nA key point here is that \u2018the law\u2019 includes much of what we moderns would most naturally classify as \u2018justice\u2019. This leads to an intriguing observation that O\u2019Donovan makes, but does not develop fully.\n\nFor Aristotle and Plato, justice served as the supreme, organising principle that coordinated all other virtues - the same role that love plays in Christian ethics.\n\n\"For both these thinkers justice was differentiated by a kind of universality, which put it in a position analogous to that of love in Jesus's teaching.\" This observation was very interesting to me because I recently read Plato\u2019s Republic for the first time, and I was struck by how Plato gives no simple answer to the question, \u2018what is justice?\u2019. Instead, he seems to regard it to be a property of a well-ordered society and person.\n\nO\u2019Donovan has an integration between love and justice in his mind when he says that love seeks justice as its goal in public and social order, but love can go further, providing something that public justice cannot: the personal attention to particular goods and particular people that makes moral action both meaningful and sustainable.\n\nO\u2019Donovan demonstrates that love is fundamentally a way of knowing created goods. His insight that \"to love, we must learn to recognise personal singularity\", while also grasping things \"as\" what they truly are, has profound implications. When we love something appropriately according to its nature, we come to know it more fully.\n\nRelatedly, O\u2019Donovan notes that \"truth is the criterion of both love and knowledge\"\u2014they are not opposed but deeply interconnected. Since he says that the proper target of love is persons, we may extrapolate the following axiom: \u2018When we love people appropriately according to their nature, we come to know them more fully.\u2019 I will return to the profound implications of this axiom below.\n\nO\u2019Donovan's analysis reveals that the goal of connecting scholarship to the love of persons cannot be achieved in isolation.\n\nO\u2019Donovan recognises that some academics work on specialised and impersonal subjects \u2013 such as the mathematicians who worked out the non-Euclidian geometry Einstein worked with, before it had any apparent use. He helpfully guides those who work on specialised knowledge to think of their work as a vocation: to understand the ordering of reality, and to provide education to others. Each of these could lift the spirits of a Christian working in specialised areas, far from persons, and far from an obvious expression of love.\n\nAnother dimension that a scientist shared in response to O\u2019Donovan\u2019s piece is that one has a wholly different appreciation of an exhibition of art if one knows the artist. O\u2019Donovan gives the example of Bach\u2019s wife in this regard, and (as my colleague put it) a scientist studying the most impersonal of physical objects can worship and love God at the same time, as the proverbial artist responsible for the artwork.\n\nDifferent disciplines offer different gifts within Christ's body of scholarly work. A mathematician's love for elegant proofs, a historian's love for understanding human agency, a psychologist's love for behavioural complexity\u2014all contribute to our collective understanding of God's creation. No single discipline captures the full scope of reality, but each offers essential insights when properly ordered towards love.\n\nI now want to outline four areas of O\u2019Donovan\u2019s piece that excited my imagination and, since we are talking about love, warmed my heart.\n\nWhenever I have taught ethics within my discipline of economics, the following question has arisen: does the practice of a virtuous person consist of no more than following good rules and seeking good consequences? If a virtuous person is simply one who meets both of these obligations, then one wonders if placing virtue ethics alongside deontology and consequentialism as the three frameworks for ethics is some kind of category mistake.\n\nO\u2019Donovan\u2019s whole-of-life narrative arc for a loving person seems to open up a notion of virtue ethics that is conceptually distinct from deontology and consequentialism.\n\nOr, to put it another way, his discussion highlights a conceptual problem with the way virtue ethics is conceived. It is supposed to focus on the agent, and yet when it is discussed in academic circles one must imagine an abstract, ahistorical agent. O\u2019Donovan\u2019s discussion of love emphasises knowledge of the particulars of people and created goods. In contrast, any ahistorical approach ignores the predominant way virtue ethics has been used by most people throughout most of history: the cultivation of virtue by the imitation of specific exemplars. Once the ahistorical method for virtue ethics is abandoned for a biographical one, Jesus Christ is a natural place for a Christian ethicist to turn.\n\nJesus is one-of-a-kind, so his identity as the Son of God and his unique mission do rule out following him in, say, the provision of salvation, notwithstanding the general call to imitate him (1 John 2:6, 1 Cor 11:1). Christians are called to imitate Christ with respect to suffering justly (1 Pet 2:21), humble service (John 13:15), sharing his yoke (Matt 11:29) and displaying sacrificial love (John 13:24-25, Eph 5:2, Phil 2:5-8).\n\nThe ideal set of exemplars will include more than Jesus, however. Many important exemplars relate to narratives of repentance and humility after failure (c.f. Ps 51 for adultery and murder). Finally, believers have always needed what scripture cannot provide: contemporary models of Christians living in the same cultural milieu.\n\nSuch a virtue ethic is, of course, already embedded in the practice of many Christian traditions, with longstanding ones more inclined to explicitly recognize past exemplars of faith. An academic agenda where Christian ethicists show more explicit deference to Jesus and Christian exemplars would be in keeping with O\u2019Donovan\u2019s practice of letting theology dictate the categories for academic enquiry, and would help bring Sunday and Monday together for these scholars.\n\nO\u2019Donovan discusses the Hellenistic tendency to use justice as an integrative device in the ancient world, similar to the way Jesus calls Christians to use love. That struck me as a very interesting observation, and I cannot help wondering if what was true of ancient Greece is true today.\n\nWhen I worked at the central bank in Australia, I could have had a discussion with my colleagues that began with the words \u2018I think inflation and unemployment are unjust\u2019. O\u2019Donovan\u2019s article prompts me to imagine an intellectual world where the statement \u2018inflation and unemployment are unloving\u2019 would be taken similarly seriously.\n\nWe are certainly not in such a world.\n\nJohn Rawls, perhaps the most influential political philosopher of the late 20th century, begins his landmark work A Theory of Justice (1971) by declaring that \"Justice is the first virtue of social institutions, as truth is of systems of thought\". The implication is that justice does some of love\u2019s integrative work, as the ancient Greek philosophers claimed. But what would it look like if we Christians could think about love in such a way as to declare \u201cLove is the first virtue of social institutions, as truth is of systems of thought\u201d.\n\nTo think this way requires invoking love in interactions which appear impersonal, and which might otherwise be cast in terms of justice. For example, the far-flung anonymous reaches of the market raise the question of 'distance' in love as it relates to economics. Distance appears in all sorts of contexts and makes the particular actions required of effective love harder to discover. Similarly, there is distance between the agent and 'the person loved' in the way that scientists contribute to the love of persons. When a scientist makes a discovery, there may be many intermediate agents between the discoverer and any final technological user. Medical discoverers are the fortunate position of almost always contributing to human flourishing, whereas other research, such as the splitting of the atom, may contribute to more problematic applications. Nevertheless, once distance is acknowledged, there are good ways of running markets or organising the uses of academic discoveries which we might be tempted to call \u2018justice\u2019. I would prefer to call them \u2018love at a distance\u2019.\n\nPerhaps we are making this error, and perhaps this is why it has taken so long to have the conversation we are having today. It may also be one reason why we might feel more embarrassed to quote Jesus in an academic seminar than we would to quote Plato or Aristotle.\n\nO\u2019Donovan writes that in order to love we must grasp things as they truly are and, when we love something appropriately according to its nature, we come to know it more fully. As he so beautifully puts it: \"truth is the criterion of both love and knowledge\". So, I take it that knowledge is both a requirement and a result of love. Secondly, O\u2019Donovan says that the ultimate telos of love is persons.\n\nPutting the two together, we may say that to love properly \u2013 that is, to love persons \u2013 we must understand persons as they truly are, and that the act of loving them will teach us what those persons truly are.\n\nAn important implication of this is that a failure to love distorts not just our character but our apprehension of the world, which theologians call a noetic effect of sin.\n\nThere is in fact a correspondence between O\u2019Donovan\u2019s account of the Greatest Command and Emil Brunner\u2019s (1946) account of the noetic effects of sin. What is common to both is the centrality of persons. To return to my introductory theme, namely modelling, I think O\u2019Donovan\u2019s implicit account of persons gives us a high-level model for understanding Brunner\u2019s noetic effects of sin.\n\nBrunner argued that sin's distorting effects on human knowledge operate along a spectrum. Mathematical and natural scientific knowledge sits far from what he called the Personkern \u2014the personal centre of human existence\u2014because they deal with impersonal phenomena. Economics occupies a middle position, dealing with human behaviour, but often through aggregated, statistical patterns that obscure individual personality. Disciplines like History, Ethics, Theology, Law and Psychology, however, sit very close to the Personkern because they fundamentally concern human agency, decisions, and the meaning of personal and collective actions. [\u00a01\u00a0]\n\nHere is the model:\n\nAn economist may fail to acknowledge a spiritual component to people and treat them as rats in a maze responding to stimuli. A psychologist may have a conception of human autonomy that exacerbates selfishness and godlessness. A sociologist may fail to see individuals at all, seeing only a generic group-person, a product of social forces. All these errors, and others, lead to failures in love, which further cloud our understanding.\n\nPaul's image of the body of Christ (1 Cor 12) is germane for any academic. Just as the body requires different members with diverse functions, Christian scholarship requires a community of scholars with different expertise working together to serve love's purposes.\n\nI have learnt from O\u2019Donovan\u2019s vision that fellowship with other academics has a value that goes beyond helping us to publish, or explain and display our faith to our colleagues, or to manage our time. It should be part of our vision to celebrate how academic life leads to loving outcomes.\n\nAs an academic economist, I like to think of myself as part of a community which occasionally makes a big impact, and I am encouraged by stories of the really big impacts economics has made in history, such as how economic policy deals with crises far more effectively now than it did in the past. But others might like to hear more about how small acts can have small but real effects. Universities are already seeing the need to do this. The kind of story about love\u2019s impact that a particular person finds encouraging may vary, but O\u2019Donovan\u2019s overall vision of contributing to a wide community is surely correct. And his emphasis on teaching reminds me to include both my current and past students within my conception of my own academic community.\n\nThis response to Oliver O\u2019Donovan\u2019s Sovereignty of Love does not cover every avenue for exploration, but I hope it prompts a number of conversations, some of which will be carried out by those in disciplines far from my own. For any conceptual mistakes buried within my observations, I apologise in advance. Hopefully, these can be corrected by other Christians in the academic community.\n\nWe need fellowship not only to correct each other, but because integration is not an easy journey. If Brunner is right, social scientists and others who work close to the Personkern face the difficulty that persons are both what we should love most (as Jesus taught) and what we academics distort the most.\n\nAnd if the Hellenistic tendency to use justice as a master-virtue has continued, we may all be off course by speaking the language of justice when (sometimes) the language of love is better. There is, in fact, a strange disconnect between the regular and wide-ranging appearance of love in ordinary discourse (and the teaching of the scriptures) and its notable absence on the lips of our colleagues. In ordinary life, it preserves considerable semantic range that integrates justice, such as when we speak of \u2018tough love\u2019. But in the academy, there is a real question about whether justice has overtaken love as the integrative principle, as it did in Ancient Greece.\n\nNaturally, one is at liberty to disagree with O\u2019Donovan\u2019s perspective on the Great Commandment, but a Christian person is not at liberty to disagree with Jesus himself. However one reads Jesus, he said the love command is the \u2018greatest\u2019. As Christian academics, we cannot merely echo Jesus' declaration in our personal lives while ignoring it \u2013 and indeed him \u2013 in our scholarly method.\n\nThere was a time in the history of the West when becoming an academic meant joining a spiritual order. That had its downsides, and I for one greatly appreciate the contributions of people with very different worldviews to myself. Nevertheless, if we are to move beyond the reductionist impasse that has plagued the Humanities, we may need to recover something of that earlier integration\u2014not the institutional constraints, but the recognition that love is both method and meaning. Organisations like GFI and the Lanier Theological Library are already demonstrating what this alternative looks like, building intellectual communities that refuse to compartmentalise Christian faith and rigorous inquiry. I want to thank O\u2019Donovan for his very stimulating and spiritually wise reflections in The Sovereignty of Love , which shows us that returning love to its rightful place in academic discourse is not a retreat from good scholarship, but an advancement towards it.\n\nBrunner, Emil.

Cambridge, MA: Harvard University Press, 1971.\n\n[\u00a01\u00a0] To quote Brunner \u201cThe nearer anything lies to that centre of existence [ Personkern ] in which we are concerned with its totality \u2013 that is our relation to God, and our personal existence \u2013 the greater the disruption of rational knowledge through sin. The further that something lies from this centre, the less the impact of this disrupting factor, with a corresponding reduction in the difference between the knowledge of the believer and the unbeliever.\u201d (1946, 383)",

Love provides insight into Scripture's diverse forms and functions as a form of practical reasoning that resolves seemingly irreconcilable moral demands.</p>\n<p>A key point here is that \u2018the law\u2019 includes much of what we moderns would most naturally classify as \u2018justice\u2019. This leads to an intriguing observation that O\u2019Donovan makes, but does not develop fully.</p>\n<h3>Love and Justice Battle for Integrative Supremacy</h3>\n<p>For Aristotle and Plato, justice served as the supreme, organising principle that coordinated all other virtues - the same role that love plays in Christian ethics.</p>\n<p>\"For both these thinkers justice was differentiated by a kind of universality, which put it in a position analogous to that of love in Jesus's teaching.\" This observation was very interesting to me because I recently read Plato\u2019s <em>Republic</em> for the first time, and I was struck by how Plato gives no simple answer to the question, \u2018what is justice?\u2019. Instead, he seems to regard it to be a property of a well-ordered society and person.</p>\n<p>O\u2019Donovan has an integration between love and justice in his mind when he says that love seeks justice as its goal in public and social order, but love can go further, providing something that public justice cannot: the personal attention to particular goods and particular people that makes moral action both meaningful and sustainable.</p>\n<h3>Love is an Epistemological Framework</h3>\n<p>O\u2019Donovan demonstrates that love is fundamentally a way of knowing created goods. His insight that \"to love, we must learn to recognise personal singularity\", while also grasping things \"as\" what they truly are, has profound implications. When we love something appropriately according to its nature, we come to know it more fully.</p>\n<p>Relatedly, O\u2019Donovan notes that \"truth is the criterion of both love and knowledge\"\u2014they are not opposed but deeply interconnected. Since he says that the proper target of love is persons, we may extrapolate the following axiom: \u2018When we love people appropriately according to their nature, we come to know them more fully.\u2019 I will return to the profound implications of this axiom below.</p>\n<h3>Love is Practiced in (Academic) Community\u00a0</h3>\n<p>O\u2019Donovan's analysis reveals that the goal of connecting scholarship to the love of persons cannot be achieved in isolation.</p>\n<p>O\u2019Donovan recognises that some academics work on specialised and impersonal subjects \u2013 such as the mathematicians who worked out the non-Euclidian geometry Einstein worked with, before it had any apparent use. He helpfully guides those who work on specialised knowledge to think of their work as a vocation: to understand the ordering of reality, and to provide education to others. Each of these could lift the spirits of a Christian working in specialised areas, far from persons, and far from an obvious expression of love.</p>\n<p>Another dimension that a scientist shared in response to O\u2019Donovan\u2019s piece is that one has a wholly different appreciation of an exhibition of art if one knows the artist. O\u2019Donovan gives the example of Bach\u2019s wife in this regard, and (as my colleague put it) a scientist studying the most impersonal of physical objects can worship and love God at the same time, as the proverbial artist responsible for the artwork.</p>\n<p>Different disciplines offer different gifts within Christ's body of scholarly work. A mathematician's love for elegant proofs, a historian's love for understanding human agency, a psychologist's love for behavioural complexity\u2014all contribute to our collective understanding of God's creation. No single discipline captures the full scope of reality, but each offers essential insights when properly ordered towards love.</p>\n<h2>My Own Response to Love's Sovereignty</h2>\n<p>I now want to outline four areas of O\u2019Donovan\u2019s piece that excited my imagination and, since we are talking about love, warmed my heart.</p>\n<h3>On Love\u2019s Historical Nature: Redeeming Virtue from Abstraction</h3>\n<p>Whenever I have taught ethics within my discipline of economics, the following question has arisen: does the practice of a virtuous person consist of no more than following good rules and seeking good consequences? If a virtuous person is simply one who meets both of these obligations, then one wonders if placing virtue ethics alongside deontology and consequentialism as the three frameworks for ethics is some kind of category mistake.</p>\n<p>O\u2019Donovan\u2019s whole-of-life narrative arc for a loving person seems to open up a notion of virtue ethics that is conceptually distinct from deontology and consequentialism.</p>\n<p>Or, to put it another way, his discussion highlights a conceptual problem with the way virtue ethics is conceived. It is supposed to focus on the agent, and yet when it is discussed in academic circles one must imagine an abstract, ahistorical agent. O\u2019Donovan\u2019s discussion of love emphasises knowledge of the particulars of people and created goods. In contrast, any ahistorical approach ignores the predominant way virtue ethics has been used by most people throughout most of history: the cultivation of virtue by the imitation of specific exemplars. Once the ahistorical method for virtue ethics is abandoned for a biographical one, Jesus Christ is a natural place for a Christian ethicist to turn.</p>\n<p>Jesus is one-of-a-kind, so his identity as the Son of God and his unique mission do rule out following him in, say, the provision of salvation, notwithstanding the general call to imitate him (1 John 2:6, 1 Cor 11:1). Christians are called to imitate Christ with respect to suffering justly (1 Pet 2:21), humble service (John 13:15), sharing his yoke (Matt 11:29) and displaying sacrificial love (John 13:24-25, Eph 5:2, Phil 2:5-8).</p>\n<p>The ideal set of exemplars will include more than Jesus, however. Many important exemplars relate to narratives of repentance and humility after failure (c.f. Ps 51 for adultery and murder). Finally, believers have always needed what scripture cannot provide: contemporary models of Christians living in the same cultural milieu.</p>\n<p>Such a virtue ethic is, of course, already embedded in the practice of many Christian traditions, with longstanding ones more inclined to explicitly recognize past exemplars of faith. An <em>academic</em> agenda where Christian ethicists show more explicit deference to Jesus and Christian exemplars would be in keeping with O\u2019Donovan\u2019s practice of letting theology dictate the categories for academic enquiry, and would help bring Sunday and Monday together for these scholars.</p>\n<h3>On Love as Hermeneutical Key and Supreme Integrator</h3>\n<p>O\u2019Donovan discusses the Hellenistic tendency to use justice as an integrative device in the ancient world, similar to the way Jesus calls Christians to use love. That struck me as a very interesting observation, and I cannot help wondering if what was true of ancient Greece is true today.</p>\n<p>When I worked at the central bank in Australia, I could have had a discussion with my colleagues that began with the words \u2018I think inflation and unemployment are unjust\u2019. O\u2019Donovan\u2019s article prompts me to imagine an intellectual world where the statement \u2018inflation and unemployment are unloving\u2019 would be taken similarly seriously.</p>\n<p>We are certainly not in such a world.</p>\n<p>John Rawls, perhaps the most influential political philosopher of the late 20th century, begins his landmark work <em>A Theory of Justice</em> (1971) by declaring that \"Justice is the first virtue of social institutions, as truth is of systems of thought\". The implication is that justice does some of love\u2019s integrative work, as the ancient Greek philosophers claimed. But what would it look like if we Christians could think about love in such a way as to declare \u201cLove is the first virtue of social institutions, as truth is of systems of thought\u201d.</p>\n<p>To think this way requires invoking love in interactions which appear impersonal, and which might otherwise be cast in terms of justice. For example, the far-flung anonymous reaches of the market raise the question of 'distance' in love as it relates to economics. Distance appears in all sorts of contexts and makes the particular actions required of effective love harder to discover. Similarly, there is distance between the agent and 'the person loved' in the way that scientists contribute to the love of persons. When a scientist makes a discovery, there may be many intermediate agents between the discoverer and any final technological user. Medical discoverers are the fortunate position of almost always contributing to human flourishing, whereas other research, such as the splitting of the atom, may contribute to more problematic applications. Nevertheless, once distance is acknowledged, there are good ways of running markets or organising the uses of academic discoveries which we might be tempted to call \u2018justice\u2019. I would prefer to call them \u2018love at a distance\u2019.</p>\n<p>O\u2019Donovan himself has not made the mistake of using justice where love should be used \u2013 indeed the whole purpose of his Theology Brief is precisely to reclaim the sovereignty of love over all usurpers, which I assume includes justice. But perhaps our contemporaries, or indeed we ourselves, have made the mistake of following Rawls by dethroning love as the integrator and replacing it with justice. This is not to write off Rawls, who was seeking to rescue us from thinking only in terms of power; but one can still ask if we are committing the error of the ancient Greeks.</p>\n<p>Perhaps we are making this error, and perhaps this is why it has taken so long to have the conversation we are having today. It may also be one reason why we might feel more embarrassed to quote Jesus in an academic seminar than we would to quote Plato or Aristotle.</p>\n<h3>Love as an Epistemological Framework and Failure-to-Love as a Degrader of the Humanities</h3>\n<p>O\u2019Donovan writes that in order to love we must grasp things as they truly are and, when we love something appropriately according to its nature, we come to know it more fully. As he so beautifully puts it: \"truth is the criterion of both love and knowledge\". So, I take it that knowledge is both a requirement and a result of love. Secondly, O\u2019Donovan says that the ultimate telos of love is persons.</p>\n<p>Putting the two together, we may say that to love properly \u2013 that is, to love persons \u2013 we must understand persons as they truly are, and that the act of loving them will teach us what those persons truly are.</p>\n<p>An important implication of this is that a failure to love distorts not just our character but our apprehension of the world, which theologians call a noetic effect of sin.</p>\n<p>There is in fact a correspondence between O\u2019Donovan\u2019s account of the Greatest Command and Emil Brunner\u2019s (1946) account of the noetic effects of sin. What is common to both is the centrality of persons. To return to my introductory theme, namely modelling, I think O\u2019Donovan\u2019s implicit account of persons gives us a high-level model for understanding Brunner\u2019s noetic effects of sin.</p>\n<p>Brunner argued that sin's distorting effects on human knowledge operate along a spectrum. Mathematical and natural scientific knowledge sits far from what he called the <em>Personkern</em>\u2014the personal centre of human existence\u2014because they deal with impersonal phenomena. Economics occupies a middle position, dealing with human behaviour, but often through aggregated, statistical patterns that obscure individual personality. Disciplines like History, Ethics, Theology, Law and Psychology, however, sit very close to the <em>Personkern</em> because they fundamentally concern human agency, decisions, and the meaning of personal and collective actions.<sup>\u00a0</sup><a class=\"anchor\" id=\"content100note1anc\" name=\"content100note1anc\"> </a><a class=\"note\" href=\"#content100note1sym\">[\u00a01\u00a0]</a></p>\n<p class=\"center\"><img alt=\"Personkern Model\" class=\"inline-figure-600\" data-entity-type=\"file\" data-entity-uuid=\"a902f90b-94d9-4134-a2fb-f30043705ec0\" height=\"453\" loading=\"lazy\" src=\"https://facultyinitiative.net/sites/default/files/inline-images/menzies_love.png\" width=\"639\"/></p>\n<p>Here is the model:</p>\n<p>An economist may fail to acknowledge a spiritual component to people and treat them as rats in a maze responding to stimuli. A psychologist may have a conception of human autonomy that exacerbates selfishness and godlessness. A sociologist may fail to see individuals at all, seeing only a generic group-person, a product of social forces. All these errors, and others, lead to failures in love, which further cloud our understanding.</p>\n<h3>On Love as Practiced in the Academic Community</h3>\n<p>Paul's image of the body of Christ (1 Cor 12) is germane for any academic. Just as the body requires different members with diverse functions, Christian scholarship requires a community of scholars with different expertise working together to serve love's purposes.</p>\n<p>I have learnt from O\u2019Donovan\u2019s vision that fellowship with other academics has a value that goes beyond helping us to publish, or explain and display our faith to our colleagues, or to manage our time. It should be part of our vision to celebrate how academic life leads to loving outcomes.</p>\n<p>As an academic economist, I like to think of myself as part of a community which occasionally makes a big impact, and I am encouraged by stories of the really big impacts economics has made in history, such as how economic policy deals with crises far more effectively now than it did in the past. But others might like to hear more about how small acts can have small but real effects. Universities are already seeing the need to do this. The kind of story about love\u2019s impact that a particular person finds encouraging may vary, but O\u2019Donovan\u2019s overall vision of contributing to a wide community is surely correct. And his emphasis on teaching reminds me to include both my current and past students within my conception of my own academic community.</p>\n<h2>Summary</h2>\n<p>This response to Oliver O\u2019Donovan\u2019s <em>Sovereignty of Love</em> does not cover every avenue for exploration, but I hope it prompts a number of conversations, some of which will be carried out by those in disciplines far from my own. For any conceptual mistakes buried within my observations, I apologise in advance. Hopefully, these can be corrected by other Christians in the academic community.</p>\n<p>We need fellowship not only to correct each other, but because integration is not an easy journey. If Brunner is right, social scientists and others who work close to the <em>Personkern</em> face the difficulty that persons are both what we should love most (as Jesus taught) and what we academics distort the most.</p>\n<p>And if the Hellenistic tendency to use justice as a master-virtue has continued, we may all be off course by speaking the language of justice when (sometimes) the language of love is better. There is, in fact, a strange disconnect between the regular and wide-ranging appearance of love in ordinary discourse (and the teaching of the scriptures) and its notable absence on the lips of our colleagues. In ordinary life, it preserves considerable semantic range that integrates justice, such as when we speak of \u2018tough love\u2019. But in the academy, there is a real question about whether justice has overtaken love as the integrative principle, as it did in Ancient Greece.</p>\n<p>Naturally, one is at liberty to disagree with O\u2019Donovan\u2019s perspective on the Great Commandment, but a Christian person is not at liberty to disagree with Jesus himself. However one reads Jesus, he said the love command is the \u2018greatest\u2019. As Christian academics, we cannot merely echo Jesus' declaration in our personal lives while ignoring it \u2013 and indeed him \u2013 in our scholarly method.</p>\n<p>There was a time in the history of the West when becoming an academic meant joining a spiritual order. That had its downsides, and I for one greatly appreciate the contributions of people with very different worldviews to myself. Nevertheless, if we are to move beyond the reductionist impasse that has plagued the Humanities, we may need to recover something of that earlier integration\u2014not the institutional constraints, but the recognition that love is both method and meaning. Organisations like GFI and the Lanier Theological Library are already demonstrating what this alternative looks like, building intellectual communities that refuse to compartmentalise Christian faith and rigorous inquiry. I want to thank O\u2019Donovan for his very stimulating and spiritually wise reflections in <em>The Sovereignty of Love</em>, which shows us that returning love to its rightful place in academic discourse is not a retreat from good scholarship, but an advancement towards it.</p>\n<h2 class=\"new_page\">References</h2>\n<p>Brunner, Emil.\u00a0<em>Revelation and Reason: The Christian Doctrine of Faith and Knowledge</em>.
